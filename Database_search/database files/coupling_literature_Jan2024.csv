   on delta-N-15 and delta-C-13 contents in plants and animals in natural
   ecosystems.
   In the estuary, the variation of isotope ratios were principally
   governed by the mixing of land-derived organic matter, marine
   phytoplankton, and seagrasses.  A clear cut linear relationship between
   animal delta-N-15 and its trophic level was obtained in the Antarctic
   food chain system.
   Several current efforts to use the stable isotopes for food web analysis

   the influence oi food web structure on carbon flux between lakes and the

   predators caused shifts in grazers. At identical nutrient loading, C-atm
   invasion was greater to a lake with low grazing than to one with high
   grazing. Carbon stable-isotope distributions corroborated the drawdown
   of lake carbon dioxide and traced C-atm transfer from algae to top

   invasions in lakes",NATURE,"Species invasions pose a serious threat to biodiversity and native
   ecosystems(1,2); however, predicting and quantifying the impacts of
   invasive species has proven problematic(3-6). Here we use stable isotope
   ratios to document the food-web consequences of the invasion of two
   non-native predators, smallmouth bass and rack bass, into Canadian
   lakes. Invaded lakes had lower littoral prey-fish diversity and
   abundance than uninvaded reference lakes. Consistent with this
   difference, lake trout from invaded lakes had more negative delta(13)C
   values (-29.2 parts per thousand versus -27.4 parts per thousand) and
   reduced trophic positions (3.3 versus 3.9) than those from reference
   lakes, indicating differences in food-web structure, Furthermore, a
   comparison of the pre- and post-invasion food webs of two recently
   invaded lakes showed that invasion was followed by substantial declines
   in littoral prey-fish abundance and the trophic position of lake trout,
   reflecting a shift in the diet of lake trout towards zooplankton and
   reduced dependence on littoral fish. This study demonstrates the use of
   stable isotope techniques to detect changes in food-web structure

Therefore a model food chain was established feeding cultivated woodlice (Porcellio dilatatus) on a cellulolytic fungus (Chaetomium globosum) grown on cellulose paper. Two diets of different quality (C:N ratios of 54 vs. 200) with different delta15N- (1.3% vs. 3.1%) but identical delta13C-values caused low and high dietary stress in animals of treatment A and B, respectively. After an incubation time of 7 weeks amount, elemental and isotopic composition of collected faeces and exuviae as well as woodlice and remaining food were determined. The increase of delta15N-values of woodlice relative to the diet was 5.7% and 2.5% in treatments A and B, respectively, whereas delta13C-shifts were 1.0% and 1.6%, showing a reverse relationship. Modelling of elemental and isotopic mass balances indicated that faeces recycling explains the unexpected high 15N-enrichments. Moreover, 13C-enrichments were positively correlated to the degree of starvation. Considering the effects of starvation and recycling of faeces, stable isotopes represent a useful tool to elucidate trophic interactions in regenerating food webs.",10.1080/10256010008036388 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MJ {Vander Zanden} and JB Rasmussen,2002,"Food web perspectives on studies of bass populations in north-temperate
   lakes",NA,"There is growing recognition of the potential contributions of food web
   and ecosystem-level approaches to lake and fisheries management. Often,
   these approaches are data intensive and require information on
   predator-prey interactions and consumer diets. Gut content analysis
   adequately provides population-level diet information, but is more
   limited in ability to provide information at finer (intra-population) or
   coarser (whole food web) organizational scales. In this study, we review
   three applications of stable isotope techniques to studies of bass
   trophic ecology. In each case, the approach is used to provide
   quantitative information at organizational levels that is otherwise
   difficult to obtain using gut content analysis. In the first example, we
   examine intra-population trophic variation in young-of-the-year (YOY)
   smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu. delta(13)C indicated ontogenic
   trophic habitat shifts from pelagic to benthic prey during first summer.
   delta(15)N was correlated with body size on the final sample date,
   suggesting that dietary differences might explain intra-population
   variation in growth rates. The second example demonstrates an
   application of stable isotope techniques to examine impacts of species
   invasion at the whole-food web scale. This approach revealed that lake
   trout Salvelinus namaycush, typically viewed as a pelagic predator, can
   often rely heavily on littoral prey fish.-Reduction in littoral prey
   fish following the invasion of nonnative smallmouth bass and rock bass
   Ambloplites rupestris prompted lake trout to shift towards planktivory.
   The third example uses stable isotope information to classify lakes
   according to their sensitivity to bass invasion. Stable isotope evidence
   indicated that bass and lake trout subsist on separate food chains in
   lakes that contain pelagic prey fish (cisco, lake whitefish, rainbow
   smelt). Thus, bass introductions into these lakes is predicted not to
   affect lake trout populations. Identifying particular lakes and
   lake-types that are sensitive to bass introductions can guide efforts of
   lake managers to minimize negative impacts of bass introductions on lake
   trout.",NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

   native bush (mainly tree leaves and dicotyledonous seeds) and exotic
   pasture settings (mainly grass stems and monocotyledonous seeds) were
   dominated by allochthonous material. More detritus occurred in stomachs
   in autumn-winter than in spring-summer, but quantities were similar in
   crayfish from native bush and pasture streams. The stomachs of larger
   crayfish contained a significantly greater proportion of detritus than
   smaller individuals. Aquatic invertebrates were the second most abundant
   dietary category by volume, with highest values in winter, but there
   were no significant differences between land uses or crayfish size
   classes. A wide range of invertebrates was eaten by crayfish, with
   mayfly nymphs, chironomid larvae, and snails predominating. The latter
   were numerically more prominent in crayfish from bush than pasture
   streams. Terrestrial invertebrates were recorded from 4\% of stomachs,
   but there were no significant differences in relation to land use,
   season, or crayfish size class. Despite aquatic invertebrates making up
   <4\% of stomach volumes on average, stable isotope analysis indicated a
   greater importance for invertebrate prey in terms of assimilation and
   incorporation into crayfish biomass. Allochthonous detritus and moss
   appeared to be unimportant. Whereas the results of stomach analysis
   provided some evidence of an ontogenetic shift, with detritus assuming
   greater importance in larger crayfish, this pattern was not supported by
   isotope analysis because invertebrate prey appeared more important to

   to provide a basis for assessing large-scale direct (e.g. fisheries) and

   predator to prey species in marine food webs. We applied these methods

   community: evidence from stable-isotope analysis, size-spectra and
   community metrics",MARINE BIOLOGY,"Fishing has wide-ranging impacts on marine ecosystems. One of the most
   pervasive signs of intensive fishing is ``fishing down the food web{''},
   with landings increasingly dominated by smaller species from lower
   trophic levels. Decreases in the trophic level of landings are assumed
   to reflect those in fish communities, because size-selective mortality
   causes decreases in the relative abundance of larger species and in mean
   body size within species. However, existing analyses of fishing impacts
   on the trophic level of fish communities have focused on the role of
   changes in species composition rather than size composition. This will
   provide a biased assessment of the magnitude of fishing impacts, because
   fishes feed at different trophic levels as they grow. Here, we combine
   body size versus trophic level relationships for North Sea fishes
   (trophic level assessed using nitrogen stable-isotope analysis) with
   species-size-abundance data from two time-series of trawl-survey data
   (whole North Sea 1982-2000, central and northern North Sea 1925-1996) to
   predict long-term trends in the trophic structure of the North Sea fish
   community. Analyses of the 1982-2000 time-series showed that there was a
   slow but progressive decline in the trophic level of the demersal
   community, while there was no trend in the trophic level of the combined
   pelagic and demersal community. Analyses of the longer time-series
   suggested that there was no trend in the trophic level of the demersal
   community. We related temporal changes in trophic level to temporal
   changes in the slopes of normalised biomass size-spectra (which
   theoretically represent the trophic structure of the community), mean
   1092 body mass and mean 1092 maximum body mass. While the size-based
   metrics of community structure showed long-term trends that were
   consistent with the effects of increased fishery exploitation, these
   trends were only correlated with trophic level for the demersal
   community. Our analysis suggests that the effects of fishing on the
   trophic structure of fish communities can be much more complex than
   previously assumed. This is a consequence of sampled communities not
   reflecting all the pathways of energy transfer in a marine ecosystem and
   of the absence of historical data on temporal and spatial changes in the
   trophic level of individuals. For the North Sea fish community, changes
   in size structure due to the differential effects of fishing on species
   and populations with different life histories are a stronger and more
   universal indicator of fishing effects than changes in mean trophic

   communities in the Lake Tahoe (California-Nevada) Basin",ECOSYSTEMS,"Plans for the restoration of aquatic ecosystems are increasingly
   focusing on the restoration and rehabilitation of self-sustaining native
   fish communities. Such efforts have not traditionally adopted an
   ecosystem-based perspective, which considers species as embedded within
   a broader food web context. In this study, we quantify food web changes
   in Lake Tahoe (California-Nevada) over the last century based on stable
   isotope analysis of museum-archived, preserved fish specimens collected
   during 4 historical periods and under present conditions. We also
   examine the contemporary food web of nearby Cascade Lake, which is free
   from most exotic species and contains a species assemblage resembling
   that of Lake Tahoe prior to historical species introductions. During the
   last century, the freshwater shrimp Mysis relicta and lake trout
   (Salvelinus namay-cush) have been introduced and established in Lake
   Tahoe, and the native top predator, Lahontan cutthroat trout
   (Oncorhynchus clarki henshawi; hereafter LCT), has been extirpated.
   Isotope analysis indicates that lake trout now occupy a trophic niche
   similar to that of historical LCT. Fish production has shifted from
   benthic to pelagic, corresponding with the eutrophication of Lake Tahoe
   during recent decades. The current Cascade Lake food web resembles that
   of the historical Lake Tahoe food web. Our isotope-based food web
   reconstructions reveal long-term food web changes in Lake Tahoe and can
   serve as the basis for setting historically relevant restoration
   targets. Unfortunately, the presence of normative species, particularly
   Mysis and lake trout, have dramatically altered the pelagic food web
   structure; as such, they are barriers to native fish community
   restoration. Fish community restoration efforts should focus on adjacent
   ecosystems, such as Cascade Lake, which have a high likelihood of
   success because they have not been heavily affected by normative

   lakes",ECOSYSTEMS,"Rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) is a recent invader to the lakes of the
   Hudson Bay drainage in northwestern Ontario, Canada. In some systems,
   the invasion has been linked to an increase in mercury (Hg)
   concentration in native predatory fish. This increase may be due to the
   fact that rainbow smelt are trophically elevated and thus accumulate
   more Ho than native forage fish species. To test this hypothesis, we
   compared the trophic positions and Hg concentrations of rainbow smelt
   and native forage fish in a series of smelt-invaded and reference lakes
   in northwestern Ontario. A comparison of forage fish delta(15)N (anindex
   of trophic position) between the smelt-invaded and reference lakes
   indicated that rainbow smelt moved into a trophic niche that was
   unoccupied prior to their arrival. Relationships between delta(15)N and
   body size and between Hg concentration and body size differed among the
   forage species. This indicates that the response of predator Hg
   concentrations to smelt invasion depends on both the species and size
   composition of their pre-versus post-invasion diet. At a standardized
   body mass of 10 g, rainbow smelt were significantly trophically elevated
   relative to most native forage species, but they did not have

   fossil humans from Europe and the Near East. The microwear patterns
   observed suggest that a major shift in human dietary habits and food
   processing techniques might have taken place in the transition from the
   Middle to the Late Pleistocene populations. Differences in microwear
   density, average length, and orientation of striations indicate that
   Middle Pleistocene humans had more abrasive dietary habits than Late
   Pleistocene populations. Both dietary and cultural factors might be
   responsible for the differences observed. In addition, the Middle
   Paleolithic Neandertal specimens studied show a highly heterogeneous
   pattern of microwear when compared to the other samples considered,
   which is inconsistent with a hypothesis of all Neandertals having a
   strictly carnivorous diet. The high density of striations observed in
   the buccal surfaces of several Neandertal teeth might be indicative of
   the inclusion of plant foods in their diet. The buccal microwear
   variability observed in the Neandertals is compatible with an overall
   exploitation of both plant and meat foods on the basis of food
   availability. A preliminary analysis of the relationship between buccal
   microwear density and climatic conditions prevailing in Europe during
   the Late Pleistocene has been attempted. Cold climatic conditions, as

   This study determined regional variations in long-term elemental

   West Greenland, the Northeast Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea in 1998.
   The diagnostics tested included mercury (Hg), selenium (Se) and cadmium

   baleen. Supporting data was also gathered on delta(15)N and delta(13)C
   and stable lead isotope ratios.
   For female whales, significant differences in at least one long-term
   diagnostic element occurred between several areas. Existence of the
   following population substructure was inferred: (a) West Greenland, (b)
   a central group represented by whales from Jan Mayen, (c) a northeastern
   stock encompassing the Barents Sea, Svalbard and coastal Norway, and (d)
   the North Sea. These groups were consistent with those defined
   genetically by Andersen et al. {[}Mar. Ecol., Prog. Ser. 247 (2003)

   because of smaller sample sizes fewer significant differences occurred
   between areas.
   Stable-isotopic values in minke whales suggested lower trophic-level
   feeding in this species than hitherto suspected, with significant
   dietary differences between areas. Variations in feeding habits appeared
   to explain part of the geographical variation in tissue Cd, but not
   tissue Hg or Se.
   Differences among elements with a relatively long biological half-life
   in specific tissues suggested that groups of minke whales have fidelity
   to certain summer feeding areas at least for several years. Crown

   pelagic prey fishes, the trophic niche of lake trout depends on the
   presence of bass; lake trout feed primarily on zooplankton in the
   presence of bass, and minnows in the absence of bass. Of the 3046 lakes,
   the 788 take trout lakes in central Ontario were classified according to
   their vulnerability to bass invasion based on the predictability of bass
   occurrence and their subsequent impacts, and mapped in a Geographic
   Information System (GIS). Only 48 lake trout lakes (6\%) were classified
   as ``high vulnerability{''}-predicted to be invaded and impacted by
   bass. Another 301 lakes had a sensitive food web structure but were not
   predicted to support a bass population. Based on this information,

   headwater food webs in seven headwater streams in the Upper
   Chattahoochee basin, GA, U.S.A where percentage forest in catchments

   crop and determined consumer (crayfish and insectivorous fish)
   dependence on terrestrial versus aquatic energy sources via gut content
   and stable isotope analyses.
   2. Standing crop of coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) declined
   with deforestation at large scales (i.e. catchment deforestation and
   riparian deforestation at the entire stream network scale). Terrestrial
   plant matter, the dominant component of crayfish guts, declined in
   crayfish guts with reductions in CPOM standing crop and with
   deforestation.
   3. Crayfish and insectivorous fish delta(13)C showed enrichment trends
   with deforestation, indicating isotopic divergence from CPOM, the most
   C-13-depleted basal resource, with reductions in catchment and riparian
   forest cover. Crayfish delta(13)C also exhibited enrichment with
   decreased instream CPOM standing crop.
   4. A concentration-dependent mixing model was used to calculate the
   relative dependence of crayfish and fish on terrestrial versus aquatic

   biomass and 2X higher plant surface area in exotic than in native plant
   beds (quillworts, milfoils, and charophytes) contributed to greater

   Invertebrate communities were less dense (1890/m(2) vs 4030/m(2)) and

   of brown shrimp and grass shrimp were similar between areas, habitat

   SAV and daytime dissolved oxygen concentrations. The response by

   quality attributes of food production is increasing, creating a need for
   reliable indicators of such factors. Here we test the hypothesis that
   cattle farming systems create unique and meaningful isotopic
   fingerprints, which can be characterized by analysing cattle tail switch
   hair. To this end we analysed feeding practices and nutrient fluxes, and
   sampled hair, feed components and fertilizers from 13 different farms in
   Upper Bavaria, Germany. The farms represented the range of cattle
   farming types present in the region and included: conventional
   confinement dairy, pasture based organic and conventional dairy, suckler
   cow, and bull and steer and heifer fattening enterprises. Samples were
   analysed for their carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stable isotope
   composition (delta C-13 and delta N-15). Feed samples could be assigned
   to one of three groups with characteristic delta C-13, which varied very
   little between and within farms: C-3 forages (including fresh forage,
   hay or silage from grassland and clover-grass mixtures) with -28.4 parts
   per thousand (+/- 0.5 parts per thousand S.D.), maize (Zea mays L.) with
   -12.5 parts per thousand (+/- 0.4 parts per thousand), and C-3-derived
   concentrates (including mainly cereal grain and legume seeds) with -26.8
   (+/- 1.1 parts per thousand). The dry matter fraction of maize in the
   diet explained 96\% of the farm average delta C-13 of hair. Hair was
   approx. 2.7 parts per thousand enriched in C-13 relative to the diet
   (trophic level shift), and this effect was very similar for growing
   animals and cows, and seemingly independent of the fraction of maize in
   the diet. In contrast to delta C-13, the delta N-15 of individual feed
   types differed very strongly between - and also within - farms. Only
   legume seeds had relatively constant delta N-15 (1.2 +/- 0.5 parts per
   thousand). delta N-15 of cow hair was correlated with stocking rate
   (r(2) = 0.55) and N input surplus (farm gate) (r(2) = 0.78),
   respectively. This correlation was probably caused by increasing losses
   of N-15-depleted N via ammonia volatilisation, nitrate leaching and
   denitrification with increasing farm-level N surplus. Heterogeneity of
   feed N-15 signatures indicated within-farm heterogeneity of N fluxes and
   cycling that was at (least partially) integrated in cattle hair. Thus,
   cattle hair N-15 signature appears to indicate the `leakiness' of cattle
   production systems for N. Conversely, the C-13 signatures reliably
   indicates maize feeding and, thus, the type of land use (arable forage
   cropping versus grassland farming) on which cattle production in the
   region is based. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.agee.2005.01.015,"C-13; N-15; food traceability; environmental indicators; livestock

Many nuclear facilities, including power reactors, release 14C into the environment, and much of this is as 14CO2. This mixes readily with stable CO2, and hence enters the food chain as fundamental biomolecules. This isotopic mixing is often used as the basis for dose assessment models. The present model was developed for the situation of 14C releases to surface waters, where there are distinct changes in the water 14C activity concentrations throughout the year. Complete isotopic mixing (equilibrium) cannot be assumed. The model computes the specific activity (activity of 14C per mass of total C) in water, phytoplankton, fish, crops, meat, milk and air, following a typical irrigation-based food-chain scenario. For most of the biotic compartments, the specific activity is a function of the specific activity in the previous time step, the specific activity of the substrate media, and the C turnover rate in the tissue. The turnover rate is taken to include biochemical turnover, growth dilution and mortality, recognizing that it is turnover of C in the population, not a tissue or an individual, that is relevant. Attention is paid to the incorporation of 14C into the surface water biota and the loss of any remaining 14CO2 from the surface water-air interface under its own activity concentration gradient. For certain pathways, variants in the conceptual model are presented, in order to fully discuss the possibilities. As an example, a new model of the soil-to-plant specific activity relationship is proposed, where the degassing of both 14C and stable C from the soil is considered. Selection of parameter values to represent the turnover rates as modeled is important, and is dealt with in a companion paper.",S0265-931X(05)00292-4 [pii] and 10.1016/j.jenvrad.2005.10.007 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

   biological invasions, affecting the rivers food web structure. The
   Ponto-Caspian amphipods, Chelicorophium curvispinum and Dikerogammarus

   filterfeeding C. curvispinum dominated the Rhine food web on the stones
   in 1998, swamping the stone substrata with mud. However, in 2001 it
   decreased in numbers, most likely due to top-down regulation caused by
   increased parasitic and predatory pressure of other more recently
   invaded Ponto-Caspian species. D. villosus showed a fast population
   increase after its invasion and particularly influenced the
   macroinvertebrate community on the stones by predaceous omnivory. This
   species seemed to have maintained its predatory level after its
   population established. Effects of these mass invaders on the
   macroinvertebrate community of sandy streambeds in the Rhine are
   unclear. Here, low densities of macroinvertebrates were observed with
   the Asiatic clam, Corbicula fluminea, as most abundant species. Stable
   isotope values of food webs from the stones and sand in 2001 were

   fuelled by phytoplankton and particulate organic matter, originating
   from riparian vegetation as indicated by similar delta C-13 values.
   Omnivores, filter-, deposit-, and detritus-feeders are the primary and

   We employ stable isotope analyses of carbon (C-13/C-12, expressed as
   delta C-13) and nitrogen (N-15/N-14, delta N-15) in time-series of
   rockhopper penguin feather samples, dating back to 1861, in order to

   whether rockhopper penguin population decline has been associated with a
   shift towards lower primary productivity in the ecosystem in which they
   feed, or with a shift to a diet of lower trophic status and lower
   quality, and we use long-term temperature records to evaluate whether
   shifts in isotope ratios are associated with annual variations in sea
   surface temperature. Having controlled temporally for the Suess Effect

   decline of penguin populations. There was some evidence of a long-term
   decline in delta N-15 at some sites, and strong evidence that delta N-15
   signatures were negatively related to sea surface temperatures across
   sites, indicative of a shift in diet to prey of lower trophic status

   We investigated foodweb dynamics and trophic linkages to shortfin eels
   in Lake Ellesmere using a combination of abundance assessments, dietary
   studies, and stable isotope analyses. Data from our study are compared
   with historical data sets on benthic invertebrate community composition
   and shortfin eel diets to trace changes in the trophic linkages to top
   predators that have occurred since the late 1960s. Stable isotope
   analyses indicate that the foodweb is predominantly driven by epipelic
   and phytoplankton derived carbon sources, although it was difficult to
   discriminate between these two carbon pools because of wind-driven
   resuspension of lake sediments. Comparison of our survey results with
   historical data sets indicates a clear shift in benthic biota from being
   dominated by phytofaunal species such as Potamopyrgus antipodarum
   (comprising 90\% of total invertebrate biomass) during the 1960s, to now
   being almost entirely comprised of subterranean species such as
   Chironomus zealandicus and oligochaetes (together comprising 82\% of

   resulted in significant changes in the size-specific diet of juvenile
   shortfin eels (< 400 mm) from those reported for Lake Ellesmere during

   Mediterranean lagoons exhibiting contrasting degrees of eutrophication
   and marine influences were compared through delta C-13 and delta N-15
   analysis of major potential food sources and consumers. The Lapalme
   Lagoon is well preserved and has kept a natural and temporary connection
   with the open sea. Conversely, the Canet Lagoon is heavily eutrophicated
   and its water exchange with the open sea has been artificially reduced.
   In Lapalme, all potential food sources and consumers exhibited delta
   N-15 values indicative of pristine coastal areas. Suspended particulate
   organic matter (POM) and sediment organic matter (SOM) pools seemed to
   constitute the main food sources of most primary consumers. Both primary
   producers and all consumers were much more N-15-enriched (by similar to
   10 parts per thousand) and more C-13-depleted in Canet than in Lapalme.
   This reflected: (1) the assimilation of important amounts of
   anthropogenic nitrogen in the food web, and (2) a marked and uniform
   influence of C-13-depleted allochtonous sources of carbon. Based on the
   mean delta N-15 of primary consumers, we found rather similar food web
   lengths in both lagoons with top consumers at trophic levels 3.6 and 4.0
   in Canet and Lapalme, respectively. However, the eutrophication of the
   Canet Lagoon resulted in a simplification of the food web structure
   (i.e., a single trophic pathway from a N-15-enriched fraction of the SOM
   pool to top predators) compared to what was observed in Lapalme Lagoon
   where additional C-13-enriched food sources played a significant trophic
   role. Moreover, some consumers of Canet tended to exploit primary
   producers to a larger extent (and thus to exhibit lower trophic levels)
   than in Lapalme. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.seares.2008.10.006,"delta C-13; delta N-15; Food web; Lagoon; Eutrophication; Trophic

   years, we contrast hypotheses that biotic interactions versus physical
   environmental changes are primary drivers of evolutionary turnover in
   mammals. We use stable carbon (delta C-13) and oxygen (delta O-18)
   isotope ratios in tooth enamel carbonate to trace herbivore niche shifts
   through the Late Quaternary Land Mammal Ages (LMAs) of grassland
   savannas in the South African interior (Cornelian-1.0 to 0.6 Ma;
   Florisian-500 to 10 ka; and Holocene/modern). Data reveal niche
   separation amongst closely related coeval taxa, and dispersals through
   time into empty niche spaces following extinctions. This suggests a
   primary role of competitive exclusion and niche displacement for
   speciation and extinctions in these early grassland environments.
   However, niche changes through time show a similar trend in many taxa,
   entailing increased delta C-13 (elevated C-4 grass consumption) from the
   Cornelian to the Florisian, and from the Florisian to the
   Holocene/modern, and elevated delta O-18 in Holocene/modern taxa that

   Commonality in isotopic trends implies universal environmental forcing

   shift from a mixed C-3/C-4 diet in the Florisian to a near-pure C-3 diet
   today. Indeed, we find that while delta C-13 data are normally
   distributed for Cornelian fossils, non-normal distributions characterize
   more recent time intervals. Such distributions are in line with the
   bimodal distribution of delta C-13 and diet in contemporary African

Series B, Physical and biological sciences","In the past 20 years, rapid progress in stable isotope (SI) studies has allowed scientists to observe natural ecosystems from entirely new perspectives. This report addresses the fundamental concepts underlying the use of the SI ratio. The unique characteristics of the SI ratio make it an interdisciplinary parameter that acts as a chemical fingerprint of biogenic substances and provides a key to the world of isotopomers. Variations in SI ratios of biogenic substances depend on the isotopic compositions of reactants, the pathways and kinetic modes of reaction dynamics, and the physicochemical conditions. In fact, every biogenic material has its own isotopic composition, its ""dynamic SI fingerprint"", which is governed by its function and position in the material flow. For example, the relative SI ratio in biota is determined by dietary lifestyle, e.g., the modes of drinking, eating, and excreting, and appears highly regular due to the physicochemical differences of isotopomers. Our primary goal here is to elucidate the general principals of isotope partitioning in major biophilic elements in molecules, biogenic materials, and ecosystems (Wada, E. et al., 1995). To this end, the nitrogen and carbon SI distribution ratios (delta(15)N and delta(13)C, respectively) are used to examine materials cycling, food web structures, and their variability in various kinds of watershed-including aquatic ecosystems to elucidate an ""isotopically ordered world"".",JST.JSTAGE/pjab/85.98 [pii] and pjab-85-98 [pii] and 10.2183/pjab.85.98 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed growth rates and shell geochemistry of the circumpolar Greenland smooth cockle, Serripes groenlandicus, from the southern Barents Sea over almost 70 years between 1882 and 1968. The datasets were calibrated via annually-deposited growth lines, and growth, stable isotope (delta(18)O, delta(13)C), and trace elemental (Mg, Sr, Ba, Mn) patterns were linked to environmental variations on weekly to decadal scales. Standardized growth indices revealed an oscillatory growth pattern with a multi-year periodicity, which was inversely related to the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAO), and positively related to local river discharge. Up to 60% of the annual variability in Ba/Ca could be explained by variations in river discharge at the site closest to the rivers, but the relationship disappeared at a more distant location. Patterns of delta(18)O, delta(13)C, and Sr/Ca together provide evidence that bivalve growth ceases at elevated temperatures during the fall and recommences at the coldest temperatures in the early spring, with the implication that food, rather than temperature, is the primary driver of bivalve growth. The multi-proxy approach of combining the annually integrated information from the growth results and higher resolution geochemical results yielded a robust interpretation of biophysical coupling in the region over temporal and spatial scales. We thus demonstrate that sclerochronological proxies can be useful retrospective analytical tools for establishing a baseline of ecosystem variability in assessing potential combined impacts of climatic change and increasing commercial activities on Arctic communities.",S0025-326X(09)00093-9 [pii] and 10.1016/j.marpolbul.2009.02.022 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

   through alterations in the structure and function of its food webs.
   Insights into the nature of food web change and its ecological
   ramifications can be obtained through the monitoring of high trophic
   level predators such as aquatic birds. Often, food web change involves
   alterations in the relative abundance of constituent species and/or the
   introduction of new species (exotic invaders). Diet composition of
   aquatic birds is influenced, in part, by relative prey availability and
   therefore is a sensitive measure of food web structure. Using bird diet
   data to make inferences regarding food web change requires consistent
   measures of diet composition through time. This can be accomplished by
   measuring stable chemical and/or biochemical ecological tracers in
   archived avian samples. Such tracers provide insights into pathways of
   energy and nutrient transfer. In this study, we examine the utility of
   two groups of naturally-occurring intrinsic tracers (stable isotopes and
   fatty acids) to provide such information in a predatory seabird, the
   herring gull (Larus argentatus). Retrospective stable nitrogen and
   carbon isotope analysis of archived herring gull eggs identified
   declines in gull trophic position and shifts in food sources in Lake
   Huron over the last 25 years and changes in gull diet composition were

   ecological tracers provided corroborating evidence of dietary change in
   this high trophic level predator. Gull dietary shifts were related to
   declines in prey fish abundance which suggests large-scale alterations
   to the Lake Huron ecosystem. Dietary shifts in herring gulls may be
   contributing to reductions in resources available for egg formation.
   Further research is required to evaluate how changes in resource

   biomass in particular that of fungi as indicated by phospholipid fatty
   acids (PLFAs). Microbial PLFAs reflected the conversion from C(3) to
   C(4) plants by a shift in delta 13C of 2 parts per thousand, whereas the
   isotopic signal in fatty acids (FAs) of Collembola was much more
   pronounced. In the euedaphic Protaphorura fimata the delta 13C values in
   maize fields exceeded that in C(3) (soybean) fields by up to 10 parts
   per thousand, indicating a close relationship between diet and
   vegetation cover. In the epedaphic Orchesella villosa delta 13C values
   shifted by 4 parts per thousand, suggesting a wider food spectrum
   including carbon of former C(3) crop residues. Differences in delta 13C
   of corresponding FAs in consumers and resources were assessed to assign
   food web links. P. fimata was suggested as root and fungal feeder in
   soybean fields, fungal feeder in conventional and leaf consumer in
   organically managed maize fields. O. villosa likely fed on root and
   bacteria under soybean, and bacteria and fungi under maize. Comparison
   of delta 13C values in FAs of the cursorial spider Pardosa agrestis and
   O. villosa implied the latter as important prey species in soybean
   fields. In contrast, the web-building spider Mangora acalypha showed no
   predator-prey relationship with Collembola. The determination of delta
   13C values in trophic biomarker FAs allowed detailed insight into the
   structure of the decomposer food web and identified diet-shifts in both
   consumers at the base of the food web and in top predators in organic
   versus conventional agricultural systems. The results indicate changes
   in major trophic links and therefore carbon flux through the food web by
   conversion of conventional into organic farming systems.",10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.17587.x,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

   arthropods in a saltmarsh previously dominated by native Phragmites
   australis in Yangtze River estuary through net sweeping and plant
   harvesting methods and stable isotope analysis. Our results showed that
   diversity indices were not significantly different between exotic and
   native plant communities, but the total abundance of insects estimated
   through plant harvesting method was found to be lower in Spartina
   monoculture than that in Phragmites monoculture. Community structure of
   insects in Spartina monoculture was dissimilar to that in Phragmites
   monoculture and Phragmites-Spartina mixture. Moreover, stable carbon
   isotope patterns of arthropods were significantly different between
   Phragmites and Spartina monocultures. Although some native arthropods
   (perhaps generalists) shifted their diets, many native taxa did prefer
   Phragmites to Spartina even in Spartina monoculture. Spartina invasions
   resulted in reduced abundances of some arthropds, and increased
   dominance of others feeding preferably on Spartina. This study provides
   evidence that invasive plants can change the community structure and
   diets of native arthropods, which will eventually alter the arthropod
   food web, and affect the integrity and functioning of native ecosystems

   multi-trophic level responses at ocean basin scales",PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY,"Variation in life history traits of organisms is thought to reflect
   adaptations to environmental forcing occurring from bottom-up and
   top-down processes. Such variation occurs not only among, but also
   within species, indicating demographic plasticity in response to
   environmental conditions. From a broad literature review, we present
   evidence for ocean basin- and large marine ecosystem-scale variation in
   intra-specific life history traits, with similar responses occurring
   among trophic levels from relatively short-lived secondary producers to
   very long-lived apex predators. Between North Atlantic and North Pacific
   Ocean basins, for example, species in the Eastern Pacific exhibited
   either later maturation, lower fecundity, and/or greater annual survival
   than conspecifics in the Western Atlantic. Parallel variations in life
   histories among trophic levels also occur in adjacent seas and between
   eastern vs. western ocean boundaries. For example, zooplankton and
   seabird species in cooler Barents Sea waters exhibit lower fecundity or
   greater annual survival than conspecifics in the Northeast Atlantic. Sea
   turtles exhibit a larger size and a greater reproductive output in the
   Western Pacific vs. Eastern Pacific. These examples provide evidence for
   food-web-wide modifications in life history strategies in response to
   environmental forcing. We hypothesize that such dichotomies result from
   frequency and amplitude shifts in resource availability over varying
   temporal and spatial scales. We review data that supports three primary
   mechanisms by which environmental forcing affects life history
   strategies: (1) food-web structure; (2) climate variability affecting
   the quantity and seasonality of primary productivity; (3) bottom-up vs.
   top-down forcing. These proposed mechanisms provide a framework for
   comparisons of ecosystem function among oceanic regions (or regimes) and
   are essential in modeling ecosystem response to climate change, as well
   as for creating dynamic ecosystem-based marine conservation strategies.

   Moreover, ranges of basal resource delta(13)C and delta(15)N overlapped
   at both low and high sites, making discrimination between the importance

   on delta C-13 and delta N-15 of various planktonic and benthic taxa. For
   both isotopes, the average effect of fixation in ethanol was stronger

John F. Hoffecker,2009,Neanderthal and Modern Human Diet in Eastern Europe,Vertebr. Paleobiol. Paleoanthropol.,"The Late Pleistocene environments of Eastern Europe - especially the
   cool and dry environments of the East European Plain - offer a unique
   setting for comparison of Neanderthal and modern human diet. There are
   some taphonomic factors specific to this setting, however, including
   those related to the scarcity of natural shelters and distribution of
   woody plants on the central plain, which complicate the analysis of Late
   Pleistocene human diet. Neanderthals occupied southern upland areas, and
   sometimes the southwest and central plain, probably sustaining
   themselves primarily on the hunting of large mammals, which often
   included steppe species such as Bison priscus and Saiga tatarica. It is
   difficult to understand how recent hunter-gatherers in some of these
   environments (e.g., southwest plain during the Middle Pleniglacial)
   could have sustained themselves throughout the year on the basis of
   large mammal hunting without food storage. The key to Neanderthal
   survival in such habitats may have been the hunting of mammoth and
   rhinoceros - very large herbivores not available to recent
   hunter-gatherers in northern interior settings. Modern humans - who are
   present on the East European Plain as early as anywhere in Europe
   broadened the diet to include small mammals, birds, and/or fish during
   the Middle Pleniglacial. Evidence of this shift, which seems to have
   been achieved through the design of novel food-getting technologies, is
   derived both from the faunal remains and stable isotope analysis of
   human bone. Modern humans occupied the loess-steppe habitat on the
   central plain during the Late Pleniglacial and often used their food

   a similar diet through time (approximate to 120,000 to approximate to
   37,000 cal BP) and in different regions of Europe. The isotopic evidence
   indicates that in all cases Neanderthals were top-level carnivores and
   obtained all, or most, of their dietary protein from large herbivores.
   In contrast, early modern humans (approximate to 40,000 to approximate
   to 27,000 cal BP) exhibited a wider range of isotopic values, and a
   number of individuals had evidence for the consumption of aquatic
   (marine and freshwater) resources. This pattern includes Oase 1, the
   oldest directly dated modern human in Europe (approximate to 40,000 cal
   BP) with the highest nitrogen isotope value of all of the humans

   covers and observed dietary responses of Corophium spinicorne (amphipod)
   and Macoma balthica (bivalve) based on delta C-13 and delta N-15
   measurements in 2 estuarine tidal flats. Each of the tidal flats (MA and
   TE) was predominated by marine- or terrestrial-origin organic matter
   (OM), respectively. We hypothesised that the reduction of benthic
   microalgae correspondingly decreases the proportion of macrobenthos diet
   attributable to benthic microalgae, and enhances their assimilation of
   allochthonous OM. Our canopy treatment reduced chlorophyll a in the
   surface sediment by 35 to 40\%. While delta C-13 and delta N-15 of M
   balthica were not affected by the canopy treatment, the signatures of C.
   spinicorne were significantly altered at both sites. In MA, the canopy
   treatment reduced the nutritional dependence of C. spinicorne on benthic

   shallow lake food webs",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"P>1. Shallow lakes are often cited as classic examples of systems that
   exhibit trophic cascades but, whilst they provide good model systems
   with which to test general ecological theory and to assess long-term
   community change, their food web linkages have rarely been resolved, so
   changes associated with the structure and dynamics of the ecological
   network as a whole are still poorly understood.
   2. We sought to redress this, and to demonstrate the potential benefits
   of integrating palaeolimnological and contemporary data, by constructing
   highly resolved food webs and stable isotope derived measures of trophic
   interactions and niche space, for the extant communities of two shallow
   U.K. lakes from different positions along a gradient of eutrophication.
   The contemporary surface sediment cladoceran and submerged macrophyte
   assemblages in the less enriched site, Selbrigg Pond, matched the
   palaeolimnological assemblages of the more enriched site, Felbrigg Hall
   Lake, in its more pristine state during the 1920s. Thus, Selbrigg was a
   temporal analogue for Felbrigg, from which the consequences of long-term
   eutrophication on food web structure could be inferred. These data
   represent the first steps towards reconstructing not only past
   assemblages (i.e. nodes within a food web), but also past interactions
   (i.e. links within a food web): a significant departure from much of the
   previous research in palaeolimnology.
   3. The more eutrophic food web had far fewer nodes and links, and thus a
   less reticulate network, than was the case for the more pristine system.
   In isotopic terms, there was vertical compression in delta 15N range
   (NR) and subsequent increased overlap in isotopic niche space,
   indicating increased trophic redundancy within Felbrigg. This structural
   change, which was associated with a greater channelling of energy
   through a smaller number of nodes as alternative feeding pathways
   disappear, could lead to reduced dynamic stability, pushing the network
   towards further simplification. These changes reflected a general shift
   from a benthic-dominated towards a more pelagic system, as the
   plant-associated subweb eroded.
   4. Although these data are among the first of their kind, the
   palaeo-analogue approach used here demonstrates the huge potential for
   applying food web theory to understand how and why these ecological
   networks change during eutrophication. Furthermore, because of the rich
   biological record preserved in their sediments, shallow lakes represent
   potentially important models for examining long-term intergenerational
   dynamics, thereby providing a means by which models and data can be
   integrated on meaningful timescales - a goal that has long proved
   elusive in food web ecology.",10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02280.x,"ecological networks; eutrophication; macrophytes; palaeo-ecology; stable

   a major concern for conservation globally and has given rise to the
   multidisciplinary field of urban ecology. This field explores the direct
   and indirect effects of human activities on food-web dynamics, community
   structure, and animal behavior in highly modified urban ecosystems.
   Urban ecosystems are typically characterized by reduced species
   diversity but increased abundance of a few species able to exploit
   anthropogenic food sources. For many urban mammalian and avian species
   direct resource subsidization is difficult to assess using traditional
   means such as scat analysis. Here we show how stable isotope analysis
   can be used to assess the exploitation of anthropogenic foods in an
   endangered carnivore, the San Joaquin kit fox (Vuipes macrotis mutica)
   inhabiting the southern San Joaquin Valley in California. Examination of
   carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope data shows that
   kit foxes living in urban Bakersfield, California, extensively exploit
   anthropogenic foods, which sharply contrasts with dietary data derived
   from scat analysis. Urban kit foxes had significantly higher delta C-13
   and lower delta N-15 values than foxes from adjacent nonurban areas and
   had similar isotope values as Bakersfield human residents, which
   suggests a shared food source. In contrast, examination of isotopic data
   for nonurban kit foxes shows that they largely consume the most abundant
   natural prey species found in their scats. Stable isotope analysis
   offers a rapid and cost-effective means of evaluating the degree to
   which urban wildlife populations exploit anthropogenic foods in areas
   where native C-4 vegetation is relatively uncommon or absent, important
   in assessing the direct impacts of human activities on food-web dynamics

   and reproductive phenology is predicted to strongly influence freshwater
   fish community structure in some systems. Despite its potential
   importance, few long-term studies of reproductive phenology in river
   fishes have been conducted in a community context. Here, we evaluated
   timing and sequence of reproduction of fishes in the Rio Grande, New
   Mexico over 9 years. Dates and rank order of first appearance of larvae
   varied among species and years, but three consistent spawning guilds
   were evident: early season, late season, and species that were
   intermediate in rank order of spawning. We hypothesized that appropriate
   reproductive timing enhanced recruitment to the extent that spawning
   cues predicted future availability of critical resources for larvae.
   Analysis of historical discharge records indicated that present and
   future discharge exhibited positive auto correlation for up to 90 d.
   Likewise, larval fish densities were highest at moderate flows and
   coincident with high food resource abundance. However, stable isotope
   data for larval and adult fishes indicated considerable overlap in food
   resource use among larvae and adult fishes. There maybe pressure for
   spawning time to converge among species to match the appearance of
   seasonal resources, but to diverge to lessen competition among
   young-of-year fishes in a classical trade-off scenario. More long-term
   studies are needed, and we propose that an integrated research program
   that combines detailed analysis of reproductive phenology, food web
   dynamics, and comparative genomic analyses could forge connections
   between environmental variation in spawning cues, recruitment success,
   and community assembly in river fishes. Such an integrated program could
   lead to better predictions about fish community responses to global

   Nitrogen stable isotope ratios ranged from 6 parts per thousand to 14

   number of organisms located at intermediate trophic levels suggests a
   low level of omnivory in the Mingan Islands' system, which contrasts

   lakes by the end of the twenty-first century. To simulate this scenario,
   during 2004-2007 we imposed artificial mixing in Halsjarvi, a small,
   polyhumic, boreal lake in southern Finland, to increase the depth of the
   thermocline by similar to 1.5 m. The aims of the experiment were to
   evaluate potential effects of climate change on biogeochemical cycles,
   especially of mercury, and on food web structure, productivity and
   biodiversity in dystrophic lake ecosystems. Following the initial
   depression of the thermocline in the experimental lake, the methyl
   mercury (MeHg) concentration in small European perch (Perca fluviatlis
   L.) decreased and remained lower throughout the study. In contrast,
   perch in a nearby reference lake exhibited increased MeHg during the
   same period. The delta(15)N values of the muscle tissue of perch were
   similar in both lakes over the study period, suggesting that the trophic
   position of perch remained unchanged. However, delta(13)C values of
   perch became clearly more negative in Halsjarvi, probably due to the
   greater mixing of the water column that resulted in changes in the
   carbon sources for the food web. A marked decrease of epilimnetic MeHg
   concentrations recorded during the experiment was considered to be the
   main reason for the decreased MeHg concentrations in perch. The results
   suggest that oxygen-related changes induced by climate change will be

   in different canals within Xochimilco. There were significant isotopic
   differences among canals. These differences may result from isotopic
   baseline differences as well as differences in actual food web

   list of 100 of the world's worst invasive alien species. Introduced into
   Lake Naivasha (Kenya) in 1929, their current population abundance is
   significantly depressed in a lake that has recently become dominated by
   fishes of the Cyprinidae family; the introduced cyprinid Cyprinus carpio
   now dominates catches in the commercial fishery and Barbus paludinous is
   now numerically dominant in the fish community. Long-term diet studies
   of M. salmoides based on gut contents analysis (GCA) have defined their
   diet spectrum, feeding preferences and ontogenetic dietary shifts.
   Between 1987 and 1991, diet was size-structured; fish < 260 mm were
   mainly insectivorous and fish > 260 mm fed mainly on invasive crayfish
   Procambarus clarkia with B. paludinosus rarely taken. More recent GCA
   data revealed that up to 2003, these size-structured trophic
   relationships were still evident, but there has been a subsequent shift
   to their feeding almost exclusively on small (< 100 mm) B. paludinosus,
   coincident with a size-related functional switch whereby M. salmoides >
   120 mm were now piscivorous. However, a Bayesian stable isotope mixing

   varied in 2006 and 2007; it indicated P. clarkii were still contributing
   more to their diet than B. paludinosus in fish < 260 mm and provided
   only partial support for the functional shift. The consequence of the M.
   salmoides depressed population abundance is their predation pressure on
   prey fishes is limited and preventing top-down effects. This is in

   CARBON PROCESSING IN THREE AUSTRALIAN RIVERS",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Understanding longitudinal trends in the processing of carbon in rivers
   represents a much conceptualised, but infrequently tested, issue in
   aquatic ecology. In this study, we conducted concurrent longitudinal
   examinations of three very different rivers in eastern Australia to
   determine whether general principles in river functioning exist across
   broad geographic and hydrologic scales. Specifically, we examined trends
   in ambient basic water chemistry, nutrient concentrations, dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC), extracellular enzymes and food web structure and
   functioning and conducted bioassays to examine the degree to which DOC
   and nutrients limit heterotrophic bacterial respiration. These
   parameters revealed striking similarities across all sites. For metazoan
   communities, stable isotope analysis showed that algal carbon was the
   dominant basal resource utilised by consumers in all three rivers,
   suggesting that in-stream primary producers strongly underpin trophic
   pathways regardless of the position within a catchment or catchment
   condition. Analyses of extracellular enzymes revealed that microbial
   communities are actively utilising DOC at all sites. In fact,
   heterotrophic microbial respiration was strongly limited by DOC at all
   sites, with nutrient additions resulting in only relatively minor
   increases in respiration. Ultimately, this study demonstrates that DOC
   and algal carbon are critically important drivers of ecosystem processes
   in Australian riverine ecosystems. Furthermore, across all of our sites
   and rivers, ambient nutrient concentrations did not influence carbon
   processing. The consistent longitudinal trends in river function

   community was investigated at three reaches in the Kansas River, USA to
   determine if delta C-13 variability and delta N-15 values differ

   Fish and macroinvertebrates were collected at three river reaches in the
   Kansas River classified as the less urbanized reach (no urban in

   intermediate (14\% riparian zone as urban; 22\% grass islands and sand

   intermediate and urbanized reaches, suggesting fish from these reaches
   utilized a variety of carbon sources. The delta N-15 also indicated that
   omnivorous and detritivorous fish species tended to consume prey at

   physiology of two invasive herbs",JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,"P>1. Clonal plants benefit from the ability to translocate resources
   among interconnected ramets to colonize heterogeneous habitats. Clonal
   integration affects the resource level and morphological traits of
   ramets, and thus may influence their physiology and general performance.
   Although leaf gas exchange and its associated physiological adjustments
   are key traits to assess plant fitness, the effect of clonal integration
   on these functional traits is insufficiently understood.
   2. In a glasshouse experiment, we addressed how clonal integration
   affects gas exchange properties, leaf characters and growth of ramets in
   two invasive plants, Alternanthera philoxeroides and Phyla canescens,
   under full sun and 85\% shade. We also used stable-isotope labelling to
   assess the maternal subsidy to daughter ramets.
   3. Similar effects of connection were observed in both species for most
   gas exchange parameters and leaf characters. Clonal integration did not
   affect photosynthetic capacity and respiratory rates of ramets. When
   grown in shade, ramets connected with an unshaded mother plant displayed
   higher area-based leaf nitrogen and chlorophyll content than severed
   ramets, but the additional nitrogen and chlorophyll was not translated
   to increased photosynthetic capability. Overall, severed ramets
   displayed significant light response for leaf nitrogen (area-based),
   photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, chlorophyll to nitrogen ratio,
   and nitrogen stable-isotope signature, but the light response was
   eliminated by clonal integration in connected ramets.
   4. Both species displayed substantial maternal carbohydrate subsidy that
   benefited the growth of daughter ramets, but species-specific patterns
   were observed in the growth of daughter ramets and the amount of
   subsidy. The amount of subsidy was independent of ramet growth light
   levels for P. canescens, but shaded, connected ramets of A.
   philoxeroides received more subsidy than unshaded controls, facilitating
   a larger growth improvement relative to severed counterparts than P.
   canescens.
   5. Synthesis. We observed increased leaf nitrogen and chlorophyll in
   shaded, connected ramets of two clonal invasive plants. Clonal
   integration may facilitate nitrogen assimilation and allow
   pre-acclimation to high-light conditions for shaded, connected ramets,
   thus promoting the opportunistic expansion of these invaders on site
   scale. The species-specific maternal subsidy pattern demonstrated that
   clonal plants possess different strategies to subsidize ramets under

   the time since diet switches",FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,"P>1. Understanding ecological phenomena often requires an accurate
   assessment of the timing of events. To estimate the time since a diet
   shift in animals without knowledge on the isotope ratios of either the
   old or the new diet, isotope ratio measurements in two different tissues
   (e.g. blood plasma and blood cells) at a single point in time can be
   used. For this `isotopic-clock' principle, we present here a
   mathematical model that yields an analytical and easily calculated
   outcome.
   2. Compared with a previously published model, our model assumes the
   isotopic difference between the old and new diets to be constant if
   multiple measurements are taken on the same subject at different points
   in time. Furthermore, to estimate the time since diet switch, no
   knowledge of the isotopic signature of tissues under the old diet, but
   only under the new diet is required.
   3. The two models are compared using three calibration data sets
   including a novel one based on a diet shift experiment in a shorebird
   (red knot Calidris canutus); sensitivity analyses were conducted. The
   two models behaved differently and each may prove rather unsatisfactory
   depending on the system under investigation. A single-tissue model,
   requiring knowledge of both the old and new diets, generally behaved
   quite reliably.
   4. As blood (cells) and plasma are particularly useful tissues for
   isotopic-clock research, we trawled the literature on turnover rates in
   whole blood, cells and plasma. Unfortunately, turnover rate predictions
   using allometric relations are too unreliable to be used directly in
   isotopic-clock calculations.
   5. We advocate that before applying the isotopic-clock methodology, the

   England, more than 100 years ago, but relatively little is known of its
   potential ecological impacts on native species and ecosystems. In
   England, the pumpkinseed is currently established in ponds of the River
   Ouse (Sussex) and its flood plain. Escapee pumpkinseeds are found in
   some small tributaries that contain native species of conservation
   interest (brown trout Salmo trutta, brook lamprey Lampetra planeri,
   European eel Anguilla anguilla, European bullhead Cottus gobio). We used
   using electrofishing surveys and telemetry methods to examine the
   interactions between pumpkinseeds and native stream fishes (mainly brown
   trout), including predator prey relationships, home range size,
   microhabitat preferences, home range fidelity, and habitat
   overlap/repartition. To assess impacts of pumpkinseed on stream food
   webs, a preliminary study quantified trout growth and food-web structure
   of a stream ecosystem (abundance of primary and secondary producers,
   fish, and riparian spiders) in reaches with and without pumpkinseed.
   Where pumpkinseeds were in high density, differences were observed in
   stream food -web structure, in proportional representation of fish
   species traits and in riparian spider community composition, but these
   differences cannot be attributed solely to pumpkinseed presence. From
   the available evidence, there appears to be little direct or indirect
   adverse impact of pumpkinseed on native species and the stream ecosystem
   when in low densities, including as a host of nonnative infectious
   agents. However, this could change under conditions of climate warming,
   which are likely to favor pumpkinseed reproduction, potentially to the
   detriment of native species. In a context in which freshwater ecosystems

   community originated from two boreal lakes in southern Finland having
   similar total organic carbon (ca. 11 mg L-1) and total phosphorus (ca.

   activity mainly by biodegradable DOC in the high nitrogen lake water,
   and by nitrogen in the low nitrogen lake water, which was also reflected
   in total pelagic energy metabolism and zooplankton productivity. DOC
   additions caused changes in the bacterial community structure, shown by
   length heterogeneity analysis of the PCR amplified 16S rRNA gene

   to be a good tracer of DOC via bacteria to metazooplankton, especially
   in the nitrogen-limited conditions. Utilization of detrital particulate
   terrestrial organic matter by zooplankton was also evident, but it
   appeared to be a poor quality food. Our results show that an increased
   loading of allochthonous DOC to boreal lakes as predicted under future

   temperate lake ecosystem",OIKOS,"Although some primary consumers such as chironomid larvae are known to
   exploit methane-derived carbon via microbial consortia within aquatic
   food webs, few studies have traced the onward transfer of such carbon to
   their predators. The ruffe Gymnocephalus cernuus is a widespread
   benthivorous fish which feeds predominantly on chironomid larvae and is
   well adapted for foraging at lower depths than other percids. Therefore,
   any transfer of methanogenic carbon to higher trophic levels might be
   particularly evident in ruffe. We sampled ruffe and chironomid larvae
   from the littoral, sub-littoral and profundal areas of Jyvasjarvi,
   Finland, a lake which has previously been shown to contain chironomid
   larvae exhibiting the very low stable carbon isotope ratios indicative
   of methane exploitation. A combination of Fish gut content examination
   and stable isotope analysis was used to determine trophic linkages
   between Fish and their putative prey. Irrespective of the depth from
   which the ruffe were caught, their diet was dominated by chironomids and
   pupae although the proportions of taxa changed. Zooplankton made a
   negligible contribution to ruffe diet. A progressive decrease in delta
   C-13 and delta N-15 values with increasing water column depth was
   observed for both chironomid larvae and ruffe, but not for other species
   of benthivorous fish. Furthermore, ruffe feeding at greater depths were
   significantly larger than those feeding in the littoral, suggesting an
   ontogenetic shift in habitat use, rather than diet, as chironomids
   remained the predominant prey item. The outputs from isotope mixing
   models suggested that the incorporation of in ethane-derived carbon to
   larval chironomid biomass through feeding on methanotrophic bacteria
   increased at greater depth, varying from 0\% in the littoral to 28\% in
   the profundal. Using these outputs and the proportions of littoral,
   sub-littoral or profundal chironomids contributing to ruffe biomass, we
   estimated that 17\% of ruffe biomass in this lake was ultimately derived
   from chemoauotrophic sources. Methanogenic carbon thus supports

   compositions of 32 bulk and 368 serial tooth enamel samples from
   herbivores in the Linxia Basin (Gansu Province), ranging in age from 25
   Ma to the present, were determined. The results corroborate and improve
   the record previously obtained from the area, showing that all mammals
   in the Linxia Basin lived in habitats consisting primarily of C-3
   vegetation prior to 2-3 Ma and that C-4 grasses did not become a
   significant component of local ecosystems until the Quaternary. The data
   also show that shifts in climate to drier and/or warmer conditions after
   about 14, 9.5, 7, and 2.5 Ma, as indicated by positive delta O-18
   excursions in the bulk enamel-delta O-18 record, were accompanied by
   increased seasonality; whereas negative delta O-18 shifts in the bulk
   data after about 11, 6, and 1.2 Ma, which indicate shifts to wetter
   and/or cooler climate, were associated with decreases in seasonality.
   Intra-tooth delta C-13 and delta O-18 profiles reveal significant
   changes in the seasonal patterns of diet and climate after similar to
   2-3 Ma. Prior to similar to 2-3 Ma, there was little or no seasonal
   variation in herbivores diets and all herbivores fed on C-3 vegetation
   year around. After that time, the data show a significant seasonal
   variation in the diets of horses and bovids, ranging from a pure C-3 to
   a mixed C-3/C-4 diet (with C-4 plants accounting for up to similar to
   60\% of the diet). An inverse relationship (or negative correlation)

   species in acidified lakes. We studied four lakes along a gradient of
   recovery from acidification and that had different food web
   complexities. All had abundant yellow perch, two had low piscivore
   abundance, one had a well-established piscivore population and one was
   manipulated by introducing piscivorous smallmouth bass (Micropterus
   dolomieu). We hypothesised that there would be strong effects on perch
   abundance, behaviour and diet induced by the presence of piscivores.
   2. In the manipulated lake, the bass reduced yellow perch abundance by
   75\% over a 2-year period. Concomitantly, perch use of the pelagic
   habitat fell from 48 to 40\%.
   3. In contrast to findings from less disturbed systems, yellow perch in
   the littoral zone of the manipulated lake did not strongly shift from
   zooplankton to benthic food sources after the arrival of piscivores.
   Diet analysis using stable carbon isotopes revealed a strong continued
   reliance on zooplankton in all lakes, independent of the degree of
   piscivory. The failure to switch to benthos in the refuge area of the
   littoral zone is most likely related to the depauperate benthos
   communities in these formerly acidified lakes.
   4. Yellow perch in lakes recovering from acidification face a
   considerable ecological challenge as the necessary switch to benthic
   diet is hindered by a low abundance of benthos. The arrival of
   piscivores in these recovering lakes imposes further restrictions on
   perch access to food items. We infer that future recovery of perch

Here, we examined if ecological segregation among animals in relation to sex and age existed by analyzing the signatures of δ(15)N and δ(13)C in the muscle of Western Mediterranean striped dolphins. Moreover, we used a Bayesian mixing model to study diet composition and investigated potential dietary changes over the last two decades in this population. For this, we compared isotope signatures in samples of stranded dolphins obtained during two epizootic events occurring in 1990 and 2007-2008. Mean δ(13)C values for females and males were not significantly different, but age-related variation indicated δ(13)C enrichment in both sexes, suggesting that females and males most likely fed in the same general areas, increasing their consumption of benthic prey with age. Enrichment of δ(15)N was only observed in females, suggesting a preference for larger or higher trophic level prey than males, which could reflect different nutritional requirements. δ(13)C values showed no temporal variation, although the mean δ(15)N signature decreased from 1990 to 2007-2008, which could indicate a dietary shift in the striped dolphin over the last two decades. The results of SIAR indicated that in 1990, hake and sardine together contributed to 60% on the diet of immature striped dolphins, and close to 90% for mature striped dolphins. Conversely, the diet of both groups in 2007-2008 was more diverse, as hake and sardine contributed to less than 40% of the entire diet. These results suggest a dietary change that was possibly related to changes in food availability, which is consistent with the depletion of sardine stocks by fishing.",PONE-D-11-09094 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0024554 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

   established in each nursery area. These food webs were very sensitive to
   small variations in the freshwater input. Winter floods seem to disrupt
   the localized food webs that are established in low river flow periods,
   leading to the re-establishment of a wider food web. While in rainy
   years this wide food web is maintained until spring, in average years
   the food web undergoes fragmentation into two localized and isotopically

   of exchanges between ecosystems",ECOSCIENCE,"It is increasingly recognized that ecosystems are not closed systems and
   that exchanges of resources across ecosystem boundaries can have
   repercussions on food webs, especially in low productivity systems such
   as the terrestrial Arctic. However, because these exchanges can take
   multiple forms, assessing their significance in the functioning of the
   tundra food web is difficult. In this paper, we first review some
   important concepts related to resource exchanges between ecosystems and
   examine their relevance to the study of trophic interactions in the
   arctic tundra. An analysis of the Bylot Island food web in the Canadian
   Arctic using a mass-balance trophic model suggests that predators are
   the dominant force controlling this food web. However, an important
   feature of this ecosystem is that several top predators benefit from
   allochthonous inputs, either through the presence of migratory birds
   during the summer or the use of the marine environment as a foraging
   ground in winter. We also show that migratory birds may act as
   autochthonous resource exporters for lower trophic levels, for instance
   by removing nitrogen from the nutrient pool when young produced locally
   migrate south and die away from the system. Although these resource
   exchanges may be a general feature of several arctic terrestrial
   ecosystems, their importance in the functioning of the tundra food web
   remains to be determined. Through long-term monitoring, we found that
   primary production in wetlands of Bylot Island increased by 85\% over a
   20-y period, likely a consequence of the warming trend observed in the
   area. However, we have not detected any changes at higher trophic
   levels, which is consistent with a top-down control of this food web.

   dynamics of the tundra food web, a full investigation of the effects of

   unprecedented conditions have raised questions regarding the trophic
   functioning of the ecosystem. Despite the substantial amount of research
   previously undertaken within this system, no studies of food web
   structure and function have yet been documented. This study therefore
   aimed to examine the food web structure of the St. Lucia estuary system
   through the use of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis. Analysis
   of carbon isotope ratios indicates that benthic carbon sources are most
   utilised at sites with low water levels and generally higher salinity
   (Catalina Bay, Charter's Creek). Conversely, the estuarine region of the
   mouth and Narrows, with its elevated water levels and lower salinity,
   still sustains a viable pelagic food web. Analysis of delta N-15 ratios
   indicates that the number of trophic transfers (food chain length) might
   be related to water levels. Overall, the study provides a greater

   aquatic primary production. However, we know little about how
   allochthony, i.e., the proportion of consumer biomass derived from
   terrestrial organic matter, varies along environmental gradients. Using
   hydrogen isotopes (deuterium), we quantified allochthony of an
   ecologically dominant detritivorous fish species (gizzard shad, Dorosoma
   cepedianum) in reservoir ecosystems, along a gradient of watershed land
   use (agriculture vs. forest). We predicted that allochthony would
   decline with an increase in the proportion of watershed land composed of
   agriculture (\% agriculture). This is based on the supposition that as
   \% agriculture increases, so does the export of dissolved inorganic
   nutrients to lakes, stimulating algal production and reducing the
   importance of terrestrial organic carbon subsidies. Allochthony
   accounted for similar to 34\% of gizzard shad production (mean of 11
   lakes), although this fraction varied greatly (0-68\%) among lakes and
   isotope mixing model assumptions. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found
   no relationship between allochthony and \% agriculture. However,
   allochthony was inversely related to total watershed area, as well as
   the absolute area of the watershed (rather than the percentage) composed
   of agriculture. We speculate that watershed area and allochthony are
   negatively correlated because watershed area exerts a strong control on
   the relative subsidies of dissolved inorganic nutrients vs. particulate
   organic carbon. Gizzard shad biomass was positively related to
   phytoplankton primary production but negatively related to allochthony,
   suggesting that phytodetritus is a higher quality resource than
   terrestrial detritus. Overall, our results show that both autochthonous
   and allochthonous carbon fuel the production of this ecologically
   important detritivore, the relative importance of allochthony decreases

   The limpet isotopes had relatively broad ranges of delta C-13 and delta

   respectively), suggesting a dietary shift between habitats as well as
   size classes. The stable isotope ratios for each habitat seem likely to
   reflect the differing availabilities of the three potential food
   sources. Isotope mixing model results indicate a spatial shift in
   dietary mixture between habitats as well as limpet size classes.
   Epilithic microalgae and phytoplankton made great contributions to the
   diet of the subtidal limpets. Together with epilithic microalgae,
   macroalgae were significant contributors to the intertidal limpets where
   macroalgae were abundant. A higher contribution of macroalgae to the

   phytoplankton was an important food source for the limpet spat, a great
   dietary dependence on epilithic microalgae was found in the small-size

   grazing can determine microalgal and/or macroalgal abundance and

   ecological network analysis for quantitative measurement of food web
   dynamics",METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"1. Quantitative food web analysis is made difficult by the need for
   simultaneous measurement of multiple carbon (C) flows. C flow rates can
   potentially be quantified indirectly using conventional methods such as
   gut contents analysis, but the involvement of many conversion factors
   and assumptions results in significant errors in the final estimation.
   Such difficulties have limited quantitative data on food web dynamics,
   restricting community-level hypothesis testing.
   2. We conducted laboratory microcosm and field experiments, using
   combined enriched stable isotope ((13)C), compartmental modelling and
   ecological network analysis (ENA) as a novel approach to quantifying
   food web dynamics. Feasibility of this approach was demonstrated via the
   quantification of C flow, backflow and cycling in a subtropical
   estuarine sandflat food web comprising three trophic levels:
   microphytobenthos (MPB), three dominant meiofaunal groups (juvenile
   polychaetes, harpacticoid copepods and nematodes) and soldier crabs
   (Mictyris longicarpus).
   3. Enriched sodiumbicarbonate (NaH(13)CO(3)) was used to trace C flow.
   The compartmental modelling software WINSAAM quantified C flow by
   comparing the temporal patterns of producer and consumer (13)C
   enrichment. Network analysis software ECONET was used to assess food web
   dynamics by providing system indices that quantified the flows and food
   web interactions.
   4. This approach allows concurrent quantitative assessment of food web
   structure and ecosystem functioning. WINSAAM results showed that C
   return rate from nematodes to MPB was greater than the other two
   meiofaunal groups and soldier crabs assimilated more C from nematodes
   than from the other two meiofaunal groups. System indices from ECONET
   suggested that indirect flow contributed more than direct flow in this
   system. Unique capabilities of this approach in food web studies and
   assumptions underlying the proposed and conventional food web analytical
   approaches are discussed.
   5. Another significant advance of this approach is that it allows
   sensitive quantification of trophic linkages in a food web without
   requiring equilibrium to be achieved, thus enabling instantaneous
   assessment of the relative importance of various C flow pathways.
   Specific hypotheses about food web dynamics, such as the impact of
   eutrophication and urbanization, can then be tested quantitatively
   through manipulative experiments by comparing indices reflecting system

   and 203 faunal bone samples. The human materials represent Early
   Neolithic (8000-6800 cal BP), Late Neolithic (6000-5000 cal BP), and
   Early Bronze Age periods (similar to 5000-4000 cal BP) and come from the
   following four smaller areas of the broader region: the Angara and upper
   Lena valleys, Little Sea of Baikal's northwest coast, and southwest
   Baikal. Forager diets from each area occupy their own distinct position
   within the stable isotope spectrum. This suggests that foraging ranges
   were not as large as expected given the distances involved and the lack
   of geographic obstacles between the micro-regions. All examined
   individuals followed a similar subsistence strategy: harvesting game and
   local fishes, and on Lake Baikal also the seal, and to a more limited
   extent, plant foods. Although well established in their home areas,
   exchange networks with the other micro-regions appear asymmetrical both
   in time and direction: more travel and contacts between some
   micro-regions and less between others. The Angara valley seems to be the
   only area with the possibility of a temporal change in the foraging
   strategy from more fishing during the Early Neolithic to more ungulate
   hunting during the Late Neolithic-Early Bronze Age. However, the shift
   in stable isotope values suggesting this change can be viewed also as
   evidence of climate change affecting primary productivity of the
   Baikal-Angara freshwater system. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by

   benthic-demersal community off Phan Thiet Bay, Central Vietnam. Using
   cluster analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) of catch
   data from a trawl survey, we examined the nekton community structure
   pertaining to bottom substrate type and depth. For dominant fish and
   invertebrate taxa we applied stable isotope analysis, using delta N-15
   to examine trophic level (TL) and size-specific ontogenetic shifts, and
   delta C-13 as a measure of contribution by benthic secondary production.
   Based on trawl data small fishes and cephalopods were the numerically
   and biomass-dominant taxa. Community structure analysis showed many of
   the sample sites shared the same species composition, but that there was
   significant heterogeneity related to substrate types of sand and
   gravelly muddy sand. Results from delta N-15 showed 70\% of the species
   were between TL 3.3 and 3.8. with no species indicating true piscivory
   (TL 4); highest TL was from the squid Loligo japonica (TL 3.8).
   Size-specific delta N-15-based trophic shift was expressed in taxa when
   the proportional size range (Delta L-max) obtained for analysis was at
   least 40\% of the largest reported size for the species (L-max). From
   delta C-13, nekton expressed between 35 and 77\% dependence on benthic
   secondary production. Evidence of over-exploitation from our study
   included the relatively low TL's of dominant taxa, small size
   distribution of specimens collected, and the dominance of taxa with very
   high growth rates such as cephalopods (juvenile Octopus sp. and
   cuttlefish) and small fishes. The effectiveness of stable isotopes as an
   indicator of over-exploitation is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

   and organic matter. In this sense, fjord ecosystems are a typical
   interface and buffer zone between freshwater systems, glaciated
   continents, and the coastal ocean. In order to evaluate the potential
   sources and composition of organic matter across fjord ecosystems, we
   characterized particulate organic matter along a lake-river-fjord
   corridor in the Chilean Patagonia using stable isotope (delta C-13) and
   lipid (fatty acid composition) biomarker analyses. Furthermore,
   estimates of zooplankton carbon ingestion rates and measurements of
   delta C-13 and delta N-15 in zooplankton (copepods) were used to
   evaluate the implications of allochthonous subsidies for copepods
   inhabiting inner fjord areas. Our results showed that riverine
   freshwater flows contributed an important amount of dissolved silicon
   but, scarce nitrate and phosphate to the brackish surface layer of the
   fjord ecosystem. Isotopic signatures of particulate organic matter from
   lakes and rivers were distinct from their counterparts in oceanic
   influenced stations. Terrestrial allochthonous sources could support
   around 68-86\% of the particulate organic carbon in the river plume and
   glacier melting areas, whereas fatty acid concentrations were maximal in
   the surface waters of the Pascua and Baker river plumes. Estimates of
   carbon ingestion rates and delta C-13 in copepods from the river plume
   areas indicated that terrestrial carbon could account for a significant
   percentage of the copepod body carbon (20-50\%) during periods of food
   limitation. Particulate organic matter from the Pascua River showed a
   greater allochthonous contribution of terrigenous/vascular plant
   sources. Rivers may provide fjord ecosystems with allochthonous
   contributions from different sources because of the distinct vegetation
   coverage and land use along each river's watershed. These observations

   recolonization",RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,"Two high-head dams on the Elwha River in Washington State (USA) have
   changed the migratory patterns of resident and anadromous fish, limiting
   Pacific salmon to the lower 7.9km of a river that historically supported
   large Pacific salmon runs. To document the effects of the dams prior to
   their removal, we measured carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of
   primary producers, benthic macroinvertebrates, and fish, and water
   chemistry above, between and below the dams. We found that d15N was
   significantly higher in fish, stoneflies, black flies, periphyton and
   macroalgae where salmon still have access. Fish and chloroperlid
   stoneflies were enriched in d13C, but the values were more variable than
   in d15N. For some taxa, there were also differences between the two
   river sections that lack salmon, suggesting that factors other than
   marine-derived nutrients are structuring longitudinal isotopic profiles.
   Consistent with trophic theory, macroalgae had the lowest d15N, followed
   by periphyton, macroinvertebrates and fish, with a range of 6.9, 6.2 and
   7.7 parts per thousand below, between, and above the dams, respectively.
   Water chemistry analyses confirmed earlier reports that the river is
   oligotrophic. Phosphorous levels in the Elwha were lower than those
   found in other regional rivers, with significant differences among
   regulated, unregulated and reference sections. The removal of these
   dams, among the largest of such projects ever attempted, is expected to
   facilitate the return of salmon and their marine-derived nutrients (MDN)

   few decades of scientific observation, knowledge depends largely on
   proxy records derived from nitrogen stable isotopes (delta N-15)
   preserved in sediments and other bioarchives. Traditional bulk delta
   N-15 measurements, however, represent the combined influence of N source
   and subsequent trophic transfers, often confounding environmental

   acids (delta N-15-AA) has been shown as a means to deconvolve trophic
   level versus N source effects on the delta N-15 variability of bulk
   organic matter. Here, we demonstrate the first use of delta N-15-AA in a
   paleoceanographic study, through analysis of annually secreted growth
   rings preserved in the organic endoskeletons of deep-sea gorgonian
   corals. In the Northwest Atlantic off Nova Scotia, coral delta N-15 is
   correlated with increasing presence of subtropical versus subpolar slope
   waters over the twentieth century. By using the new delta N-15-AA
   approach to control for variable trophic processing, we are able to
   interpret coral bulk delta N-15 values as a proxy for nitrate source
   and, hence, slope water source partitioning. We conclude that the
   persistence of the warm, nutrient-rich regime since the early 1970s is
   largely unique in the context of the last approximately 1,800 yr. This
   evidence suggests that nutrient variability in this region is

   individuals moved among adjacent habitats in pursuit of higher-quality

   the continental slope of the Catalan Sea (Balearic basin, NW

   isotopes on a total of 34 species, and HPLC pigment analyses for three
   key species. Samples were collected close to Barcelona (NE Iberian
   Peninsula), between 650 and 800 m depth and between February 2007 and
   February 2008. Mean delta C-l3 values ranged from -21.0\%o (small
   Calocaris macandreae and Amphipholis squamata) to -14.5\% (Sipunculus
   norvegicus). Values of delta N-15 ranged from 4.0 parts per thousand (A.
   squamata) to 12.1 parts per thousand. (Molpadia musculus). The stable
   isotope ratios of benthic fauna displayed a continuum of values (e.g.
   delta N-15 range of 8 parts per thousand), confirming a wide spectrum of
   feeding strategies (from active suspension feeders to predators) and
   complex food webs. According to the available information on diets of
   benthic fauna, the lowest values were found for surface deposit feeders
   (small C. macandrae and the two ophiuroids A. squamata and Amphiura
   chiajei) and active suspension feeders (Abra longicallus and Scalpellum
   scalpellum) feeding on different sizes of particulate organic matter
   (POM), among which small particles may exhibit lower delta N-15. High
   annual mean delta N-15 values were found among sub-surface deposit
   feeders, exploiting refractory or frequently recycled organic matter
   that is enriched in delta N-15. Carnivorous polychaetes (Nephtys spp.,
   Oenonidae and Polynoidae) and large decapods (Geryon longipes and
   Paromola cuvieri) also displayed high delta N-15 values. delta C-13
   ranges were particularly wide among surface deposit feeders (ranging
   from -21.0 parts per thousand to -16.4 parts per thousand), suggesting
   exploitation of POM of both terrigenous and oceanic origins. Correlation
   between delta C-13 and delta N-15 was generally weak, indicating
   multiple carbon sources, likely due to the consumption of different
   kinds of sinking particles (e.g. marine snow, phytodetritus, etc.),
   sedimented and frequently recycled POM, together with macrophyte
   remains. The stronger delta C-13-6 delta(5N) correlations found in
   February and April suggest that during the period of water column
   homogeneization (winter-spring), the benthic community was sustained by
   phytodetritus inputs originating from the peak of surface primary
   production in February. Conversely, weaker delta C-13-delta N-15
   correlations were observed during the period of water column
   stratification (beginning in June-July), suggesting that the benthic
   community in this period was sustained, with a delay of ca. 2/3 months,
   by multiple carbon sources including continental inputs from river
   discharge (with the maxima in April-May). Thus both advective and
   vertical fluxes seem to be food sources for benthos on the Catalonian
   slope. Pigments in the guts of key species were generally degraded, and
   only the active suspension feeder A. longicallus ingested fresh
   chlorophyll during periods of high primary production at the surface

Interactions occurring among these invaders have important implications for ecosystem structure and functioning, yet they are poorly understood. Here we apply newly developed metrics derived from stable isotope data to provide quantitative measures of trophic diversity within populations or species. We then use these to test the hypothesis that sympatric invaders belonging to the same functional feeding group occupy a smaller isotopic niche than their allopatric counterparts. Two introduced, globally important, benthic omnivores, Louisiana swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and carp (Cyprinus carpio), are sympatric in Lake Naivasha, Kenya. We applied our metrics to an 8-year data set encompassing the establishment of carp in the lake. We found a strong asymmetric interaction between the two invasive populations, as indicated by inverse correlations between carp abundance and measures of crayfish trophic diversity. Lack of isotopic niche overlap between carp and crayfish in the majority of years indicated a predominantly indirect interaction. We suggest that carp-induced habitat alteration reduced the diversity of crayfish prey, resulting in a reduction in the dietary niche of crayfish. Stable isotopes provide an integrated signal of diet over space and time, offering an appropriate scale for the study of population niches, but few isotope studies have retained the often insightful information revealed by variability among individuals in isotope values. Our population metrics incorporate such variation, are robust to the vagaries of sample size and are a useful additional tool to reveal subtle dietary interactions among species. Although we have demonstrated their applicability specifically using a detailed temporal dataset of species invasion in a lake, they have a wide array of potential ecological applications.",PONE-D-11-22497 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0031757 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We combined information about pre- and postdreissenid abundance, biomass, and secondary production of the littoral benthos with results of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of archival (predreissenid) and recent (postdreissenid) samples of all common benthic taxa. This approach enabled us to determine the importance of benthic and sestonic carbon to the littoral food web before, and more than a decade after dreissenid establishment. Long term dreissenid presence was associated with a 32-fold increase in abundance, 6-fold increase in biomass, and 14-fold increase in secondary production of the littoral benthos. Dreissenids comprised a large portion of the post-invasion benthos, making up 13, 38, and 56% of total abundance, biomass, and secondary production, respectively. The predreissenid food web was supported primarily by benthic primary production, while sestonic material was relatively more important to the postdreissenid food web. The absolute importance of both sestonic material and benthic primary production to the littoral benthos increased considerably following dreissenid establishment. Our results show drastic alterations to food web structure and suggest that dreissenid mussels redirect energy and material from the water column to the littoral benthos both through biodeposition of sestonic material as well as stimulation of benthic primary production.",PONE-D-12-00457 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0051249 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We address this social-ecological need for Pacific salmon fisheries, which are economically valuable but intercept much of the annual pulse of nutrient subsidies that salmon provide to terrestrial and aquatic food webs. We used grizzly bears, vectors of salmon nutrients and animals with densities strongly coupled to salmon abundance, as surrogates for ""salmon ecosystem"" function. Combining salmon biomass and stock-recruitment data with stable isotope analysis, we assess potential tradeoffs between fishery yields and bear population densities for six sockeye salmon stocks in Bristol Bay, Alaska, and British Columbia (BC), Canada. For the coastal stocks, we find that both bear densities and fishery yields would increase substantially if ecosystem allocations of salmon increase from currently applied lower to upper goals and beyond. This aligning of benefits comes at a potential cost, however, with the possibility of forgoing harvests in low productivity years. In contrast, we detect acute tradeoffs between bear densities and fishery yields in interior stocks within the Fraser River, BC, where biomass from other salmon species is low. There, increasing salmon allocations to ecosystems would benefit threatened bear populations at the cost of reduced long-term yields. To resolve this conflict, we propose an EBFM goal that values fisheries and bears (and by extension, the ecosystem) equally. At such targets, ecosystem benefits are unexpectedly large compared with losses in fishery yields. To explore other management options, we generate tradeoff curves that provide stock-specific accounting of the expected loss to fishers and gain to bears as more salmon escape the fishery. Our approach, modified to suit multiple scenarios, provides a generalizable method to resolve conflicts over shared resources in other systems.",PBIOLOGY-D-11-04119 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001303 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differences between species along a productivity gradient.,PloS one,"Low productivity in aquatic ecosystems is associated with reduced individual growth of fish and increased concentrations of methylmercury (MeHg) in fish and their prey. However, many stream-dwelling fish species can use terrestrially-derived food resources, potentially subsidizing growth at low-productivity sites, and, because terrestrial resources have lower MeHg concentrations than aquatic resources, preventing an increase in diet-borne MeHg accumulation. We used a large-scale field study to evaluate relationships among terrestrial subsidy use, growth, and MeHg concentrations in two stream-dwelling fish species across an in-stream productivity gradient. We sampled young-of-the-year brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), potential competitors with similar foraging habits, from 20 study sites in streams in New Hampshire and Massachusetts that encompassed a wide range of aquatic prey biomass. Stable isotope analysis showed that brook trout used more terrestrial resources than Atlantic salmon. Over their first growing season, Atlantic salmon tended to grow larger than brook trout at sites with high aquatic prey biomass, but brook grew two-fold larger than Atlantic salmon at sites with low aquatic prey biomass. The MeHg concentrations of brook trout and Atlantic salmon were similar at sites with high aquatic prey biomass and the MeHg concentrations of both species increased at sites with low prey biomass and high MeHg in aquatic prey. However, brook trout had three-fold lower MeHg concentrations than Atlantic salmon at low-productivity, high-MeHg sites. These results suggest that differential use of terrestrial resource subsidies reversed the growth asymmetry between potential competitors across a productivity gradient and, for one species, moderated the effect of low in-stream productivity on MeHg accumulation.",PONE-D-12-17809 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0049582 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PRINCIPAL FINDING: Field investigation showed that P. japonica adults will search host plants for high prey abundance before laying eggs, indicating indirectly that P. japonica adults prefer to inhabit maize plants and travel to cotton plants to actively prey on aphids. The δ(13)C values of adult P. japonica in a dietary shift experiment found that individual beetles were shifting from a C(3)- to a C(4)-based diet of aphids reared on maize or cotton, respectively, and began to reflect the isotope ratio of their new C(4) resources within one week. Approximately 80-100% of the diet of P. japonica adults in maize originated from a C(3)-based resource in June, July and August, while approximately 80% of the diet originated from a C(4)-based resource in September. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Results suggest that maize can serve as a habitat or refuge source for the predatory beetle, P. japonica, and benefits predators to provide potential to enhance biological control for insect pests in cotton.",PONE-D-12-01217 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0044379 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tree masting is a common resource pulse in terrestrial ecosystems that can drive rodent population cycles. Using stable isotope (δ(13)C, δ(15)N) analyses, we investigated the dietary response of two fluctuating rodent species, the yellow-necked mouse Apodemus flavicollis and the bank vole Myodes glareolus, to mast events in Białowieża Forest (NE Poland). Rodent hair samples were obtained non-invasively from faeces of their predators for an 11-year period that encompassed two mast events. Spectacular seed crops of deciduous trees, namely oak Quercus robur and hornbeam Carpinus betulus, occur after several intermediate years of moderate seed production, with a post-mast year characterised by a nil crop. While a Bayesian isotopic (SIAR) mixing model showed a variety of potential vegetation inputs to rodent diets, the isotopic niche of the yellow-necked mouse was strongly associated with mast of deciduous trees (>80% of diet), showing no variation among years of different seed crop. However, bank voles showed a strong functional response; in mast years the vole shifted its diet from herbs in deciduous forest (~66% of diet) to mast (~74%). Only in mast years did the isotopic niche of both rodent species overlap. Previous research showed that bank voles, subordinate and more generalist than mice, showed higher fluctuations in numbers in response to masting. This study provides unique data on the functional response of key pulse consumers in forest food webs, and contributes to our understanding of rodent population fluctuations and the mechanisms governing pulse-consumer interactions.",PONE-D-12-25502 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0051267 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We expected a heavy reliance upon a diet of detrital matter to sustain the population as a consequence, and indeed, for the majority of the crayfish population caught from the lake, we saw a concomitant shift in isotopic values reflecting a dietary change. However, we also caught individual crayfish that had occupied the footprints of hippopotamus and effectively extended their range beyond the lake up to 40 m into the riparian zone. Isotopic analysis confirmed limited nocturnal observations that these individuals were consuming living terrestrial plants in the vicinity of the footprints.

   provide key insights into trophic structure and sources of nutrients.
   Trophic relationships are influenced by primary productivity
   (bottom-up), harvest and predation (top-down), and other factors such as
   invasive species. Increased nutrient loading to Lake Winnipeg has led to
   signs of eutrophication, while introduced rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax)
   now comprise a significant proportion of the diet of some commercial
   fish species. Our objective was to establish current delta C-13 and
   delta N-15 isotopic baselines for fishes in Lake Winnipeg in order to
   describe fish community structure and identify dietary nutrient sources.
   The North Basin food web was depleted in N-15 and enriched in C-13 over
   the South Basin. Smelt did not differ isotopically from other forage
   fish, while smelt-consuming walleye in the North Basin were more
   enriched in N-15 over South Basin walleye. This suggests that either
   smelt differ nutritionally from native forage species resulting in a
   higher diet-walleye delta N-15 discrimination factor, or that South
   Basin walleye feed more on zooplankton. Strong correlations between fish
   tissue isotope values and those of dissolved inorganic carbon (delta
   C-13-DIC) and nitrate (delta N-15-NO3) revealed that inorganic spatial
   patterns in each basin label the base of the food web isotopically.

   long-term changes due to eutrophication and invasive species in Lake

   strongly influenced by anthropogenic inputs of nutrients as well as

   concentrations, and biomagnification of mercury in two embayments in
   northern Lake Victoria that differ in their connectivity to the open
   lake, trophic status, and the influence of local anthropogenic
   pollution. Murchison Bay is a semi-confined hypereutrophic bay in a
   densely populated region, while Napoleon Gulf is mesotrophic and is well
   flushed with water from the open lake. Based on stable carbon and
   nitrogen isotope analysis, food web structure was similar at both sites,
   with short food chains and conspecific fish occupying similar trophic
   positions. However, there were strong differences in net phytoplankton
   delta N-15 and delta C-13 between sites: net phytoplankton delta C-13
   was largely related to trophic status, while delta N-15 values appeared
   to be influenced by inputs of human waste and the prevalence of
   biological nitrogen fixation. Total mercury (THg) concentrations in fish
   were consistently below 200 ng/g wet weight, and despite elevated THg
   concentrations in water in Murchison Bay, THg concentrations in net
   phytoplankton and fish from both embayments did not differ, highlighting
   that THg in water is not always a good predictor of concentrations in
   fish. We also observed that biomagnification of mercury was occurring at
   a lower rate in Murchison Bay than in Napoleon Gulf, and we propose that

   utilized a combination of estuarine, terrestrial, and marine POM during

   (Sagitta bierii and Sagitta euneritica), drawing on the CalCOFI

   on three different time scales: interannual (dominated by ENSO),
   decadal, and multi-decadal. Three of four species showed evidence of an
   ENSO-related isotopic shift toward increased N-15 during El Nino

   shallow (2-5 m) estuarine lagoons, fed by streams and small rivers that
   drain northward from the Brooks Range through the arctic coastal plain,
   and bounded seaward by barrier islands and shoals. Millions of birds
   from six continents nest and forage during the summer period in this
   region using the river deltas, lagoons, and shoreline along with several
   species of anadromous and marine fish. We examined biogeochemical
   processes linking the benthic community to the overall food web
   structure of these poorly studied but pristine estuaries, which are
   largely covered by 1.8 m of ice for 10 months annually. In summer, these
   lagoons are relatively warm with brackish salinities (5-10A degrees C, S

   The stable isotopic composition of organic materials in sediments (i.e.,
   benthic particulate organic matter) and water column suspended
   particulate organic matter from both streams and lagoons are largely
   indistinguishable and reflect strong terrestrial contributions, based
   upon delta C-13 and delta N-15 values (-25.6aEuro degrees to -27.4aEuro
   degrees and 1.4aEuro degrees to 3.3aEuro degrees, respectively). By

   fauna is consistent with a food web dominated by omnivorous detritovores
   strongly dependent on microbial processing of terrestrial sources of

   Fish River, Sundays River and Glen Melville Dam. Stomach content
   analysis indicated a catholic diet dominated by fish particularly in all
   localities. Spatially, however, the diets revealed differences based on
   the dominance of macrophytes that were only present in the rivers, and
   aquatic invertebrates that appeared more diverse within the Great Fish
   River compared to other localities. By contrast, stable isotopes
   revealed a more generalised feeding pattern with no clear dominance of
   particular prey. Stable isotopes further showed that the catfish was a

   size groups appeared to feed lower in the food chain. An ontogenetic
   shift in diet was evident, with small fish predominantly consuming

   Total catch, species richness, diversity and coefficient of community

   PME, whereas sewage-exposed assemblages had intermediate richness and
   diversity relative to reference sites. Stable isotope analysis of d13C

   positions in the presence of both effluents and showed shifts towards
   increased reliance on littoral-derived and benthic-derived carbon at
   sites downstream of the PME discharge. Fishes at PME-influenced sites
   had also generally higher condition factor whereas fishes at
   STP-influenced sites were more variable in condition factor. These
   differences may, in part, be due to decreased species diversity at these

   Aphids in Cotton",PLOS ONE,"Background: Biological control provided by natural enemies play an
   important role in integrated pest management. Generalist insect
   predators provide an important biological service in the regulation of
   agricultural insect pests. Our goal is to understand the explicit
   process of oviposition preference, habitat selection and feeding
   behavior of predators in farmland ecosystem consisting of multiple
   crops, which is central to devising and delivering an integrated pest
   management program.
   Methodology: The hypotheses was that maize can serve as habitat for
   natural enemies and benefits predators to provide potential to enhance
   biological control for pest insects in cotton. This explicit process of
   a predatory beetle, Propylea japonica, in agricultural ecosystem
   composed of cotton and maize were examined by field investigation and
   stable carbon isotope analysis during 2008-2010.
   Principal Finding: Field investigation showed that P. japonica adults
   will search host plants for high prey abundance before laying eggs,
   indicating indirectly that P. japonica adults prefer to inhabit maize
   plants and travel to cotton plants to actively prey on aphids. The delta
   C-13 values of adult P. japonica in a dietary shift experiment found
   that individual beetles were shifting from a C-3- to a C-4-based diet of
   aphids reared on maize or cotton, respectively, and began to reflect the

   80-100\% of the diet of P. japonica adults in maize originated from a

   Atlantic Islands: understanding past marine resource use",RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY,"RATIONALE Carbon (d13C) and nitrogen (d15N) analysis has been
   extensively used to investigate the importance of marine foods in the
   diet of archaeological populations in the North Atlantic Islands;
   however, few faunal studies exist to aid the interpretation of results.
   Palaeoenvironmental modelling of d13C and d15N values is crucial in
   determining whether changes in the stable isotope values are a result of
   dietary change, rather than temporal or geographical fluctuations in
   carbon and nitrogen. Investigating faunal dietary behaviour can provide
   an insight into past foddering and land management strategies. METHODS
   Detailed sampling of wild and domestic species for bulk collagen
   analysis was undertaken in order to characterise geographical variations
   in d13C and d15N values in the Outer Hebrides and Orkney. Samples from
   the Neolithic to the Norse period were analysed to assess temporal and
   geographical variations in d13C and d15N values, in addition to
   determining the contribution of marine foods to the diet of local fauna.
   RESULTS A d15N shift of 1 parts per thousand was observed between the
   Outer Hebrides and Orkney in the Neolithic and Iron Age. A geographical
   variation in d13C values was observed in the Norse period between Orkney
   and the Outer Hebrides. Temporal fluctuations in d13C and d15N values
   demonstrate variations in foddering practices of sheep in the Outer
   Hebrides. Pig specimens from the Outer Hebrides demonstrated evidence of
   marine food consumption in the Iron Age. CONCLUSIONS Faunal dietary

The bulk of past work has been conducted on large herbivorous mammals. One important finding is that their dietary habits of fossil large mammals track the late Miocene ecological shift from C3 forest and woodland to C4 savannah. However, few studies on carbon isotopes of fossil small mammals exist due to limitations imposed by the size of rodent teeth, and the isotopic ecological and dietary behaviors of small mammals to climate change remain unknown. Here we evaluate the impact of ecological change on small mammals by fine-scale comparisons of carbon isotope ratios (δ(13)C) with dental morphology of murine rodents, spanning 13.8 to ∼2.0 Ma, across the C3 to C4 vegetation shift in the Miocene Siwalik sequence of Pakistan. We applied in-situ laser ablation GC-IRMS to lower first molars and measured two grazing indices on upper first molars. Murine rodents yield a distinct, but related, record of past ecological conditions from large herbivorous mammals, reflecting available foods in their much smaller home ranges. In general, larger murine species show more positive δ(13)C values and have higher grazing indices than smaller species inhabiting the same area at any given age. Two clades of murine rodents experienced different rates of morphological change. In the faster-evolving clade, the timing and trend of morphological innovations are closely tied to consumption of C4 diet during the vegetation shift. This study provides quantitative evidence of linkages among diet, niche partitioning, and dental morphology at a more detailed level than previously possible.",PONE-D-13-08098 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0069308 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rivers presented low to moderate water mercury concentrations (from 1.25 ng L(-1) to 2.96 ng L(-1)) and natural differences in terms of sediment load. Mercury biomagnification rates were confronted to trophic structure depicted by carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes composition (δ(15)N; δ(13)C) of primary trophic sources, invertebrates and fishes. Results showed a slight fish contamination in the Iténez River compared to the unperturbed rivers, with higher mercury concentrations in piscivore species (0.15 µg g(-1) vs. 0.11 µg g(-1) in the unperturbed rivers) and a higher biomagnification rate. Trophic structure analysis showed that the higher biomagnification rate in the Iténez River could not be attributed to a longer food chain. Nevertheless, it revealed for the Iténez River a higher contribution of periphyton to the diet of the primary consumers fish species; and more negative δ(13)C values for primary trophic sources, invertebrates and fishes that could indicate a higher contribution of methanotrophic bacteria.

Carbon stable isotope ratios (δ(13)C) discriminate best between the two rivers, but fine scale analysis in otoliths requires rare, expensive instrumentation. We therefore correlated other tracers (SrSr, Ba, and Se in ratio to Ca) to δ(13)C that are easier to quantify in otoliths with other microchemical techniques. Although the Little Colorado River's water chemistry varies with major storm events, at base flow or near base flow (conditions occurring 84% of the time in our study) its chemistry differs sufficiently from the mainstem to discriminate one from the other. Additionally, when fish egress from the natal Little Colorado River to the mainstem, they encounter cold water which causes the otolith daily growth increments to decrease in size markedly. Combining otolith growth increment analysis and microchemistry permitted estimation of size and age at first egress; size at first birthday was also estimated. Emigrants < 1 year old averaged 51.2 ± 4.4 (SE) days and 35.5 ± 3.6 mm at egress; older fish that had recruited to the population averaged 100 ± 7.8 days old and 51.0 ± 2.2 mm at egress, suggesting that larger, older emigrants recruit better. Back-calculated size at age 1 was unimodal and large (78.2 ± 3.3 mm) in Little Colorado caught fish but was bimodally distributed in Colorado mainstem caught fish (49.9 ± 3.6 and 79 ± 4.9 mm) suggesting that humpback chub can also rear in the mainstem.

This study analyzed phenotype-environment correlations in a fish invasion from initial absence until establishment in the headwater reach of the second largest European river, the Danube. Here, the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) formed 73% of the fish abundance and 58% of the fish biomass in rip-rap bank habitats after establishment. The time from invasion until establishment was only about two years, indicating rapid expansion. Founder populations from the invasion front were different from longer established round goby populations in demography, morphology, feeding behaviour, sex ratio and parasitic load, indicating that plasticity in these traits determines invasion success. Competitive ability was mostly dependent on growth/size-related traits rather than on fecundity. As revealed by stable isotope analyses, specimens at the invasion front had a higher trophic position in the food web and seem to benefit from lower food competition. Somatic performance seems to be more important than investment in reproduction during the early stages of the invasion process and upstream-directed range expansion is not caused by out-migrating weak or juvenile individuals that were forced to leave high density areas due to high competition. This mechanism might be true for downstream introductions via drift. Greater abundance and densities of acanthocephalan endoparasites were observed at the invasion front, which contradicts the expectation that invasion success is determined by lower parasitic pressure in newly invaded areas. Overall, the pronounced changes in fish and invertebrate communities with a dominance of alien species suggest invasional meltdown and a shift of the upper Danube River towards a novel ecosystem with species that have greater resistance to goby predation. This seems to contribute to overcoming biological resistance and improve rapidity of dispersal.",PONE-D-13-13858 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0073036 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

   and altitudes in response to climate change. These range shifts are
   expected to change fish community structure and alter food-web dynamics
   in subarctic lakes. However, the impacts of invading species on native
   fish and invertebrate prey communities remain understudied. The trophic
   ecology of invasive species determines the likelihood of direct resource
   competition with native taxa. In Northern Europe, perch (Perca
   fluviatilis), a trophic generalist, and ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus), a
   benthic specialist, are expanding their distribution ranges northwards,
   colonising lakes inhabited by a native generalist, whitefish (Coregonus
   lavaretus). We predicted that increased fish diversity and density would
   deplete the invertebrate community and increase resource competition
   between native and invasive species. To assess the degree of resource
   competition between native and invasive species, we compared (i) fish
   and invertebrate community structure; (ii) diet and stable carbon and
   nitrogen ratios of whitefish, ruffe and perch and (iii) growth,
   condition and relative population size of whitefish in two non-invaded
   lakes with two lakes containing one and two lakes containing both
   invasive species. Each lake was sampled on a single occasion between
   August and September. Benthic macroinvertebrate density and community
   structure were unaffected by increased consumer diversity, while
   top-down control of pelagic zooplankton density and size was evident in
   lakes with increased fish diversity. Differences in diet and stable
   isotope ratios were evident between all whitefish populations, although
   these were not directly related to the presence of invasive species.
   Specialised adaptations of invasive species may confer a competitive
   advantage in invaded lakes; ruffe dominated the profundal niche, while
   perch displayed an ontogenetic shift to piscivory, reducing niche
   overlap with native whitefish. Growth rate and population density of
   whitefish were largely independent of fish community structure and were
   governed by local variations in lake productivity. However, there was a
   sign of lowered condition of whitefish in invaded systems. Shallow and
   more productive lakes with higher food availability supported
   populations of native and invasive species. Our findings indicate that
   trophic specialisations of invasive species play a key role in
   determining their impacts on the systems they invade. This study
   focussed on early stages of invasion, and the outcome of species
   interactions may change following the establishment of new species. In

   for stability",MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,"There is little doubt that Arctic ecosystems will continue to face
   unprecedented change in the coming decades. The identification of food
   web structures that confer stability to these systems is, therefore, a
   priority. Here, we use stable isotopes and fatty acids to resolve the
   food web structure of a seasonally ice-covered fjord (Cumberland Sound,
   Baffin Island, Canada) sampled in late summer. We show that the food web
   is structured such that upper trophic levels couple separate energy
   channels (based on phytoplankton or macroalgae), a previously documented
   food web structure that has been linked with stability in temperate
   ecosystems, but never established in a seasonally dynamic, ice-covered
   ecosystem. Herbivorous zooplankton (e.g. Calanus hyperboreus) relied
   exclusively on phytoplankton, whereas herbivorous benthos used either
   phytodetritus (e.g. Hiatella arctica) or macroalgae (e.g. Tectura
   testudinalis), supporting the existence of separate energy channels.
   Upper trophic level fishes and marine mammals relied more heavily on
   phytoplankton-than macroalgal-derived carbon (58 to 100\% reliance on
   phytoplankton), but 6 out of 8 species sampled derived energy from both
   carbon sources. Since benthic invertebrate predators used both
   phytodetrital- and macrolgal-based resources, the coupling of separate
   energy channels was also iterated within the benthos. The temporally
   pulsed nature of phytoplankton production, characteristic of Arctic
   seas, indicates that Arctic consumers also act as couplers of resources
   in time because phytoplankton-and detrital-based carbon would likely
   reach upper trophic levels earlier and later in the season,

   degrees of latitude and 18 000 km of coastline. To test this theory, we
   developed a food web model using stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta
   N-15) for the high-latitude Vestfold Hills shallow-water benthic
   community and compared it to the isotopic food web model developed for
   the Windmill Islands, located over 1000 km away. For the Vestfold Hills
   food web, carbon sources were generally well separated by delta C-13,
   and lower-order consumers could be grouped according to their feeding
   guild and main dietary sources as determined by delta C-13 and delta
   N-15. Higher-order consumers occupied the full range of delta C-13
   ratios and had similar delta N-15 values, although predators were
   weakly, but significantly, enriched in delta N-15 compared to
   scavenger/predators and omnivores. When comparing with the Windmill

   MELANOSTOMUS</i> (ACTINOPTERYGII: PERCIFORMES: GOBIIDAE), AND ITS
   TROPHIC ROLE IN THE CURONIAN LAGOON, SE BALTIC SEA",ACTA ICHTHYOLOGICA ET PISCATORIA,"Background. The round goby, Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas, 1814), is a
   recent invader in the Curonian Lagoon, SE Baltic Sea. As invasive
   species are among the most severe threats for biodiversity loss and can
   induce food web alterations, the development of round goby population in
   the Curonian Lagoon and its possible impacts on fish community and the
   entire ecosystem are of great scientific interest. This research reports
   on the expansion and trophic role of round goby in the Curonian Lagoon.
   Materials and methods. Occurrence and abundance of round goby was
   investigated using a beach seine and gill nets at the northern and
   central parts of the Curonian Lagoon during a six-year period from 2007
   to 2012. The trophic niche of the newcomer was revealed by applying gut
   content and stable isotope analyses (SIA). A total of 61 samples of
   other fish species were taken for SIA in order to reveal with which
   resident fish species the exploitative competition could be expected.
   Stable isotope mixing models were used to evaluate the contribution of
   round goby to the nutrition of top predators of the Curonian Lagoon:
   European perch, Perca fluviatilis Linnaeus, 1758; pike-perch, Sander
   lucioperca (Linnaeus, 1758); great cormorant, Phalacrocorax carbo; and
   grey heron, Ardea cinerea.
   Results. The survey showed that round goby expanded its distribution
   area and recently occurs in the entire Lithuanian part of the Curonian
   Lagoon. Variation in the density of round goby suggests that the
   invader's abundance may be stabilised in the northern part of the
   lagoon. Gut content and stable isotope analyses showed round goby being
   mainly benthivorous. The largest trophic overlap with respect to SIA was
   detected between the invader and ruffe, Gymnocephalus cernua (Linnaeus,
   1758), the fish which presumably exploits the same habitat type.
   According to stable isotope mixing models round goby was included with
   considerable shares into the diet of top predators.
   Conclusion. The further expansion of round goby inside the Curonian
   Lagoon is ongoing. However, there is evidence on population density
   stabilisation in the northern part of the lagoon. Native benthivorous
   fish, especially ruffe, may be affected through competition for food
   resources in habitats where the newcomer is numerous. Round goby
   significantly contributes to the diet of piscivorous fish and birds.
   That may promote the regulation of invader population abundance in the
   lagoon.",10.3750/AIP2013.43.2.02,aquatic invasion; diet composition; stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

   is critical for understanding the causes and consequences of diversity.
   Food-chain length (FCL) is a product of the biotic interactions within a
   community and the environment, but how environmental variation affects
   FCL is not well understood. We examined how gradients of ecosystem size
   and environmental variation in hydroperiod affected the FCL of ponds.
   Using C and N stable isotopes, we found that average FCL was 3.3 and
   varied by 3 trophic levels across ponds and years. We showed that ponds
   with shorter hydroperiods have shorter food chains, and that FCL is not
   strongly influenced by ecosystem size. These results demonstrate support
   for the dynamic constraints hypothesis, which states that
   less-predictable environments should have shorter food chains. Our data
   are not consistent with the prediction of the ecosystem size hypothesis
   that larger ecosystems have longer food chains. Insect and amphibian
   richness increased with increasing pond size and hydroperiod, results
   indicating that insertion of new species into the pond communities is a
   driving mechanism causing variation in FCL. Omnivory could explain
   variation in FCL, but our results show that the incidence of omnivory

   benthic (submerged macrophytes and associated epiphytes, benthic
   macro-invertebrates) and nektonic (fish) food-web components, collected
   from 3 to 7 shallow inshore locations (with additional plankton samples

   months. The resulting delta C-13 values did not indicate significant
   consumption of zooplankton by fish, while the delta N-15 values for fish
   confirmed their wide trophic separation from zooplankton. Instead, SI
   values indicated that fish relied mostly on food resources of benthic
   origin (through direct consumption or piscivory). The SI signatures of
   individual fish species were consistent with their known feeding habits.
   The lack of trophic couplings between zooplankton and fish accords with
   previous gut content analyses of fish and analyses of zooplankton
   abundance and size structure in hypertrophic reservoirs. Marginal
   utilisation of zooplankton by indigenous reservoir fish is attributable
   to their native origin as riverine species unaccustomed to feeding on

   use). 2.To determine the importance of the environmental context in
   modifying the uptake and incorporation of salmon-derived material into
   stream biota, we measured the nitrogen (15N) and carbon (13C) isotopic
   composition of benthic algae (i.e. epilithon) and juvenile coho salmon
   (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in seven streams across a timber-harvest gradient
   (869\% catchment area harvested), both before and during the salmon run.
   Conditional bootstrap modelling simulations were used to assess
   variability in the response of epilithon and juvenile coho salmon to
   spawning salmon. 3.In response to spawning salmon, epilithon exhibited
   enrichment in both 15N (mean: 1.5 parts per thousand) and 13C (2.3 parts

   models indicate decreased variation in data as spatial replication
   increases, suggesting that the number of study sites can influence the

   in catfish distribution and abundance, and compared trophic niches in
   relation to the ichthyofauna of the two rivers. Correspondence analysis
   revealed upstream to downstream gradients associated with the spatial
   distribution in species richness for most species within the mainstream
   and mainstream to tributary gradients that were associated mostly with
   the spatial distribution of native minnows in both rivers. Catfish was
   predicted to occur widely within the mainstream habitats and to decrease
   progressively from mainstreams to tributaries. Based on classification
   and regression trees, the physico-chemical environment was found to be a
   good proxy for predicting the occurrence and abundance of catfish.
   Although non-significant relationships were observed between catfish and
   other native fish species abundances, the study suggests potential
   impact due to predation and interference in habitats where the invader
   co-occurs with other fishes. Comparisons of trophic niches indicated
   higher trophic diversity for the mainstream ichthyofauna than the
   tributary communities in both rivers, suggesting an upstream to
   downstream continuum in community structure and resource availability.
   Catfish within the invaded mainstream had comparable trophic niches and
   similar dispersion patterns among individuals for both rivers, but
   indicated differences in shapes of scatter. This suggests that the
   catfish exhibited a differential response, probably in relation to
   resource availability, that may be indicative of its dietary plasticity.
   The study suggests the proliferation of catfish and its probable impact
   within the mainstream flow-altered habitats where invasion resistance
   was possibly reduced. Comparisons of trophic niches provided information
   on its probable impact at different scales and the potential risk of

   dioxide to the atmosphere that are globally significant. Carbon exported

   photosynthesis in aquatic ecosystems (autochthonous), contributing to
   the organic matter (OM) that supports aquatic consumers. Although the
   presence of terrestrial compounds in aquatic OM is well known, the
   contribution of terrestrial versus aquatic sources to the composition of
   OM has been quantified for only a handful of systems. Here we use stable

   lakes of the northern highlands region of Wisconsin and Michigan.
   Further, the largest carbon pool, dissolved organic matter (DOM), is
   strongly dominated by allochthonous material (mean for the same set of

   terrestrial contribution to POM are significantly correlated with more
   acidic pH. Extrapolating this relationship using a survey of pH in 1692

   consequences of climate change",DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY,"Southern Ocean squid are important predators and prey and are a
   potential fishery resource. Their future under climate change is
   analysed from predictions of change by 2100 and assessments of the
   effects on squid biology. There are similar to 18 Antarctic species of
   squid. Young feed primarily on crustaceans and switch later to fishes.
   They are preyed on by odontocetes, seals and seabirds - which together
   consume similar to 34 x 10(6) t yr(-1) - and fish. As predators, squid
   are second to fish as biomass producers but recent evidence suggests
   predator consumption of squid needs to be reassessed. Fatty acid
   composition and stable nitrogen isotope ratios indicate some predators
   consume less squid in their diet than gut contents data suggest.
   Southern Ocean oceanography is unique in having circumpolar circulation
   and frontal systems and at high latitudes it is heavily influenced by
   sea ice. The Antarctic Peninsula is among the fastest warming regions
   worldwide but elsewhere the Southern Ocean is warming more slowly and
   the Ross Sea is probably cooling. Sea ice is receding in the Peninsula
   region and increasing elsewhere. Modelled predictions for 2100 suggest
   although the Southern Ocean will warm less than other oceans and sea ice
   will reduce. The Antarctic Circumpolar Current may shift slightly
   southwards with intensification of westerly winds but resolution of the
   models is insufficient to predict mesoscale change. Globally, pH of
   seawater has decreased by 0.1 units since the mid-1900s and is predicted
   to decrease by another 0.5 units by 2100. Impact on calcifying organisms
   will be high in the cold Southern Ocean where solubility of calcium
   carbonate is high. Predicted temperature increases are unlikely to have
   major effects on squid other than changes in distribution near the
   limits of their range; acidification may have greater impact. Small
   changes in large scale circulation are unlikely to affect squid but
   changes in mesoscale oceanography may have high impact. Change in sea
   ice extent may not have a direct effect but consequent ecosystem changes
   could have a major impact. Cephalopods are ecological opportunists

Matt J. O'Callaghan and David M. Hannah and Ian Boomer and Mike Williams and Jon P. Sadler,2013,"Responses to River Inundation Pressures Control Prey Selection of
   Riparian Beetles",PLOS ONE,"Background: Riparian habitats are subjected to frequent inundation
   (flooding) and are characterised by food webs that exhibit variability
   in aquatic/terrestrial subsidies across the ecotone. The strength of
   this subsidy in active riparian floodplains is thought to underpin local
   biodiversity. Terrestrial invertebrates dominate the fauna, exhibiting
   traits that allow exploitation of variable aquatic subsidies while
   reducing inundation pressures, leading to inter-species micro-spatial
   positioning. The effect these strategies have on prey selection is not
   known. This study hypothesised that plasticity in prey choice from
   either aquatic or terrestrial sources is an important trait linked to
   inundation tolerance and avoidance.
   Method/Principal Findings: We used hydrological, isotopic and habitat
   analyses to investigate the diet of riparian Coleoptera in relation to
   inundation risk and relative spatial positioning in the floodplain. The
   study examined patch scale and longitudinal changes in utilisation of
   the aquatic subsidy according to species traits. Prey sourced from
   terrestrial or emerging/stranded aquatic invertebrates varied in
   relation to traits for inundation avoidance or tolerance strategies.
   Traits that favoured rapid dispersal corresponded with highest
   proportions of aquatic prey, with behavioural traits further predicting
   uptake. Less able dispersers showed minimal use of aquatic subsidy and
   switched to a terrestrial diet under moderate inundation pressures. All
   trait groups showed a seasonal shift in diet towards terrestrial prey in
   the early spring. Prey selection became exaggerated towards aquatic prey
   in downstream samples.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest that partitioning of
   resources and habitat creates overlapping niches that increase the
   processing of external subsidies in riparian habitats. By demonstrating
   functional complexity, this work advances understanding of floodplain
   ecosystem processes and highlights the importance of hydrological
   variability. With an increasing interest in reconnecting rivers to their
   floodplains, these invertebrates represent a key functional element in
   ensuring that such reconnections have demonstrable ecological value.",10.1371/journal.pone.0061866,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For laboratory-raised and wild-collected plant-invertebrate food chains spanning four trophic levels we estimated nitrogen range (NR) using δ(15)N, and carbon range (CR) using δ(13)C, which are used to quantify food chain length and breadth of trophic resources respectively. Across a range of known food chain lengths we examined how NR and CR changed within and between food chains. Our isotopic estimates of structure are robust because they were calculated using resampling procedures that propagate variance in sample means through to quantified uncertainty in final estimates. To identify origins of uncertainty in estimates of NR and CR, we additionally examined variation in discrimination (which is change in δ(15)N or δ(13)C from source to consumer) between trophic levels and among food chains. δ(15)N discrimination showed significant enrichment, while variation in enrichment was species and system specific, ranged broadly (1.4‰ to 3.3‰), and importantly, propagated variation to subsequent estimates of NR. However, NR proved robust to such variation and distinguished food chain length well, though some overlap between longer food chains infers a need for awareness of such limitations. δ(13)C discrimination was inconsistent; generally no change or small significant enrichment was observed. Consequently, estimates of CR changed little with increasing food chain length, showing the potential utility of δ(13)C as a tracer of energy pathways. This study serves as a robust test of isotopic quantification of food chain structure, and given global estimates of aquatic food chains approximate four trophic levels while many food chains include invertebrates, our use of four trophic level plant-invertebrate food chains makes our findings relevant for a majority of ecological systems.",PONE-D-13-35964 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0093281 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although this is expected to modify the structure of food webs, we have a relatively poor understanding of the potential consequences of such alteration. Here, we take advantage of a collection of ancient consumer tissues, using stable isotope analysis and SIBER to assess changes in the structure of coastal marine food webs in the South-western Atlantic through the second half of the Holocene as a result of the sequential exploitation of marine resources by hunter-gatherers, western sealers and modern fishermen. Samples were collected from shell middens and museums. Shells of both modern and archaeological intertidal herbivorous molluscs were used to reconstruct changes in the stable isotopic baseline, while modern and archaeological bones of the South American sea lion Otaria flavescens, South American fur seal Arctocephalus australis and Magellanic penguin Spheniscus magellanicus were used to analyse changes in the structure of the community of top predators. We found that ancient food webs were shorter, more redundant and more overlapping than current ones, both in northern-central Patagonia and southern Patagonia. These surprising results may be best explained by the huge impact of western sealing on pinnipeds during the fur trade period, rather than the impact of fishing on fish populations. As a consequence, the populations of pinnipeds at the end of the sealing period were likely well below the ecosystem's carrying capacity, which resulted in a release of intraspecific competition and a shift towards larger and higher trophic level prey. This in turn led to longer and less overlapping food webs.",PONE-D-14-18942 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0103132 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Land-use such as forestry activities in the Canadian Boreal region have increased in the last decades, raising concerns about their potential impact on aquatic ecosystems. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of forest harvesting on trophic structure in eastern Canadian Boreal Shield lakes. We measured carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes values for aquatic primary producers, terrestrial detritus, benthic macroinvertebrates, zooplankton and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) over a three-year period in eight eastern Boreal Shield lakes. Four lakes were studied before, one and two years after forest harvesting (perturbed lakes) and compared with four undisturbed reference lakes (unperturbed lakes) sampled at the same time. Stable isotope mixing models showed leaf-litter to be the main food source for benthic primary consumers in both perturbed and unperturbed lakes, suggesting no logging impact on allochthonous subsidies to the littoral food web. Brook trout derived their food mainly from benthic predatory macroinvertebrates in unperturbed lakes. However, in perturbed lakes one year after harvesting, zooplankton appeared to be the main contributor to brook trout diet. This change in brook trout diet was mitigated two years after harvesting. Size-related diet shift were also observed for brook trout, indicating a diet shift related to size. Our study suggests that carbon from terrestrial habitat may be a significant contribution to the food web of oligotrophic Canadian Boreal Shield lakes. Forest harvesting did not have an impact on the diet of benthic primary consumers. On the other hand, brook trout diet composition was affected by logging with greater zooplankton contribution in perturbed lakes, possibly induced by darker-colored environment in these lakes one year after logging.",PONE-D-13-42036 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0096143 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The trophic position of seals from Macquarie Island (54°30'S, 158°57'E) was estimated using stable carbon (δ(1) (3)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) ratios along the length of the whisker, which provided a temporal record of prey intake.

This is consistent with the consumption of euphausiids and most probably, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), which constitute an abundant, easily accessible source of prey in water masses used by this age class of seals.

During the first hours after pulse labelling, the measured isotopic signal of soil CO(2) efflux is a combination of both physical tracer diffusion into and out of the soil as well as biological tracer release via root and microbial respiration. Neglecting physical back-diffusion can lead to misinterpretation regarding time lags between photosynthesis and soil CO(2) efflux in grassland or any ecosystem type where the above-ground plant parts cannot be labelled in gas-tight chambers separated from the soil. We studied the effects of physical (13)CO(2) tracer back-diffusion in pulse labelling experiments in grassland, focusing on the isotopic signature of soil CO(2) efflux. Having accounted for back-diffusion, the estimated time lag for first tracer appearance in soil CO(2) efflux changed from 0 to 1.81±0.56 h (mean±SD) and the time lag for maximum tracer appearance from 2.67±0.39 to 9.63±3.32 h (mean±SD). Thus, time lags were considerably longer when physical tracer diffusion was considered. Using these time lags after accounting for physical back-diffusion, high nocturnal soil CO(2) efflux rates could be related to daytime rates of gross primary productivity (R(2)=0.84). Moreover, pronounced diurnal patterns in the δ(13)C of soil CO(2) efflux were found during the decline of the tracer over 3 weeks. Possible mechanisms include diurnal changes in the relative contributions of autotrophic and heterotrophic soil respiration as well as their respective δ(13)C values.

The total (15)N recoveries were similar under the ((15)NH4)2SO4 tracer treatment in both two forest ecosystems, whereas the total (15)N recovery was significantly lower in the subtropical forest ecosystem at DHS than in the boreal forest ecosystem at DXAL under the K(15)NO3 tracer treatment.

   habitat coupled by mobile consumers that behave in response to local
   environmental conditions. Despite this fundamental characteristic of

   overlooked (i) that climate warming will generally affect habitats
   differently and (ii) that mobile consumers may respond to this
   differential change in a manner that may fundamentally alter the energy
   pathways that sustain ecosystems. This reasoning suggests a powerful,
   but largely unexplored, avenue for studying the impacts of climate
   change on ecosystem functioning. Here, we use lake ecosystems to show
   that predictable behavioral adjustments to local temperature
   differentials govern a fundamental structural shift across 54 food webs.
   Data show that the trophic pathways from basal resources to a
   cold-adapted predator shift toward greater reliance on a cold-water
   refuge habitat, and food chain length increases, as air temperatures
   rise. Notably, cold-adapted predator behavior may substantially drive
   this decoupling effect across the climatic range in our study
   independent of warmer-adapted species responses (for example, changes in
   near-shore species abundance and predator absence). Such modifications
   reflect a flexible food web architecture that requires more attention

   often linked by resource fluxes and riparian vegetation is commonly
   affected by anthropogenic alterations to land use or river hydrological
   regime. I investigated whether shrubs at the freshwater-terrestrial
   interface alter the supply, distribution and importance of aquatic prey
   resources to terrestrial consumers. Shrubs were predicted to alter the
   larval community composition of aquatic insects and the emergence of
   winged adults, thus affecting aquatic prey subsidies to terrestrial
   consumers. In addition, shrubs were hypothesized to alter the
   microclimatic suitability of the riparian zone for adult aquatic
   insects, act as a physical barrier to their dispersal and affect
   terrestrial community composition, particularly the abundance and type
   of predators that could benefit from the aquatic prey resource. Stable
   isotope dietary analyses and a survey of shrub-dominated and open
   grassland riparian habitats revealed that larval densities of aquatic
   insects (EPTM: Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Megaloptera)
   were higher in shrub than grassland habitats; however, reduced emergence
   and lateral dispersal in shrub areas led to lower densities of adults.
   The temperature and relative humidity of the riparian zone did not

   communities had a higher proportion of cursorial spiders in grassland,

   contribution to cursorial spider diet matched adult aquatic insect
   abundances. Overall, riparian shrubs reduced the magnitude, or at least

   herring Clupea pallasii, a migratory, iteroparous forage fish that
   spawns along the coastlines of the North Pacific Ocean, has never been
   studied. Spawn events represent large aggregations of biomass and
   energy, a portion of which is transferred to intertidal and supratidal
   zones. Using fatty acids and stable isotopic signatures of carbon and
   nitrogen, we (1) traced the sources of production and (2) tested the
   hypothesis that herring subsidizes detritivorous, semi-terrestrial
   amphipods (Talitridae: Traskorchestia spp.), which are often abundant in
   intertidal and supratidal zones. Amphipods and likely dietary items
   (macrophytes and herring eggs) were collected from 5 beaches before and
   after herring spawned in Quatsino Sound, British Columbia. Combined with
   the use of mixing models, stable isotopes suggest that herring, in
   addition to brown algae and seagrass, were major sources of production
   during the study period. Fatty acid results suggest that brown algae is
   generally a major dietary resource for amphipods, but herring eggs
   provide important omega-3 fatty acids that are low in abundance prior to
   herring spawn events. Taken together, we provide corroborative evidence
   of a previously unknown cross-ecosystem spatial subsidy by Pacific

   feeding interactions across populations. Although the soil ecosystem
   provides important functions for aboveground ecosystems, data on complex
   soil food webs is notoriously scarce, most likely due to the difficulty
   of sampling and characterizing the system. To fill this gap we assembled
   the complex food webs of 48 forest soil communities. The food webs
   comprise 89 to 168 taxa and 729 to 3344 feeding interactions. The
   feeding links were established by combining several molecular methods
   (stable isotope, fatty acid and molecular gut content analyses) with
   feeding trials and literature data. First, we addressed whether soil
   food webs (n = 48) differ significantly from those of other ecosystem
   types (aquatic and terrestrial aboveground, n = 77) by comparing 22 food
   web parameters. We found that our soil food webs are characterized by
   many omnivorous and cannibalistic species, more trophic chains and
   intraguild-predation motifs than other food webs and high average and
   maximum trophic levels. Despite this, we also found that soil food webs
   have a similar connectance as other ecosystems, but interestingly a
   higher link density and clustering coefficient. These differences in
   network structure to other ecosystem types may be a result of ecosystem
   specific constraints on hunting and feeding characteristics of the
   species that emerge as network parameters at the food-web level. In a
   second analysis of land-use effects, we found significant but only small
   differences of soil food web structure between different beech and
   coniferous forest types, which may be explained by generally strong
   selection effects of the soil that are independent of human land use.

   freshwater fish overwinter survival and dispersal, potentially with
   strong implications for macroinvertebrate assemblage composition and
   ecosystem processes. Several studies worldwide have shown large effects
   of top predators (usually fish) on macroinvertebrates in streams.
   However, the influence of top predators on trophic diversity, the range
   of food resources exploited and trophic niche redundancy is less well
   studied, particularly in cold regions.
   2. Using stable isotopes (C-13 and N-15) and fish gut content analysis,
   we investigated the effect of top predators on macroinvertebrate food
   webs in streams in Greenland by comparing adjacent sites with and
   without fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus).
   3. Food-web metrics estimated from stable isotope data showed that the
   presence of fish reduced the diversity of food sources exploited by
   macroinvertebrates as well as their trophic diversity. In addition, fish
   presence increased packing and trophic redundancy of macroinvertebrate
   taxa in the food web, possibly due to behavioural changes in foraging
   activity. Furthermore, predatory macroinvertebrate taxa were unable to
   attain the trophic position of fish so that food webs were one trophic
   level longer in streams with fish. Focusing on macroinvertebrate food
   webs alone, predatory macroinvertebrates did not change their trophic
   position in the presence of fish.
   4. Filter feeders dominated the macroinvertebrate assemblage when fish
   were present, while the relative abundance of collector-gatherers was
   marginally higher in the fishless streams. This pattern was consistent
   with stronger selectivity for collector-gatherers by fish.
   5. Climate-driven fish colonisation in currently fishless Greenland
   streams may induce a shift in macroinvertebrate food webs, with a
   reduction in both trophic diversity and the variety of food sources
   consumed. To some extent, this might counteract a change towards a
   broader use of food resources by macroinvertebrates that might otherwise
   be expected at higher temperatures. In addition, a shift in the
   macroinvertebrate assemblage towards dominance of filter feeders can be
   expected to promote an increase in periphyton biomass in streams with

   benthic food webs in Lake Ontario. Our focus is on the

   PMI-FA mass fractions were greater in organisms associated with benthic
   (e.g. round goby) versus pelagic (e.g. alewife) food webs.
   Double-crested cormorants that had recently consumed benthic prey fish,
   i.e. goby, had greater proportions of PMI-FAs in their blood plasma than
   birds which showed no signs of recent goby ingestion. We did not detect

   habitats beyond the importance of hydroperiod and vertebrate predators,
   especially regarding trophic structure. We used playa wetlands,
   ephemeral habitats common in arid to semi-arid regions, as our study
   ecosystem. We predicted that larger, more species-rich playas would have
   food webs with larger dimensions (longer food chains and more energy
   sources used), more variation (more niches filled) and more redundancy
   (niche overlap). We used geometric properties of stable C and N isotope
   biplots to explore: (i) what regulates trophic structure in ephemeral
   wetlands, (ii) the role of anthropogenic forces in altering factors
   controlling trophic structure and (iii) how trophic structure in
   ephemeral systems differs from that typical of permanent systems. We
   sampled aquatic animal food webs of 21 playa wetlands located mostly in
   the short-grass prairies of the Pawnee National Grassland in Colorado,
   U.S.A. Playas with higher insect diversity had more complex trophic
   structures than those dominated by large branchiopods (tadpole, clam and
   fairy shrimps). Insect diversity seemed dependent on length of the
   hydroperiod and time since filling, both of which are determined by
   playa depth. The key to understanding trophic structure in playas is an
   interaction between hydroperiod and the traits, lifespans and trophic
   niches of the species present. The trophic structure of naturally
   created playas was marginally more complex than artificial playas, and
   playas buffered by native vegetation were more likely to have food webs
   that included unique trophic strategies. Food webs of playas influenced
   by row crop agriculture had a broader selection of food sources. Playas
   grazed by cattle had food-web structures comparable to those in ungrazed
   playas, suggesting that playa biota may be adapted to large mammal
   disturbances. The trophic structure of ephemeral aquatic habitats may
   not respond to disturbance in the same way as permanent systems. Indeed,
   food chain length in a playa can actually increase as the ephemeral
   ecosystem approaches the end of its hydroperiod. Measures of ecosystem
   size need to include more than the two dimensions of surface area when
   being applied to general ecological theory. Food webs increase in

   techniques have brought into question whether such measurements
   adequately account for protistan trophic steps. Here, we use a two-stage
   chemostat system, with Dunaliella tertiolecta and Oxyrrhis marina as a

   that equids began to incorporate C-4 plants in their diets about 6.5
   million years ago as C-4 grasslands expanded. However, the ecological
   response of many other ungulates to this expansion is poorly documented.
   We use stable carbon isotopes in mammalian tooth enamel to test whether
   other ungulates adapted by incorporating C-4 vegetation in their diets.
   The openness of habitats before the expansion of C-4 grasslands is
   uncertain, with plant phytolith studies suggesting a patchy environment
   with open-habitat grasses and forest, and pollen and macrofloral studies
   suggesting more forested habitats. To address this problem we use a
   model that predicts carbon isotope values for tooth enamel for a variety
   of environments, based on values in modern plants. Carbon and oxygen
   isotopes were analyzed in medium to large herbivores from three late
   Miocene and three Pliocene local faunas comprising a total of 13 and 7
   genera, respectively, and 59 and 42 individuals. Results indicate that
   before the expansion of C-4 grasslands, taxa with high-crowned teeth
   were consuming predominantly C-3 vegetation. In contrast, by the late
   Pliocene most taxa studied were consuming a component of C-4 vegetation
   and only the peccary Platygonus sp. had a pure C-3 diet. C-4 consumption
   increased in the late Pliocene (similar to 3.0 Ma) Big Springs local
   fauna probably in response to increased C-4 biomass. Most landscapes in
   the late Miocene of Nebraska were open, such as woodland-savanna or C-3
   grassland, although low carbon values from the Pratt Slide local fauna
   suggest a denser, presumably forested area. This general pattern
   suggests an expansion of open-habitats no later than 12 Ma (early
   Clarendonian). Through the Miocene-Pliocene transition there was an
   overall shift to lower delta O-18 enamel values, which parallels the
   long-term decrease in global mean annual temperature inferred from the

   inferred from stable isotope and fatty acid analyses",MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,"The abyss of the Sea of Japan represents an example of an isolated
   deep-sea environment that contains mostly endemic fauna and has a
   complicated Quaternary history. To determine the trophic structure and
   sources supporting this abyssal benthic community, the carbon and
   nitrogen stable isotope ratios and fatty acid (FA) compositions of key
   invertebrate species and sedimentary organic matter (SOM) were analysed.
   Samples were collected at a range of depths from 2481 to 3666 m in the
   deep-water basin of the Sea of Japan in August 2010. Species of the most
   abundant invertebrates-including polychaetes, sea anemones, peracarid
   crustaceans, bivalves and brittle stars-showed similar delta N-15
   values, corresponding to relatively high and similar trophic positions.
   Analysis of FA trophic markers showed that all of these equally
   N-15-enriched omnivores, carnivores and scavenger species in the Sea of
   Japan abyssal environment fed mostly on sinking zooplankton animals. The
   resulting FA profiles of these species showed a high 18:1 omega 9/18:1
   omega 7 ratio, and the 22:6 omega 3 and 20:5 omega 3 polyunsaturated FAs
   were the most abundant FAs. Only one macrobenthic species, the
   filter-feeding Thyasira (Parathyasira) sp., had low 22:6 omega 3 and
   20:5 omega 3 FA proportions, but it exhibited significant levels of 18:2
   omega 6 and 16:1 omega 10 FAs characteristic of the SOM of the deep
   waters of the Sea of Japan. These data reveal the dominant role of
   descending zooplankton as a food resource for mega- and macrobenthos in
   this marginal deep-water environment. Despite the proximity of the
   productive shelf area, which exports plant residues to the deep-water
   basin of the Sea of Japan, we found no isotopic or FA indications of
   feeding on allochtonous detritus of seagrasses or macroalgae among
   abyssal consumers. Our data did not support cannibalism as a feeding
   mode of the abundant abyssal carnivorous polychaetes, as had previously
   been suggested. Different key invertebrate species of the Sea of Japan
   abyssal food web occupied similar trophic positions and fed
   predominantly on descended zooplankton. We suggest that the simple
   structure of the Sea of Japan abyssal food web, lacking abundant
   deposit-feeder food chains, is the result of the young evolutionary age
   of this community rather than the low availability of bottom detritus or
   the specific structure of the pelagic community that provides abundant

   Midwest is gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum; gizzard shad have been used
   to increase growth and condition of walleye Sander vitreus in many

   gizzard shad are experiencing a natural range expansion. While this
   expansion may be beneficial for top predators like walleye, mixed
   results exist on the effects of gizzard shad on other recreationally
   important fishes in these systems. Our objectives were to determine if
   annual growth, relative abundance, and condition of yellow perch, Perca

   2009 at densities higher than those which resulted in self-sustaining
   populations in other South Dakota reservoirs. Yellow perch and walleye

   (shad present) and 2010 (post-shad) in two glacial lakes stocked with
   adult gizzard shad and a reference lake (not stocked with shad). Our
   results suggest that at the densities documented in this study and in
   the time frame assessed, gizzard shad did not negatively impact yellow
   perch as total length at age was similar, condition remained high and
   zooplankton resources were likely not limiting. Walleye did consume
   gizzard shad when available and shad appeared to have a neutral or
   positive effect on walleye growth, relative abundance and condition in

Changes in an animal's isotopic values over time are generally assumed to indicate diet shifts or, less frequently, physiological changes. Although plant isotopic values are known to correlate with climatic seasonality, only a few studies restricted to aquatic environments have investigated whether temporal isotopic variation in consumers may also reflect environmental baselines through trophic propagation. We modeled the monthly variation in carbon and nitrogen isotope values in whole blood of four insectivorous bat species occupying different foraging niches in southern Spain. We found a common pattern of isotopic variation independent of feeding habits, with an overall change as large as or larger than one trophic step. Physiological changes related to reproduction or to fat deposition prior to hibernation had no effect on isotopic variation, but juvenile bats had higher δ13C and δ15N values than adults. Aridity was the factor that best explained isotopic variation: bat blood became enriched in both 13C and 15N after hotter and/or drier periods. Our study is the first to show that consumers in terrestrial ecosystems reflect seasonal environmental dynamics in their isotope values. We highlight the danger of misinterpreting stable isotope data when not accounting for seasonal isotopic baselines in food web studies. Understanding how environmental seasonality is integrated in animals' isotope values will be crucial for developing reliable methods to use stable isotopes as dietary tracers.",PONE-D-11-04290 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0117052 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Empirical data on the integration of ecosystem engineers and food webs is however largely lacking. This paper investigates the hypothesised link based on a field sampling approach of intertidal biogenic aggregations created by the ecosystem engineer Lanice conchilega (Polychaeta, Terebellidae). The aggregations are known to have a considerable impact on the physical and biogeochemical characteristics of their environment and subsequently on the abundance and biomass of primary food sources and the macrofaunal (i.e. the macro-, hyper- and epibenthos) community. Therefore, we hypothesise that L. conchilega aggregations affect the structure, stability and isotopic niche of the consumer assemblage of a soft-bottom intertidal food web. Primary food sources and the bentho-pelagic consumer assemblage of a L. conchilega aggregation and a control area were sampled on two soft-bottom intertidal areas along the French coast and analysed for their stable isotopes. Despite the structural impacts of the ecosystem engineer on the associated macrofaunal community, the presence of L. conchilega aggregations only has a minor effect on the food web structure of soft-bottom intertidal areas. The isotopic niche width of the consumer communities of the L. conchilega aggregations and control areas are highly similar, implying that consumer taxa do not shift their diet when feeding in a L. conchilega aggregation. Besides, species packing and hence trophic redundancy were not affected, pointing to an unaltered stability of the food web in the presence of L. conchilega.",PONE-D-15-25481 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0140857 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Amphibians play a critical role both as consumers and prey in aquatic communities and yet there is still little information on the trophic status of most amphibians. More importantly, little is known about the extent to which they can alter their trophic ecology in response to changing conditions. We experimentally investigated the effects of increased amphibian density, presence of intraguild competitors, and presence of native and invasive predators (either free or caged) on the trophic status of a Mediterranean amphibian guild, using stable isotopes. We observed variations in δ13C and δ15N isotopic values among amphibian species and treatments and differences in their food sources. Macrophytes were the most important food resource for spadefoot toad tadpoles (Pelobates cultripes) and relatively important for all anurans within the guild. High density and presence of P. cultripes tadpoles markedly reduced macrophyte biomass, forcing tadpoles to increase their feeding on detritus, algae and zooplankton, resulting in lower δ13C values. Native dytiscid predators only changed the isotopic signature of newts whereas invasive red swamp crayfish had an enormous impact on environmental conditions and greatly affected the isotopic values of amphibians. Crayfish forced tadpoles to increase detritus ingestion or other resources depleted in δ13C. We found that the opportunistic amphibian feeding was greatly conditioned by intra- and interspecific competition whereas non-consumptive predator effects were negligible. Determining the trophic plasticity of amphibians can help us understand natural and anthropogenic changes in aquatic ecosystems and assess amphibians' ability to adjust to different environmental conditions.",PONE-D-15-05287 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0130897 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two main trophic strategies for resource acquisition have been described: competition and opportunism. In the present study our objective was to identify the main trophic strategies of the non-native amphibian Discoglossus pictus and its potential trophic impact on the native amphibian Bufo calamita. We determine whether D. pictus exploits similar trophic resources to those exploited by the native B. calamita (competition hypothesis) or alternative resources (opportunistic hypothesis). To this end, we analyzed the stable isotope values of nitrogen and carbon in larvae of both species, in natural ponds and in controlled laboratory conditions. The similarity of the δ15N and δ13C values in the two species coupled with isotopic signal variation according to pond conditions and niche partitioning when they co-occurred indicated dietary competition. Additionally, the non-native species was located at higher levels of trophic niches than the native species and B. calamita suffered an increase in its standard ellipse area when it shared ponds with D. pictus. These results suggest niche displacement of B. calamita to non-preferred resources and greater competitive capacity of D. pictus in field conditions. Moreover, D. pictus showed a broader niche than the native species in all conditions, indicating increased capacity to exploit the diversity of resources; this may indirectly favor its invasiveness. Despite the limitations of this study (derived from potential variability in pond isotopic signals), the results support previous experimental studies. All the studies indicate that D. pictus competes with B. calamita for trophic resources with potential negative effects on the fitness of the latter.",PONE-D-14-49385 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0130549 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Earlier that year, on May 31, the site was struck by a severe storm which rained hailstones exceeding 5.5 cm diameter and spawned an historic 4.2 km-wide tornado <8 km to the south of the site. We hypothesized that this stressor had induced the pallid bands. An assessment of Grasshopper Sparrow nesting phenology indicated that a large number of nestlings were likely growing tail feathers when the storm hit. The pallid bands were restricted to the distal half of feathers and their widths significantly increased as a function of distance from the tip (i.e., age at formation). We predicted that if stress had caused these pallid bands, then a spike in circulating δ (15)N originating from tissue catabolism during the stress response would have been incorporated into the developing feather. From 18 juveniles captured at the site in August we measured δ (15)N and δ (13)C stable isotope ratios within four to five 0.25-0.40 mg feather sections taken from the distal end of a tail feather; the pallid band, if present, was contained within only one section. After accounting for individual and across-section variation, we found support for our prediction that feather sections containing or located immediately proximal to pallid bands (i.e., the pallid band region) would show significantly higher δ (15)N than sections outside this region. In contrast, the feathers of juveniles with pallid bands compared to normal appearing juveniles showed significantly lower δ (15)N. A likely explanation is that the latter individuals hatched after the May 31 storm and had consumed a trophically-shifted diet relative to juveniles with pallid bands. Considering this, the juveniles of normal appearance were significantly less abundant within our sample relative to expectations from past cohorts (z = - 2.03; p = 0.042) and, in as much, suggested widespread nest losses during the storm. Severe weather events may represent major stressors to ground-nesting birds, especially for recent fledglings.

   isotope analyses (hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen) of terrestrial
   invertebrate predators. Small aquatic insects (Nematocera) were most
   abundant under agricultural land use, whereas larger bodied aquatic
   insects (Plecoptera and Trichoptera) were more associated with forest
   land use. Carabid beetles and linyphiid spiders were associated with
   agricultural streams (where there was a high abundance of small aquatic
   insects), whereas lycosid spiders and birds were associated with forest
   streams and a high abundance of large-sized aquatic insects. The
   contribution of aquatic insects to the diets of riparian Lycosidae,
   Linyphiidae and Carabidae was estimated to be 44\%, 60\% and 43\%,
   respectively, indicating the importance of aquatic subsidies to the
   terrestrial system. Our results show that agricultural land use in an
   overall forested landscape can have significant effects on the abundance
   and diet of terrestrial consumers through its impact on the size
   structure of the assemblage of emerging insects, rather than the overall
   magnitude (numbers) of the aquatic subsidy. Hence, our results suggest
   that the composition, not just quantity, of a cross-habitat resource may

   and incidence of low-flow extremes resulting from global climate change

   aimed at quantifying habitat size-related controls on the trophic
   relationships among taxa in streams experiencing extreme flow loss. Here
   we report on a detailed space-for-time survey of replicate stream food
   webs sampled along the perennial- to-drying continuum in each of
   fourteen different intermittent South Island, New Zealand streams. We
   quantified several structural attributes of food webs at fifty-eight
   sites, including two taxonomically-based metrics (web size,
   predator:prey ratio) and three stable isotope-based metrics (food chain
   length {[}FCL], trophic area, C-13 range); we also quantified habitat
   size-, disturbance-, and resource-related covariates at each site. Food
   web structure varied widely across sample sites within and across study
   streams and much of this variation was explained by habitat size.
   Consistent with our predictions, we found that food webs became smaller
   (ca 30 to ca 15 taxa, ca 20-fold reduction in stable isotope-based
   trophic area) and shorter (maximum trophic position {[}FCL] from 4.1 to
   2.0, 25\% reduction in predator:prey ratio) as we moved from the largest
   to smaller habitats. These results, and a comparison of our findings
   with those from a similar assessment conducted in perennial streams,
   suggest that there are perturbation thresholds which may trigger food
   web collapse when exceeded, and further imply that food webs may
   ultimately be sized' to minimum flows rather than average flow
   conditions. Our work provides a basis for making general predictions

   the use of SIA for assessing anthropogenic pressures on natural
   ecosystems, in order to establish current knowledge gaps and identify
   promising applications for evaluating the ecological status of marine
   coastal waters. Specifically, the potential of SIA to provide food
   web-scale indicators for estimating cumulative anthropogenic pressures

   for virtually the whole spectrum of human pressures known to influence
   marine ecosystems. However, only the effects of chemical pollution,
   release of dissolved and particulate nutrients, and invasive species
   have been extensively investigated. For the first two pressures,
   substantial efforts have been made to implement isotopic quantitative
   approaches and metrics for inter-system comparisons; however, with the
   exception of nutrient release, the majority of aquatic studies have been
   carried out in freshwater systems, and only limited information is

   structural attributes. In addition, topographic effects on food web
   structure provide added information within a restoration context; often,
   created sites may require spatial heterogeneity to effectively match
   structure and function of natural habitats. We addressed both of these
   issues in our study of successional development of benthic food web
   structure, with focus on bottom-up-driven changes in macroinvertebrate
   consumer assemblages in the saltmarshes of the Venice Lagoon, Italy. We
   combined quantified estimates of the changing community composition with
   stable isotope data (C-13:C-12 and N-15:N-14) to compare the general
   trophic structure between created (2-14years) marshes and reference

   Macrofaunal invertebrate consumers exhibited local, habitat-specific
   trophic patterns. Stable isotope-based trophic structure changed with
   increasing marsh age, in particular with regard to mid-elevation

   signatures resembled those of unvegetated ponds. The mid-elevation of
   older and natural marshes had a more distinct Salicornia zone food web,
   occasionally resembling that of the highest (Sarcocornia-dominated)
   elevation. In summary, this indicates that primary producers and
   availability of vascular plant detritus structure consumer trophic
   interactions and the flow of carbon. Functionally different consumers,
   subsurface-feeding detritivores (Oligochaeta) and surface grazers

   this, the trophic function of D. villosus and its predation potential
   are rarely studied in natural river communities. Here, we assess the
   trophic function of D. villosus in two invaded systems, the Elbe River
   and the River Rhine, using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses.
   In the two studied river food webs, D. villosus had a generally low
   trophic position (TP), indicating a likely function as primary consumer
   or at most as an omnivore. The significantly higher TP in the River
   Rhine (TP = 2.6) than in the Elbe River (TP = 1.9) suggested a partial
   use of animal prey in the River Rhine. This was supported by the results
   of the isotope mixing model SIAR which predicted in addition to a high
   importance of herbivory in both rivers a likely feeding on other
   invasive amphipod species in the Rhine community. We conclude that D.
   villosus has a variable but mostly low predacious behaviour, probably
   depending on the benthic community structure. To allow more realistic
   trophic analyses for D. villosus in the field, we determined the trophic
   enrichment factors (TEFs) for nitrogen and carbon isotopes of two diet
   types in the tissue of D. villosus in an eight-week laboratory
   experiment. The carbon isotope enrichment (Delta delta C-13) from the
   chironomid diet was negative in the consumer (-1.75 \%), whereas the
   carbon from leaf litter was enriched positively in the tissue (3.27 \%).
   The TEFs for nitrogen (Delta delta N-15) were more similar for plant and
   animal diet (leaf litter: 3.56 \%, chironomids: 2.29 \%). Because of the
   high specificity of the enrichment factors with respect to species and
   food source, we recommend their use in further trophic analyses.",10.3391/ai.2015.10.4.03,"trophic enrichment factor; stable isotope analysis; trophic position;

Ligang Zhou and Sandra J. Garvie-Lok,2015,"Isotopic evidence for the expansion of wheat consumption in northern
   China",ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN ASIA,"Flotation and carbon dating indicate that wheat was introduced into
   northern China, where millet agriculture had existed for thousands of
   years, around 3000-2000 BC. Wheat eventually replaced millet as the
   staple of northern Chinese diets, but it is still unclear how it was
   added to the established agricultural system and when millet finally
   lost its staple role to the imported crop. Because wheat and millet have
   distinct delta C-13 values, stable isotope analysis offers an
   opportunity to answer these questions. Here, we review published stable
   isotope data for 645 human samples from 36 sites in northern China,
   dating from 3000 to 2000 BC to the sixth century AD, summarizing the
   current evidence for dietary changes since the appearance of wheat. The
   results indicate that wheat had little influence on human nutrition at
   its first appearance. The first possible evidence for wheat consumption
   is seen in Xinjiang about 1800 BC. Further east in Qinghai and Gansu, a
   shift from C4-based diets to mixed C4/C3-based diets occurred between
   2000 and 1500 BC. In areas further east, millet continues to dominate
   human diets for the following two millennia, although wheat has been
   widely recovered in archeological contexts and its importance in
   agriculture was recorded in contemporary documents. Itwas only in the
   sixth century AD that C3 crops became important in human diets in the
   east of northern China. This is quite different fromthe scenario
   depicted by palaeobotanical studies, and illustrates the need for
   further stable isotope analysis of human and faunal remains to better
   characterize the millet-wheat transition in northern China. (C) 2015

   ecosystems, experimenting diet shifting during their life history
   development. Salmonid invasions have impacted their natural ecology
   through trophic niche interference and predation over alternative high
   quality prey. This study focuses on populations of P. trucha in western
   Patagonia, where its trophic ecology have been less understood. We
   hypothesised a diet shift between juveniles and adults from lowertrophic
   position prey towards higher-trophic position prey. Fish were collected
   from 7 lakes belonging to Puelo and Baker river basins, covering a high
   diversity of environmental conditions. Stomach content and delta N-15

   Results indicate significant differences in diet between juveniles and

   in studied river basins, no salmonid-free lakes harbouring this two
   native species were found, making it difficult to elucidate exact

   Fishes of Lake Turkana, Kenya",PLOS ONE,"Background and Trophic Diversity Study
   Lake Turkana is an understudied desert lake shared by Kenya and
   Ethiopia. This system is at the precipice of large-scale changes in
   ecological function due to climate change and economic development along
   its major inflowing river, the Omo River. To anticipate response by the
   fish community to these changes, we quantified trophic diversity for
   seven ecological disparate species (Alestes baremose, Hydrocynus
   forskalli, Labeo horie, Lates niloticus, Oreochromis niloticus,
   Synodontis schall, and Tilapia zillii) using stable isotopes. Based on
   their marked morphological differentiation, we postulated that dietary
   niches of these species would be similar in size but show little
   overlap. The degree of trophic diversity varied greatly among the
   species studied, refuting our hypothesis regarding dietary niche size.
   Oreochromis niloticus and L. niloticus had the highest trophic diversity
   and significantly larger dietary niches than T. zillii, A. baremose and
   H. forskalli. Low overlap among the dietary niches of the seven species,
   with the exception of the synodontid catfish S. schall, is consistent
   with our second hypothesis.
   Predicting Species' Vulnerability
   Breeding vulnerability was highest among those species with the lowest
   trophic diversity. We predict that in suffering two strikes against
   them, A. baremose, H. forskalli, T. zillii, and L. horiewill be most
   affected by the highly altered Lake Turkana ecosystem and that O.
   niloticus, L. niloticus and S. schall will be least affected. Low
   vulnerability among O. niloticus and L. niloticus is promising for the
   future of the lake's fishery, but the third most important fishery
   species (L. horie) will be highly vulnerable to impending ecosystem
   change. T. zillii should be treated as separate from O. niloticus in the
   fishery given higher sensitivity and a different ecological role. We see
   potential for expansion of the fishery for S. schallbut don't recommend
   the development of a fishery for A. baremose and H. forskalli.",10.1371/journal.pone.0127027,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

   evidence",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"The palaeoecological assessment, and the use of stable isotopes of
   carbon in subfossils of herbivores and omnivores, represents a novel
   approach to understand transitions in past food-web structure and the
   dynamics of lake ecosystems in response to natural perturbations and
   human impacts. Combined with records of subfossil assemblages of
   cladocerans and chironomids, it may be possible to decipher whether
   changes are attributable to external forces or internally derived system
   shifts.
   A sediment record taken from the shallow (2.3m depth) Kings Billabong in
   the River Murray floodplain (Australia) was analysed to explore changes
   in trophic dynamics over the past century.
   The palaeoecological assessment revealed that littoral assemblages of
   cladocerans and benthic diatoms were gradually replaced by planktonic
   (planktonic and facultative planktonic) assemblages after river
   regulation in the 1920s.
   The stable isotopic composition of carbon (C-13), derived from
   chironomid head capsules, was relatively constant down-core, ranging
   between -26.1 and -24.0, and coincided largely with the C-13 of bulk
   sediment samples (-25.6 parts per thousand to -22.0 parts per thousand).
   The C-13 values of pelagic (Daphnia) and ubiquitous (Bosmina, Alona)
   cladocerans, however, varied markedly, with that for Daphnia between
   -29.8 parts per thousand (10-20cm) and -23.2 parts per thousand
   (60-70cm), and for ubiquitous cladocerans, between -29.4 parts per
   thousand (20-30cm) and -24.5 parts per thousand (80-70cm).
   The temporal changes in the C-13 values of cladocerans also suggest a
   gradual transition from a macrophyte-dominated state to a
   phytoplankton-dominated state after river regulation and further
   indicate changes in the horizontal migration behaviour of Daphnia
   depending on macrophyte abundance and predation risk.

   carbon dioxide (CO2) and increasing use of genetically modified (GM)
   crops in agriculture may affect soil food-webs. So we designed a study
   for the assessment of the effects of elevated CO2 (eCO(2))
   concentrations and GM barley on a soil-mesofauna community employing a
   2nd tier mesocosm test system. The GM barley, Hordeum vulgare cv. Golden
   Promise, had a modified content of amino acids and it was compared with
   three non-GM barley cultivated varieties including the isogenic line.
   Our mesocosm experiment was conducted in a greenhouse at ambient
   (aCO(2)) and eCO(2) (+80 ppm) levels and included a multispecies
   assemblage of Collembola, Acari and Enchytraeidae with either a GM or
   conventional spring barley varieties. To detect food-web changes we
   added dried maize leaves naturally enriched in delta C-13 and delta N-15
   relative to the soil substrate. Soil, plants and animals were collected
   after five and eleven weeks. We found that the eCO(2) concentration did
   not affect the plant biomass, but the predatory mite and two collembolan
   species showed significantly lower abundances at eCO(2). The densities
   of three collembolan species (Folsomia fimetaria, Proisotoma minuta and
   juveniles of Mesaphorura macrochaeta) was significantly lower in the GM
   treatment compared to some of the non-GM varieties. F. fimetaria was
   less abundant in presence of GM barley compared to the cultivated barley
   variety ``Netto{''} at both CO2 levels, while the density of P. minuta
   was significantly reduced with the GM barley compared to variety
   ``Netto{''} at aCO(2) and the isogenic variety at eCO(2). Maize litter
   acted as a food source for the community, as it was revealed by delta
   C-13 values in rnicroarthropods. Microarthropod delta C-13 decreased
   over time, which, indicates a diet change of the species towards carbon
   derived from barley, due to maize litter decomposition. The industrially
   produced CO2 gas also had a role as an isotopic marker, as the different
   delta C-13 values were reflected in the barley and in the collembolan
   species. GM barley did not affect delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of
   soil animals indicating that the overall trophic structure of the
   mesofauna community was not changed compared to the non-GM cultivated
   varieties. The mesocosm methodology integrating stable isotope analysis
   demonstrates the potential of the multi-species mesocosm as a tool to

   different trophic levels from six estuaries in Southeast Queensland,

   Significant linear relationships exist between fish delta N-15 and urban

   Understanding of historical changes in marine ecosystems can help us to

   northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus, NFS) to investigate potential
   long-term ecosystem changes in the western North Pacific Ocean off
   northeastern Japan over the past 60 years. Total commercial catches
   experienced peaks around 1960 and during the 1980s, decreasing to low
   levels around 1970 and after 1990. Catches were substantively impacted
   by the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in 2011. Species composition of the
   commercial catch changed over time, resulting in changes in the mean
   trophic level (MTL) of the catches. Trends in observed commercial
   catches were affected by many factors, including species population
   fluctuations potentially related to large-scale environmental shifts,
   migration and distribution patterns of species related to local
   oceanography, changes in fishing technology, and the introduction of
   fishery management frameworks. The composition of NFS diet also changed
   over time: although overall changes were small, MTL derived from NFS
   stomach contents declined from the early 1970s to the late 1980s. This
   fall in the MTL of the diet of NFS is suggestive of a shift in pelagic
   fish fauna from a ``mackerel-dominant regime{''} to a ``sardine-dominant
   regime{''}. Inconsistencies between changes in species composition and
   MTLs of the commercial catch and NFS diet resulted from differences in
   commercial fishing targeting and NFS foraging behavior strategies.
   Although commercial catch is a valuable source of information for
   investigating historical changes in fisheries, biological resources, and

   terrestrial habitats. Nevertheless, it has been proposed that, in
   temperate aquatic systems, the energetic demands from bottom-feeding
   fish are supplied by primary production from phytoplankton in pelagic
   habitats. Thus, we aimed to determine which of several energy sources
   support bottom-feeding fish in tropical aquatic systems, where primary
   producers are diverse. We performed samplings in the Parana River
   floodplain from primary producers in littoral (periphyton), pelagic

   simultaneous signatures of C and N isotope ratios, we analysed the
   possible origin of available energy in muscles of nine different

   species had the highest contribution of carbon from a littoral source
   compared to other energy sources, independent of trophic category. The
   importance of periphyton may be related to the high abundance of
   substrates (such as macrophytes) that are available in the littoral zone
   of tropical aquatic systems. Finally, we suggest that the actual carbon

This ""dynamic food web approach"" is rarely applied at the coastal margin where aquatic and terrestrial systems are coupled and human development activities are often concentrated. We propose a simple model of ghost crab (Ocypode quadrata) feeding that predicts changing dominant prey (Emerita talpoida, Talorchestia sp., Donax variablis) along a gradient of beach morphology and test this model using a suite of 16 beaches along the Florida, USA coast. Assessment of beaches included quantification of morphological features (width, sediments, slope), macrophyte wrack, macro-invertebrate prey and active ghost crab burrows. Stable isotope analysis of carbon ((13)C/(12)C) and nitrogen ((15)N/(14)N) and the SIAR mixing model were used to determine dietary composition of ghost crabs at each beach. The variation in habitat conditions displayed with increasing beach width was accompanied by quantifiable shifts in ghost crab diet and trophic position. Patterns of ghost crab diet were consistent with differences recorded across the beach width gradient with respect to the availability of preferred micro-habitats of principal macro-invertebrate prey. Values obtained for trophic position also suggests that the generalist ghost crab assembles and augments its diet in fundamentally different ways as habitat morphology varies across a highly dynamic ecosystem. Our results offer support for a functional response in the trophic architecture of a common food web compartment (ghost crabs, macro-invertebrate prey) across well-known beach morphologies. More importantly, our ""dynamic food web approach"" serves as a basis for evaluating how globally wide-spread sandy beach ecosystems should respond to a variety of anthropogenic impacts including beach grooming, beach re-nourishment, introduction of non-native or feral predators and human traffic on beaches.",PONE-D-15-42980 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0147759 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preserving biodiversity in these areas involves protecting species-like frugivorous bats-that are important to forest regeneration. Fruit bats provide critical ecosystem services including seed dispersal, but studies of how their diets are affected by habitat change have often been rather localized. This study used stable isotope analyses (δ15N and δ13C measurement) to examine how two fruit bat species in Madagascar, Pteropus rufus (n = 138) and Eidolon dupreanum (n = 52) are impacted by habitat change across a large spatial scale. Limited data for Rousettus madagascariensis are also presented. Our results indicated that the three species had broadly overlapping diets. Differences in diet were nonetheless detectable between P. rufus and E. dupreanum, and these diets shifted when they co-occurred, suggesting resource partitioning across habitats and vertical strata within the canopy to avoid competition. Changes in diet were correlated with a decrease in forest cover, though at a larger spatial scale in P. rufus than in E. dupreanum.

Here we review our understanding of the bioenergetics and feeding dynamics of tunas on a global scale, with an emphasis on yellowfin, bigeye, skipjack, albacore, and Atlantic bluefin tunas. Food consumption balances bioenergetics expenditures for respiration, growth (including gonad production), specific dynamic action, egestion, and excretion. Tunas feed across the micronekton and some large zooplankton. Some tunas appear to time their life history to take advantage of ephemeral aggregations of crustacean, fish, and molluscan prey. Ontogenetic and spatial diet differences are substantial, and significant interdecadal changes in prey composition have been observed. Diet shifts from larger to smaller prey taxa highlight ecosystem-wide changes in prey availability and diversity and provide implications for changing bioenergetics requirements into the future. Where tunas overlap, we show evidence of niche separation between them; resources are divided largely by differences in diet percentages and size ranges of prey taxa. The lack of long-term data limits the ability to predict impacts of climate change on tuna feeding behaviour. We note the need for systematic collection of feeding data as part of routine monitoring of these species, and we highlight the advantages of using biochemical techniques for broad-scale analyses of trophic relations.

However, uncertainties remain regarding the use of δ2H, since little is known about the potential variation in the amount of exchangeable hydrogen (Hex) among common sample materials or the patterns of δ2H when entire food webs are considered. We assessed differences in Hex among the typical sample materials in freshwater studies and used δ2H, δ13C and δ15N to compare their effectiveness in tracing allochthonous matter in food webs of two small temperate lakes. Our results showed higher average amounts of Hex in animal tissues (27% in fish and macroinvertebrates, 19% in zooplankton) compared to most plant material (15% in terrestrial plants and 8% in seston/periphyton), with the exception of aquatic vascular plants (23%, referred to as macrophytes). The amount of Hex correlated strongly with sample lipid content (inferred from C:N ratios) in fish and zooplankton samples. Overall, the three isotopes provided good separation of sources (seston, periphyton, macrophytes and allochthonous organic matter), particularly the δ2H followed by δ13C. Aquatic macrophytes revealed unexpectedly high δ2H values, having more elevated δ2H values than terrestrial organic matter with direct implications for estimating consumer allochthony.

"Jaatinen, Kim and Öst, Markus and Hobson, Keith A",2016,State-dependent capital and income breeding: a novel approach to evaluating individual strategies with stable isotopes.,Frontiers in zoology,"BACKGROUND: Species-specific strategies for financing the costs of reproduction are well understood, forming a continuum ranging from high to low reliance on stored nutrients. Animals relying mostly on stored reserves are termed 'capital breeders', whereas 'income breeders' rely mostly on concurrent intake when financing the costs of reproduction. The role and adaptive value of individual variation in these strategies remain elusive. Life-history theory posits that capital breeding should be favoured when offspring reproductive value peaks, typically occurring early in the season, and that current income should increasingly be used with progressing season. Because resource limitation may hamper flexible resource allocation, a corollary prediction is that only good-condition individuals may show the expected seasonal shift in resource use. To test this prediction, we examined stable isotopes (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) in blood and lipid-free egg yolk of breeding eider females (Somateria mollissima) from the Baltic Sea to assess the role of individual variation in the use of proteins from local diet vs. stored reserves. RESULTS: We show for the first time that individuals from a single population differ in their utilization of stored reserves and concurrent intake to finance the costs of reproduction. Consistent with our prediction, heavy females predominantly used stored reserves for producing egg yolks early in the season, increasingly relying on local feeding with later onset of breeding, whereas light females showed no seasonal change in allocation strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Stable isotope profiling at the individual level is a powerful tool for monitoring relative changes in investment strategies through time, showing promise as an early warning indicator of ecological change in food webs.",157 [pii] and 10.1186/s12983-016-0157-x [doi],Capital vs. income and Climate change and Reproductive allocation and Resource allocation and Somateria mollissima and Stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hydrothermally extinct, or inactive, sulfide deposits also host microbial communities at globally distributed sites. The main goal of this study is to describe Fe transformation pathways, through precipitation and oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions, and examine transformation products for signatures of biological activity using Fe mineralogy and stable isotope approaches. The study includes active and inactive sulfides from the East Pacific Rise 9°50'N vent field. First, the mineralogy of Fe(III)-bearing precipitates is investigated using microprobe X-ray absorption spectroscopy (μXAS) and X-ray diffraction (μXRD). Second, laser-ablation (LA) and micro-drilling (MD) are used to obtain spatially-resolved Fe stable isotope analysis by multicollector-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). Eight Fe-bearing minerals representing three mineralogical classes are present in the samples: oxyhydroxides, secondary phyllosilicates, and sulfides. For Fe oxyhydroxides within chimney walls and layers of Si-rich material, enrichments in both heavy and light Fe isotopes relative to pyrite are observed, yielding a range of δ(57)Fe values up to 6‰. Overall, several pathways for Fe transformation are observed. Pathway 1 is characterized by precipitation of primary sulfide minerals from Fe(II)aq-rich fluids in zones of mixing between vent fluids and seawater. Pathway 2 is also consistent with zones of mixing but involves precipitation of sulfide minerals from Fe(II)aq generated by Fe(III) reduction. Pathway 3 is direct oxidation of Fe(II) aq from hydrothermal fluids to form Fe(III) precipitates. Finally, Pathway 4 involves oxidative alteration of pre-existing sulfide minerals to form Fe(III). The Fe mineralogy and isotope data do not support or refute a unique biological role in sulfide alteration. The findings reveal a dynamic range of Fe transformation pathways consistent with a continuum of micro-environments having variable redox conditions. These micro-environments likely support redox cycling of Fe and S and are consistent with culture-dependent and -independent assessments of microbial physiology and genetic diversity of hydrothermal sulfide deposits.",10.3389/fmicb.2016.00648 [doi],East Pacific Rise and X-ray absorption spectroscopy and biosignature and hydrothermal and iron and micro-environment and mineral alteration and stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Muir and Nigel Lester and Brian Shuter and Neil Rooney,2016,The adaptive capacity of lake food webs: from individuals to ecosystems,ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,"Aquatic ecosystems support size structured food webs, wherein
   predator-prey body sizes span orders of magnitude. As such, these food
   webs are replete with extremely generalized feeding strategies,
   especially among the larger bodied, higher trophic position taxa. The
   movement scale of aquatic organisms also generally increases with body
   size and trophic position. Together, these body size, mobility, and
   foraging relationships suggest that organisms lower in the food web
   generate relatively distinct energetic pathways by feeding over smaller
   spatial areas. Concurrently, the potential capacity for generalist
   foraging and spatial coupling of these pathways often increases, on
   average, moving up the food web toward higher trophic levels. We argue
   that these attributes make for a food web architecture that is
   inherently `adaptive' in its response to environmental conditions. This
   is because variation in lower trophic level dynamics is dampened by the
   capacity of predators to flexibly alter their foraging behavior. We
   argue that empirical, theoretical, and applied research needs to embrace
   this inherently adaptive architecture if we are to understand the
   relationship between structure and function in the face of ongoing
   environmental change. Toward this goal, we discuss empirical patterns in
   the structure of lake food webs to suggest that ecosystems change
   consistently, from individual traits to the structure of whole food
   webs, under changing environmental conditions. We then explore an
   empirical example to reveal that explicitly unfolding the mechanisms
   that drive these adaptive responses offers insight into how human-driven
   impacts, such as climate change, invasive species, and fisheries
   harvest, ought to influence ecosystem structure and function (e.g.,

   allochthonous origin (i.e., recycled terrestrial matter). Landuse
   activities modify basal resources and consumer community composition in
   aquatic systems and, thereby, aquatic resource fluxes to terrestrial
   systems. The origin of aquatic terrestrial resource fluxes and

   in Lithuania, is among the most affected by agricultural activities.
   Although seriously disturbed by land reclamation and agricultural
   pollution, the Nevezis River still has natural, anthropogenically
   unaffected stretches. Fish species were studied at two sites of the
   upper part of the river with different hydrological regime, exhibiting
   clear differences in the trophic status of fish. The combined effect of
   hydrogeomorphic and water-chemistry variability on the stable isotope
   composition of fish assemblages in Lithuania has not been investigated.
   The presently reported study was intended to explore the possible
   effects of the riverbed morphology and agricultural activities on the
   chemistry and stable isotope composition of the three main fish species.
   Materials and methods. This study covered three species of freshwater
   fishes: the European perch, Perca fluviatilis Linnaeus, 1758; the roach,
   Rutilus rutilus (Linnaeus, 1758); and the northern pike, Esox lucius
   Linnaeus, 1758. The sampling was performed in both natural and regulated
   river stretches using backpack electrofishing equipment. Stable isotope
   composition of the samples was revealed by applying stable isotope
   analyses (SIA) with an elemental analyser connected to an isotope ratio
   mass spectrometer. To obtain more information about environmental
   variability and variation of stable isotopes delta C-13 and delta N-15
   in fish, the entire data matrix was analysed using Principal Component
   Analysis (PCA).
   Results. In the study sites on the Nevezis River, algal carbon isotope
   ratios were more C-13-depleted than those from terrestrial sources. The
   fishes were clearly dependent on terrestrial carbon sources in natural
   locations. However, the fishes collected from regulated sites had carbon
   isotope signatures more similar to algal than to terrestrial sources.
   Mean values of delta N-15 of the fishes from the natural sites were

   functioning of a highly dynamic marine environment",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY,"Carbon flow through ecosystems is determined by the nature, availability
   and incorporation of basal resources (BRs) to higher trophic levels of
   food webs. The occurrence of abundant supplementary BR often diversifies
   trophic niches within food webs. Blooms of opportunistic macroalgae,
   which may act as additional BRs, have increased in intensity, and are
   expected to amplify further because of global change. Understanding the
   effects of high biomasses of opportunistic BRs on the functioning of
   naturally unvegetated coastal ecosystems is thus crucial. We set out to
   assess whether and how green algae (opportunistic BR) modifies
   macrotidal sandy beach trophic structure and functioning. We also
   investigated whether these effects propagate up through the web, looking
   at different scales and trophic levels (i.e. primary producers, specific
   primary consumers, and the general higher-consumer assemblage). To
   achieve these objectives, we used a high-resolution field sampling (over
   1200 individual stable isotope-, and 180 biodiversity samples) at
   pristine and macroalgal-bloom-affected macrotidal sandy beaches,
   together with recent and novel analytical approaches (biomass-weighted
   isotope signatures, Isotopic Functional Indices). We found that the
   opportunistic BR, both directly and indirectly affects the entire beach
   food web across several trophic levels, by inducing shifts in trophic
   interactions. Overall, we found that the dominance of a BR in the form
   of opportunistic algae simplifies the entire food web over time. Our
   findings challenge the paradigm that addition of BR inherently
   diversifies trophic interactions within an ecosystem, and have

   in human-modified landscapes for many vertebrate species. Such resources
   can alter individual foraging behavior of animals, and induce
   population-wide changes. Yet, little consensus exists about the relative
   influence of the availabilities of native and human food subsidies to
   wildlife foraging throughout altered landscapes. We explored this
   unresolved question by analyzing the effects of landscape factors on
   American black bear (Ursus americanus) diet across the state of
   Colorado, USA. We estimated assimilated diet using stable isotope
   analysis of harvested black bear tissues to determine the contribution
   of human-derived foods to bear diets throughout Colorado, as well as how
   increasing reliance on human-derived food subsidies increases the risk
   of conflict. We found that bears (n = 296) showed strong regional diet
   variability, but substantial use of human-derived food subsidies in
   eastern Colorado (>30\% assimilated diet). The age-sex class of the bear
   and housing density of its harvest location were the most influential
   predictors of C-13 enrichment (a tracer of human food subsidies).
   Furthermore, foraging on subsidies increased risk of conflict; the odds
   of being a nuisance bear increased by 60\% for each similar to 1 parts
   per thousand increase in delta C-13. Our study confirms the efficacy of
   delta C-13 as a proxy for human activity, and indicates that while
   demographic differences play a clear role in the foraging ecology of
   bears, availability of subsidies coincident with varying levels of human
   activity appears to be a major driver in predicting black bear diet

   plasma samples were used to examine the isotopic niche of lactating
   female Antarctic fur seals. Using recently developed Bayesian approaches
   to determine changes in isotopic niche, a significant increase in delta

   occurred at an average rate of 0.067\%0 (delta C-13) and 0.072\%0 (delta

   to a shift in diet towards prey at a higher trophic level, such as fish
   (replacing krill). Although our sampling design prevented us from

   and site did not significantly affect the isotopic composition of
   mussels; however significant variation was detected in delta N-15 values

   from the 1950s, 1980s and 2000s were used to create three Ecopath
   mass-balance models. These Ecopath models were validated by the stable

   Caribbean archipelago during the Ceramic Age (400 BC-AD 1500), through
   analyses of dental wear and pathology. Some previous studies in the
   region have suggested that diet and subsistence practices changed over
   time due to increasing sociopolitical complexity, climate change, or
   adaptation to island environments rich in marine resources. Both
   horticultural/agricultural intensification and increased marine focus of
   the diet over time have been posited, based among other things on faunal
   and botanical remains, and early ethnohistorical accounts. Local and
   micro-regional stable isotope studies of temporal dietary variation have
   found few indications for change over time, and large regional isotope
   studies are still lacking.
   Dentitions from sites throughout the region dating to the Early Ceramic
   Age (400 BC-AD 600/800) and the Late Ceramic Age (AD 600/800-1500) were
   analysed in order to assess temporal differences. Intra-individual rates
   of wear were calculated using the difference in degree of wear between
   the adjacent molars and the two groups were compared with principal axis
   analysis. Caries, antemortem tooth loss, abscesses and dental calculus
   were recorded per individual and per tooth/socket, and population caries
   and antemortem tooth loss rates were assessed and compared by age group,
   tooth class and sex.
   Comparisons between the two occupation periods revealed significant
   differences in the rate of dental wear and pathology, indicating a shift

   The increase in pathology rates suggests a rise in the consumption of
   cariogenic foods or preparation techniques that increase cariogenicity.
   The decrease in rate of wear over time indicates a reduction in

   carbon using carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopes
   measured in muscle tissue. Benthic-foraging kelp greenling (Hexagrammos
   decagrammus) and pelagic-foraging black rockfish (Sebastes melanops)
   were collected at eight sites spanning similar to 35 to 60 degrees N
   from the California Current (upwelling) to Alaska Coastal Current

   were expected to be higher for fish tissue primarily derived from kelp,
   a benthic macroalgae, and lower for tissue primarily derived from
   phytoplankton, pelagic microalgae. Muscle delta C-13 values were higher
   in benthic-feeding kelp greenling than in pelagic-feeding black rockfish

   greenling as expected. Estimates of kelp carbon contributions ranged

   mode of nearshore predators has a small influence on their ultimate
   energy source as energy produced by benthic macroalgae and pelagic

   spatiotemporal patterns of fish and jellyfish trophic structure in

   widths and trophic overlap between fish and jellyfish assemblages, and
   several community-level trophic diversity metrics (resource diversity,
   trophic length, and niche widths) of fish and jellyfish combined. We
   then related assemblage- and community-level measures to landscape
   gradients of terrestrial-marine connectivity and anthropogenic influence
   in adjacent catchments. Relative niche positions among species varied
   considerably and displayed no clear pattern except that fish generally
   had higher delta N-15 and lower delta C-13 relative to jellyfish, which
   resulted in low assemblage-level trophic overlap. Fish assemblages had
   larger niche widths than jellyfish in most cases and, along with whole
   community trophic diversity, exhibited contrasting seasonal patterns
   across oceanographic basins, which was positively correlated to
   landscape variation in terrestrial connectivity. In contrast, jellyfish
   niche widths were unrelated to terrestrial connectivity, but weakly
   negatively correlated to urban land use in adjacent catchments. Our
   results indicate that fish-jellyfish trophic structure is highly
   heterogeneous and that disparate processes may underlie the trophic

   perturbations in the ecosystem through ocean warming are altering
   food-web structure and have been linked to poleward shifts in the

   focused on 2 small congeneric petrels: the broad-billed prion Pachyptila

   the broad-billed prion specialises in feeding on large copepods. We

   anthropogenic disturbance and environmental change on communities, are
   key challenges in ecology. Despite the pressing need to understand these
   fundamental drivers of community structure and dynamics, only 17\% of
   ecological studies conducted over the past three decades have been at
   the community level.
   2. Here, we assess the trophic structure of the procellariiform
   community breeding at South Georgia, to identify the factors that
   determine foraging niches and possible temporal changes. We collected
   conventional diet data from 13 sympatric species between 1974 and 2002,
   and quantified intra-and inter-guild, and annual variation in diet
   between and within foraging habits. In addition, we tested the
   reliability of stable isotope analysis (SIA) of seabird feathers
   collected over a 13-year period, in relation to those of their potential
   prey, as a tool to assess community structure when diets are diverse and
   there is high spatial heterogeneity in environmental baselines.
   3. Our results using conventional diet data identified a four-guild
   community structure, distinguishing species that mainly feed on
   crustaceans; large fish and squid; a mixture of crustaceans, small fish
   and squid; or carrion. In total, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba
   represented 32\%, and 14 other species a further 46\% of the combined
   diet of all 13 predators, underlining the reliance of this community on
   relatively few types of prey. Annual variation in trophic segregation
   depended on relative prey availability; however, our data did not
   provide evidence of changes in guild structure associated with a
   suggested decline in Antarctic krill abundance over the past 40 years.
   4. Reflecting the differences in delta N-15 of potential prey
   (crustaceans vs. squid vs. fish and carrion), analysis of delta N-15 in
   chick feathers identified a three-guild community structure that was
   constant over a 13-year period, but lacked the trophic cluster
   representing giant petrels which was identified using conventional diet
   data.
   5. Our study is the first in recent decades to examine dietary changes

   distribution in a high Arctic fjord (Kongsfjorden, Svalbard)",JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS,"With climate change, the strong seasonality and tight pelagic-benthic
   coupling in the Arctic is expected to change in the next few decades. It
   is currently unclear how the benthos will be affected by changes of
   environmental conditions such as supplies of organic matter (OM) from
   the water column. In the last decade, Kongsfjorden (79 degrees N), a
   high Arctic fjord in Svalbard influenced by several glaciers and
   Atlantic water inflow, has been a site of great interest owing to its
   high sensitivity to climate change, evidenced by a reduction in ice
   cover and an increase in melting freshwater. To investigate how spatial
   and seasonal changes in vertical fluxes can impact the benthic
   compartment of Kongsfjorden, we studied the organic matter
   characteristics (in terms of quantity and quality) and prokaryotic
   distribution in sediments from 3 stations along a transect extending
   from the glacier into the outer fjord in 4 different seasons (spring,
   summer, autumn and winter) in 2012-2013. The biochemical parameters used
   to describe the sedimentary organic matter were organic carbon (OC),
   total nitrogen, bulk stable isotope ratios, pigments (chorophyll-a and
   phaeopigments) and biopolymeric carbon (BPC), which is the sum of the
   main macromolecules, i.e. lipids, proteins and carbohydrates.
   Prokaryotic abundance and distribution were estimated by
   4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. This study identifies a
   well-marked quantitative gradient of biogenic compounds throughout all
   seasons and also highlights a discrepancy between the quantity and
   quality of sedimentary organic matter within the fjord. The sediments
   near the glacier were organic-poor (<0.3\%OC), however the high primary
   productivity in the water column displayed during spring was reflected
   in summer sediments, and exhibited higher freshness of material at the
   inner station compared to the outer basin (means C-chlorophyll-a/OC
   similar to 5 and 1.5\%, respectively). However, sediments at the glacier
   front were depleted in BPC (similar to 02-0.3 mg C g(-1) DW) by 4.5 and
   9 times compared to sediments from the inner and outer stations. delta
   C-13 values in sedimentary organic matter of Kongsfjorden varied between
   23.8 and 19.3\% and reflected distinct sources of organic matter between
   basins. Bacterial total cell numbers in sediments of Kongsfjorden were
   <2 x 10(8) cells ml(-1) and the prokaryotic community structure was
   strongly influenced by the marked environmental biogenic gradients.
   Overall, the spatial variability prevailed over the seasonal variability
   in sediments of Kongsfjorden suggesting that glacier inputs prominently
   control the functioning of this benthic ecosystem and its communities.

   location as well as accounting for spatial differences in the isotopic
   ranges of potential prey. Total isotopic niche width (TINW) for
   populations of ringed seals and beluga decreased with increasing

   isotopic analyses of mountain gazelle, bezoar goat and aurochsen bone

   Late Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) goats relative to Middle PPNB goats,
   which are also enriched in C-13 relative to contemporaneous gazelle.
   This shift may reflect a greater catchment from which morphologically

   provided with some fodder. If the latter is the case, then the use of
   fodder by 7500 cal BC at Kfar HaHoresh is a relatively late development,
   emerging several hundred years after goat husbandry strategies
   emphasising a juvenile harvest and fodder provisioning that first came
   into use in the Mediterranean region of the southern Levant. There is a
   pronounced enrichment of nitrogen isotopes in Early PPNB aurochsen,
   ritually important animals derived from a unique feasting deposit,
   relative to that of gazelle and goats. Though this may reflect more
   specialised feeding behaviour in aurochsen compared to the other two
   bovid groups, an alternative interpretation is that the aurochsen
   ingested enriched N-15 from manured pasture, following restriction of
   their movement by people. These isotopic data support the documented

Diet shifts in Procambarus clarkii.,PloS one,"In the Mediterranean basin, the globally increasing temperatures are expected to be accompanied by longer heat waves. Commonly assumed to benefit cold-limited invasive alien species, these climatic changes may also change their feeding preferences, especially in the case of omnivorous ectotherms. We investigated heat wave effects on diet choice, growth and energy reserves in the invasive red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. In laboratory experiments, we fed juvenile and adult crayfish on animal, plant or mixed diets and exposed them to a short or a long heat wave. We then measured crayfish survival, growth, body reserves and Fulton's condition index. Diet choices of the crayfish maintained on the mixed diet were estimated using stable isotopes (13C and 15N). The results suggest a decreased efficiency of carnivorous diets at higher temperatures, as juveniles fed on the animal diet were unable to maintain high growth rates in the long heat wave; and a decreased efficiency of herbivorous diets at lower temperatures, as juveniles in the cold accumulated less body reserves when fed on the plant diet. Heat wave treatments increased the assimilation of plant material, especially in juveniles, allowing them to sustain high growth rates in the long heat wave. Contrary to our expectations, crayfish performance decreased in the long heat wave, suggesting that Mediterranean summer heat waves may have negative effects on P. clarkii and that they are unlikely to boost its populations in this region. Although uncertain, it is possible that the greater assimilation of the plant diet resulted from changes in crayfish feeding preferences, raising the hypotheses that i) heat waves may change the predominant impacts of this keystone species and ii) that by altering species' trophic niches, climate change may alter the main impacts of invasive alien species.",PONE-D-17-12131 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0183108 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Salt marshes represent such boundary habitats, characterized by frequent inundations increasing from the terrestrial upper to the marine pioneer zone. Despite the high abundance of soil mesofauna in salt marshes and their important function by facilitating energy and carbon flows, the structure, trophic ecology and habitat-related diet shifts of mesofauna species in natural salt marsh habitats is virtually unknown. Therefore, we investigated the effects of natural disturbance (inundation frequency) on community structure, food web complexity and resource use of soil mesofauna using stable isotope analysis (15N, 13C) in three salt marsh zones. In this intertidal habitat, the pioneer zone is exposed to inundations twice a day, but lower and upper salt marshes are less frequently inundated based on shore height. The mesofauna comprised 86 species / taxa dominated by Collembola, Oribatida and Mesostigmata. Shifts in environmental disturbances influenced the structure of food webs, diversity and density declined strongly from the land to the sea pointing to the importance of increasing levels of inundation frequency. Accordingly, the reduced diversity and density was associated by a simplification of the food web in the pioneer zone as compared to the less inundated lower and upper salt marsh with a higher number of trophic levels. Strong variations in δ15N signatures demonstrated that mesofauna species are feeding at multiple trophic levels. Primary decomposers were low and most mesofauna species functioned as secondary decomposers or predators including second order predators or scavengers. The results document that major decomposer taxa, such as Collembola and Oribatida, are more diverse than previously assumed and predominantly dwell on autochthonous resources of the respective salt marsh zone. The results further suggest that Mesostigmata mostly adopt an intraguild predation lifestyle. The high trophic position of a large number of predators suggests that intraguild predation is of significant importance in salt marsh food webs. Presumably, intraguild predation contributes to stabilizing the salt marsh food web against disturbances.",PONE-D-17-25249 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0189645 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The invasion of the Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) into these lakes has changed several facets of black bass biology, but there is still much to learn about the relationship between these species. Previous dietary analyses have shown Round Goby to be important prey for bass, but have been limited by low visual identification rates of dissected stomach items. Within the present study, DNA barcoding and stable isotope analysis improve prey identification and provide a more quantitative dietary analysis of adult black bass in Lake Ontario, comparing the importance of Round Goby as prey between these two species. Eighty-four LMB (406mm fork length ±4mm SEM) and two hundred sixty-four SMB (422mm ±2mm) obtained as tournament mortalities had prey identified using DNA-based methods. Round Goby was the most prevalent prey species for both predators. The diet of LMB was three times more diverse than that of SMB, which almost entirely consists of Round Goby. Our results provide further support that recent increases in the size of Lake Ontario bass are a result of Round Goby consumption, and that the effects of this dietary shift on body condition are greater for SMB.

However, a mechanistic understanding of how leaf morphological/physiological traits effect δ (E) is missing. A laser spectrometer was coupled to a leaf-level gas-exchange system to measure fluxes and isotopic signatures of plant transpiration under controlled conditions in seven distinct species (Fagus sylvatica, Pinus sylvestris, Acacia longifolia, Quercus suber, Coffea arabica, Plantago lanceolata, Oxalis triangularis). We analyzed the role of stomatal conductance (g(s) ) and leaf water content (W) on the temporal dynamics of δ (E) following changes in relative humidity (rH). Changes in rH were applied from 60 to 30% and from 30 to 60%, which is probably more than covering the maximum step changes occurring under natural conditions. Further, the impact of g(s) and W on isotopic non-steady state isofluxes was analyzed. Following changes in rH, temporal development of δ (E) was well described by a one-pool modeling approach for most species. Isofluxes of δ (E) were dominantly driven by stomatal control on E, particularly for the initial period of 30 min following a step change. Hence, the deviation of isofluxes from isotopic steady state can be large, even though plants transpire near to isotopic steady state. Notably, not only transpiration rate and stomatal conductance, but also the leaf traits stomatal density (as a measure of g(max)) and leaf water content are significantly related to the time constant (τ) and non-steady-state isofluxes.

"Wood, Kevin A and Hayes, Richard B and England, Judy and Grey, Jonathan",2017,Invasive crayfish impacts on native fish diet and growth vary with fish life stage.,Aquatic sciences,"Assessing the impacts of invasive organisms is a major challenge in ecology. Some widespread invasive species such as crayfish are potential competitors and reciprocal predators of ecologically and recreationally important native fish species. Here, we examine the effects of signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) on the growth, diet, and trophic position of the chub (Squalius cephalus) in four rivers in Britain. Growth rates of 0+ chub were typically lower in sympatric populations with signal crayfish compared with allopatric populations, and this effect could be traced through to 2+ chub in one river. However, growth rates of older chub (5+ to 6+) were typically higher in the presence of crayfish. Sympatry with crayfish resulted in lower chub length-at-age and mass-at-age in half of the rivers sampled, with no change detected in the other rivers. Stable isotope analyses (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) revealed that both chub and crayfish were omnivorous, feeding at multiple trophic levels and occupying similar trophic positions. We found some evidence that chub trophic position was greater at invaded sites on one river, with no difference detected on a second river. Mixing models suggested crayfish were important food items for both small and large chub at invaded sites. This study provides evidence that invasive species can have both positive and negative effects on different life stages of a native species, with the net impact likely to depend on responses at the population level.",483 [pii] and 10.1007/s00027-016-0483-2 [doi],Chub Squalius cephalus and Competition and Diet shift and Invasive species and Scalimetry and Signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus and Stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

   habitat degradation. Here, we use stable isotope analyses to
   characterize the trophic structure of predator-prey interactions on
   coral reefs of the Keppel Island Group on the southern Great Barrier
   Reef, Australia. These reefs, previously typified by exceptionally high
   coral cover, have recently lost much of their coral cover due to coral
   bleaching and frequent inundation by sediment-laden, freshwater flood
   plumes associated with increased rainfall patterns. Long-term monitoring
   of these reefs demonstrates that, as coral cover declined, there has
   been a decrease in prey biomass, and a shift in dominant prey species
   from pelagic plankton-feeding damselfishes to territorial benthic
   algal-feeding damselfishes, resulting in differences in the principal
   carbon pathways in the food web. Using isotopes, we tested whether this

   natural saline inputs exacerbated by flow alteration and other
   anthropogenic impacts. Salinization in the Pecos River has been linked
   to declines in fish diversity, but impacts on the structure of aquatic
   food webs have not been investigated.
   2. We assessed variation in local food webs along the longitudinal
   gradient of the main stem Pecos River by estimating carbon sources,
   trophic positions and assemblage-wide trophic structure for aquatic
   consumers at 12 sites using stable isotope analysis (delta C-13 and
   delta N-15). Temporal variation across seasons was also examined for
   common fish species at a subset of sites.
   3. Consumer richness, food-chain length and assemblage-wide niche
   breadth were inversely related to specific conductivity. Mixing models
   revealed differences in sources of dietary carbon supporting fish
   production along the longitudinal fluvial gradient, with a shift towards
   reliance on algal production in the salinized reaches of the river.
   Trophic niche breadth was greatest for assemblages in less degraded
   sites with higher fish species richness. Local food webs in salinized
   sites were dominated by euryhaline species and had shorter food chains
   and narrower assemblage-wide niche breadths. Across seasons, delta C-13

   impact Arctic food webs remains a challenge in forecasting ecological
   responses to climate change. One top-down approach to this challenge is
   to elucidate trophic roles of consumers as either specialists (i.e.,
   consumers of predominantly one food resource) or generalists (i.e.,
   consumers of multiple food resources) to categorize the dependence of
   consumers on each primary producer. At Hanna Shoal in the Chukchi Sea,
   Alaska, we used stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data to quantify

   phytoplankton and sediment organic matter composite (PSOM), and a
   hypothesized microphytobenthos (MPB) component were incorporated by
   consumers in the benthic food web, but their importance varied by
   species. Some primary consumers relied heavily on PSOM (e.g, the

   regime) influences the structure of aquatic communities in northern

   and aquatic community structure during a natural flooding event in an
   Alaskan fen where water-table position had been manipulated in three
   large-scale experimental plots during previous years to simulate both
   drought (lowered water-table treatment) and flooding (raised water-table
   treatment) conditions relative to a control without manipulation.
   Although the natural flood disrupted the long-term experimental
   manipulation, it provided an opportunity to evaluate how variation in
   past hydrologic regime influences nutrient dynamics and aquatic food web
   structure during periods of inundation in a northern boreal peatland.
   Despite similar water depth among experimental plots during the time of
   sampling (i.e. water was above the peat surface in all plots),
   water-column nutrient concentrations were significantly greater in the
   drought treatment (where water table had been lowered during the
   previous growing season) compared to the raised water-table treatment
   and the control. Algal production increased with enhanced nutrient
   availability across all water-table treatments and was most elevated
   following the rewetting of dry sediments in the drought treatment.
   Consumer biomass (heterotrophic bacteria and macroinvertebrates)
   increased with algal production and was significantly greater in the
   drought treatment compared to the raised water-table treatment and the
   control. Consumer biomass decreased into the second year of constant
   inundation as algal production was constrained by reduced nutrient
   availability. Stable isotope analysis (C-13 and N-15) showed that
   elevated levels of periphyton (i.e. the intact biofilm) associated with
   enhanced nutrient availability promoted energy transfer to higher
   trophic levels (grazers and predators) rather than living or dead mosses
   or vascular plant material. Consumption of algal material by grazers
   altered the size and composition of the algal community. The algal
   community shifted from coccoid (edible) to filamentous (inedible) growth
   forms with increased grazer abundance in the drought treatment, possibly
   owing to selective grazing. Conversely, there was a similar proportion
   of edible and inedible taxa in the control and raised treatments where
   grazers were lower in abundance. Our results show that the legacy
   effects of drought can regulate aquatic community structure in northern
   peatlands. Within a predictive context, our findings suggest that
   conditions of more variable hydrology expected with climate change (i.e.
   increased frequency of drought) occurring across northern latitudes will

   application. Using a laboratory-based dual stable isotope tracer

   Limnomysis benedeni from Lake Constance. We provide delta N-15 and delta

   Kwando River experiences small and unreliable floods. During years of
   exceptional flooding of the Upper Zambezi and Kavango rivers, the rivers
   are interconnected at peak flows and therefore share a common
   ichthyofauna. This provided a natural experiment to investigate the
   responses of fish communities comprised of the same species to differing
   flood regimes by comparing the fish assemblages and food-web structures
   between rivers.
   2. Fish assemblage structure was characterised by analysing biomass
   catch per unit effort data collected using gillnets in all water-level
   seasons for all three rivers. Whole ecosystem-stable isotope data
   collected once from each river were used to examine differences in
   food-web structure and fish feeding ecology between rivers. Due to
   temporal differences in hydrology, the Upper Zambezi and Kavango river
   food webs were characterised during the low and falling water seasons,
   while the Kwando River food web was sampled during the rising water
   season.
   3. In the Upper Zambezi and Kavango rivers, fish assemblages varied with
   hydrological season due to the homogenising influence of the flood
   pulse, while in the Kwando River fish assemblages did not change
   seasonally.
   4. The Upper Zambezi River food web had a restricted nitrogen range
   (NR=0.90), with a reduced food chain length and predators did not occupy
   elevated trophic positions compared to those in the Kavango and Kwando
   river food webs (NR=1.05 and 0.97 respectively). The Kwando and Kavango
   rivers are less exploited than the heavily fished Upper Zambezi River,
   where fishing has reduced the abundance of primary and tertiary
   consumers, potentially resulting in the observed reduction in food chain
   length. The Upper Zambezi and Kavango river food webs were based on
   differing basal resources compared to the Kwando River food web. The
   Upper Zambezi and Kavango river food webs were likely supported by
   C-13-enriched resources such as C4 riparian vegetation fromthe
   floodplain, while the Kwando River food web was likely based on
   C-13-depleted resources such as filamentous algae and aquatic
   macrophytes.
   5. The influence of the varying flood pulses on the fish communities of
   these three rivers supports the flood pulse concept. There is also
   evidence that food-web structures differ between rivers but, due to
   differing hydrological regimes in the rivers, further study is required
   to understand causal factors. These ecosystems are increasingly impacted
   by human population growth and development, as well as climate change,
   and improved predictions in fish community and food-web structure in
   relation to flood pulse changes are important for ecosystem management
   in future.",10.1111/fwb.13032,"fish assemblage structure; fish community composition; flood pulse

   shifts in American silver perch Bairdiella chrysoura over a 30-yr period
   characterized by strong changes in its population size and habitats
   within the Terminos Lagoon (Mexico). We first compared the otolith SOM
   isotopic signatures from present-clay adults to those of muscle and the
   main local prey. Our results suggest that otolith SOM can be confidently
   extracted and analyzed for both present and past otoliths of this
   species. The mean otolith SOM signatures obtained (-15.92 +/- 1.35\%,
   for delta C-13 and 9.38 +/- 0.93\%, for delta N-15) were consistent with
   those of the diet as 85\% of the individual signatures were included
   within the prey isotopic niche area. Moreover, this study supports a
   trophic enrichment factor between diet and otolith (TEFdiet-otolith)
   close to 0 for delta N-15, while for delta C-13, the TEFololith-muscle
   of +0.02\% warrants further investigation. Then, we compared past and
   contemporary otolith SOM signatures to investigate temporal diet shifts
   in B. chrysoura. This showed that 613C and delta N-15 differed
   significantly between the past and present period even if the temporal
   shift remained relatively small (respectively +1.17\%, and 0.55\%). The

   elemental or macromolecular tracers of food web structure. For example,
   inferences about food chain length are often made using stable isotope
   ratios of top predators and consumer food sources are often inferred
   from both stable isotopes and fatty acid (FA) content in consumer
   tissues. The use of FAs as tracers implies some degree of macromolecular
   conservation across trophic interactions, but many FAs are subject to
   physiological alteration and animals may produce those FAs from
   precursors in response to food deficiencies. We measured 41 individual
   FAs and several aggregate FA metrics in two filter-feeding taxa to (1)
   assess ecological variation in food availability and (2) identify
   potential drivers of among-site variation in FA content. These taxa were
   filter feeding caddisflies (Family Hydropyschidae) and dreissenid
   mussels (Genus Dreissena), which both consume seston. Stable isotopic
   composition (C and N) in these taxa co-varied across 13 sites in the
   Great Lakes region of North America, indicating they fed on very similar
   food resources. However, co-variation in FA content was very limited,
   with only one common FA co-varying across this gradient (alpha-linolenic
   acid; ALA), suggesting these taxa accumulate FAs very differently even
   when exposed to the same foods. Based on these results, among-site

   isotopes. During August and September of 2012 and 2013,16 common fish
   species and two primary, invertebrate consumers were collected from
   surface, midwater and bottom trawls within the eastern Chukchi Sea.
   Linear mixed-effects models were used to detect possible variation in

   values among water masses and years for 13 fish species with an emphasis
   on Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida). We also examined the fish community
   isotopic niche space, trophic redundancy, and trophic separation within
   each water mass as measures of resiliency of the fish food web.
   Ontogenetic shifts in trophic level and diet were observed for most
   species and these changes tended to vary by water mass. As they
   increased in length, most fish species relied more on benthic prey with
   the exception of three forage fish species (walleye pollock, Gadus
   chalcogrammus, capelin, Mallotus villosus, and Pacific sandlance,
   Ammodytes hexapterus). Species that exhibited interannual differences in
   diet and trophic level were feeding at lower trophic levels and consumed
   a more pelagic diet in 2012 when zooplankton densities were higher. Fish
   communities occupied different isotopic niche spaces depending on water
   mass association. In more northerly Arctic waters, the fish community
   occupied the smallest isotopic niche space and relied heavily on a
   limited range of intermediate delta C-13 prey, whereas in warmer,
   nutrient-rich Bering Chukchi Summer Water, pelagic prey was important.
   In the warmest, Pacific-derived coastal water, fish consumed both

   than in LS (8355 ind. m-2 and 2110 mg C m(-2)). This was attributed to
   higher particulate organic matter fluxes to seafloor in NOW. Polychaetes
   were significant taxa at both sites in terms of density and biomass, and
   in addition crustacean density in NOW and bivalve density in LS were
   high. Facultative filter and surface deposit feeders were highly

   matter at the sites, and an isotope mixing model confirmed phytoplankton
   as the main food source for most taxa and feeding guilds. The food web
   length in LS was longer than in NOW (3.2 vs. 2.8 trophic levels). This
   was attributed to a larger reliance on reworked organic matter by the
   benthic community in LS, whereas the high export fluxes at the highly
   productive NOW resulted in higher rates of selective consumption of
   fresh algal matter. Despite studies suggesting that loss of ice algae
   from consumer diets in the Arctic might have a negative impact on the

   composition and in stable isotope values. We also observed a trend of
   decreasing carbon stable isotopes in crabs from the Chukchi to those in
   the Canadian Beaufort, likely reflecting the increasing use of
   terrestrial carbon sources towards the eastern regions of the Beaufort
   Sea from Mackenzie River influx. Cannibalism on snow crabs was higher in
   the Chukchi regions relative to the Beaufort regions. We suggest that
   cannibalism may have an impact on recruitment in the Chukchi Sea via
   reduction of cohort strength after settlement to the benthos, as known
   from the Canadian Atlantic. Prey composition varied with crab size only
   in some size classes in the southern Chukchi and central Beaufort, while
   stable isotope results showed no size-dependent differences. Slightly
   although significantly higher mean carbon isotope values for males in
   the southern Chukchi may not be reflective of a gender-specific pattern
   but rather be driven by low sample size. Finally, the lack of prey
   selection relative to availability in crabs in the southern Chukchi
   suggests that crabs consume individual prey taxa in relative proportions
   to prey field abundances. The present study is the first to provide a
   baseline of the omnivorous role of snow crabs across the entire Pacific
   Arctic, as well as evidence for cannibalism in the Chukchi Sea. In light
   of climate change predictions for the Alaska Arctic, and the potential
   for future fisheries harvest of snow crabs in this region, continued
   monitoring of snow crabs, including population and trophic dynamics, is
   increasingly important to assess snow crab impacts on benthic
   communities and vice versa. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.dsr2.2015.11.009,Beaufort Sea; Cannibalism; Chukchi Sea; Diet; Snow crab; Stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

   bacterial carbon sources in a shallow Dutch lake",LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,"Ecosystem metabolism of lakes strongly depends on the relative
   importance of local vs. allochthonous carbon sources and on microbial
   food-web functioning and structure. Over the year ecosystem metabolism
   varies as a result of seasonal changes in environmental parameters such
   as nutrient levels, light, temperature, and variability in the food web.
   This is reflected in isotopic compositions of phytoplankton and
   bacteria. Here, we present the results of a 17-month study on carbon
   dynamics in two basins of Lake Naarden, The Netherlands. One basin was
   restored after anthropogenic eutrophication, whereas the other basin
   remained eutrophic. We analyzed natural stable carbon isotope abundances
   (C-13) of dissolved inorganic carbon, dissolved organic carbon and
   macrophytes, and combined these data with compound-specific C-13
   analyses of phospholipid-derived fatty acids, produced by phytoplankton
   and bacteria. Isotopic fractionation (epsilon) between phytoplankton
   biomass and CO2(aq) was similar for diatoms and other eukaryotic
   phytoplankton, and differences between sampling sites were small.
   Highest epsilon values were observed in winter with values of 23.5 +/-
   0.6 parts per thousand for eukaryotic phytoplankton and 13.6 +/- 0.3
   parts per thousand for cyanobacteria. Lowest epsilon values were
   observed in summer: 10.5 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand for eukaryotic
   phytoplankton and 2.7 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand for cyanobacteria. The
   annual range in C-13(bact) was between 6.9 parts per thousand and 8.2
   parts per thousand for the restored and eutrophic basin, respectively,
   while this range was between 11.6 parts per thousand and 13.1 parts per
   thousand for phytoplankton in the restored and eutrophic basin,
   respectively. Correlations between C-13(phyto) and C-13(bact) were
   strong at both sites. During summer and fall, bacterial biomass derives
   mainly from locally produced organic matter, with minor allochthonous
   contributions. Conversely, during winter, bacterial dependence on

   a critically endangered seabird during the non-breeding season",DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,"Aim The movement patterns of marine top predators are likely to reflect
   responses to prey distributions, which themselves can be influenced by
   factors such as climate and fisheries. The critically endangered
   Balearic shearwater Puffinus mauretanicus has shown a recent northwards
   shift in non-breeding distribution, tentatively linked to changing
   forage fish distribution and/or fisheries activity. Here, we provide the
   first information on the foraging ecology of this species during the
   non-breeding period.
   Location Breeding grounds in Mallorca, Spain, and non-breeding areas in
   the north-east Atlantic and western Mediterranean.
   Methods Birdborne geolocation was used to identify non-breeding grounds.
   Information on feather moult (from digital images) and stable isotopes
   (of both primary wing feathers and potential prey items) was combined to
   infer foraging behaviour during the non-breeding season.
   Results Almost all breeding shearwaters (n = 32) migrated to
   non-breeding areas in the Atlantic from southern Iberia to the French
   Atlantic coast, where the majority of primary feather moult took place.
   Birds foraging off western Iberia yielded feather isotope ratios
   consistent with a diet composed largely of pelagic fishes, while the
   isotopic composition of birds foraging in the Bay of Biscay suggested an
   additional contribution of benthic prey, most likely from demersal
   fishery discards.
   Main conclusions Combined application of geolocators and stable isotopes
   indicates spatial variation in dietary behaviour and interactions with
   fisheries. Our results imply that both pelagic fish and fisheries
   discards are important components of diet during the non-breeding
   period, which may have implications for the at-sea distribution of this
   migratory species. These findings will contribute to bycatch mitigation
   in non-breeding areas and provide baseline data that should inform

   tissue, once the baseline isotopic variability has been accounted for.
   Our study established the first data-driven baseline delta N-15 isoscape

   matter. Bulk delta N-15 analysis on 1039 muscle tissue of bigeye and
   yellowfin tuna were conducted together with amino acid compound-specific

   particulate organic matter and tuna bulk delta N-15 values varied by
   more than 10 parts per thousand across the study area. Fine-scaled
   trophic position maps were constructed and revealed higher tuna trophic
   position (by similar to 1) in the southern latitudes compared to the
   equator. AA-CSIA confirmed these spatial patterns for bigeye and, to a
   lesser extent, yellowfin tuna. Using generalized additive models,
   spatial variations of tuna trophic positions were mainly related to the
   depth of the 20 degrees C isotherm, a proxy for the thermocline
   behavior, with higher tuna trophic position estimates at greater
   thermocline depths. We hypothesized that a deeper thermocline would
   increase tuna vertical habitat and access to mesopelagic prey of higher
   trophic position. Archival tagging data further suggested that the
   vertical habitat of bigeye tuna was deeper in the southern latitudes

   controlled contexts, the Early Formative period site of La Consentida
   was occupied between 1950 and 1550 cal BCE. In addition to evidence of
   early pottery and mounded earthen architecture, this site has produced
   fourteen sets of human remains in twelve discrete burials. The people of
   La Consentida lived and died during a period of key socioeconomic
   transitions including the establishment of sedentary villages, a shift
   toward agriculture, and the origins of formalized social inequality. In
   this paper, we discuss the archaeological context of La Consentida's
   burials and the results of bioarchaeological and stable isotopic
   analyses of human and faunal remains from the site. Stable isotope
   values and paleopathological data suggest significant maize consumption
   concurrent with increasing dental attrition. Considered alongside
   changes in food processing tools, this pattern suggests a culinary
   transition regarding maize use. Burial goods and associated features
   (including a ceremonial cache containing faunal remains, ceramics, and a
   musical instrument) shed light on mortuary practices. As some of

   across >3 million km(2) of the tropical and subtropical eastern Pacific
   Ocean and their trophic ecology in open ocean areas has not yet been
   adequately described. Individuals feed within biogeographic regions
   where varying nutrient cycling regimes result in phytoplankton with
   distinct delta C-13 and delta N-15 values that are assimilated by the
   turtles. We sampled 346 turtles at-sea between 2003 and 2009 and used
   bulk tissue (n = 346) and amino acid compound specific isotope analysis
   (AA-CSIA, n = 31) to empirically support the conventional understanding
   that olive ridleys are omnivores. Bulk delta N-15 values did not
   significantly vary with carapace length, a proxy for age, or with
   putative sex of adults. We therefore hypothesize that trophic position
   (TP) does not vary across age or sex. In line with other isotopic
   studies of this biogeographic scale in the same region, we observed a
   trend of bulk tissue N-15 enrichment with increasing latitude. Using
   AA-CSIA to account for delta N-15 baseline shifts among food webs
   (space), we estimated the TP of adult foragers using two methods. We
   found that across their eastern Pacific range, olive ridley delta C-13
   and delta N-15 niche area varied, but median TP of adults remained
   constant (similar to 3.1). Using a two-amino acid TP estimation method,

   persistence through time of the Chisel-toothed kangaroo rat",FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,"1. Rapid environmental changes are putting many species at risk,
   particularly niche specialists. In response, species can shift their
   ranges or remain in place by taking advantage of new resources. The
   potential for specialists to undergo insitu niche shifts is not well
   understood yet can buffer species from the effects of long-term
   environmental change over centuries and millennia.
   2. In the Great Basin of western North America, the Chisel-toothed
   kangaroo rat, Dipodomys microps, is a folivore thought to be an obligate
   specialist on the desert shrub Atriplex confertifolia. Because of its
   association with A. confertifolia, D. microps is presumed to have
   tracked the shrub as it moved south during the last glacial maximum.
   However, recent phylogeographic evidence indicates that D. microps did
   not shift or contract its range into a southern refugium.
   3. Here we evaluate the role that niche flexibility may have played in
   allowing this presumed dietary specialist to cope with a changing
   environment and resource base. We do so using carbon and nitrogen
   isotopes measured in D. microps bone collagen from modern and fossil
   specimens spanning the last 8000years at Two Ledges Chamber (TLC) in
   northwestern Nevada.
   4.delta C-13 values indicate that, contrary to expectation, the
   population of D. microps at TLC consumes a variety of plants other than
   A. confertifolia, an isotopically distinct C4 shrub, and has done so for
   millennia. Mixing models suggest that the proportion of C4 in the diet
   was highest (similar to 35\%) in the middle Holocene, and has declined
   towards the recent, especially over the last 30years. delta N-15 values
   are consistently elevated through time, suggesting that D.microps at TLC
   are potentially also consuming a high proportion of insects.
   5. Our results indicate that this population of dietary specialists has
   greater niche flexibility than previously assumed. This implies that, at
   the species level, even presumed niche specialists may be capable of
   undergoing niche shifts over centennial to millennial time-scales in
   response to changing environmental conditions, and highlights the unique

   Alien Species in the Mediterranean Sea. However, its trophic role and
   feeding flexibility in invaded benthic food webs have been addressed
   only recently. Here, field samplings were conducted in winter and summer
   in five coastal systems of the Apulia region (SE Italy), three located
   on the Ionian Sea (Mar Piccolo, Torre Colimena, and Spunderati) and two
   on the Adriatic Sea (Acquatina and Alimini Grande). Captured blue crabs
   were weighed and had their delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotopic signatures
   measured; their trophic level (TL) was estimated using the mussel
   Mytilus galloprovincialis as isotopic baseline.
   C. sapidus abundances varied greatly across systems and seasons, and in
   Adriatic systems the species was not collected in winter. Trophic levels
   showed significant spatial and temporal variations, although with no
   general pattern. In winter, the Mar Piccolo population showed the
   highest TL values; the lowest estimates were in Torre Colimena and
   Spunderati, where crabs showed delta C-13 signatures significantly
   higher than mussels, suggesting the contribution of C-13-enriched plant
   material in the diet. In summer, with the exception of the Mar Piccolo,
   Ionian populations increased their trophic level; both Adriatic
   populations were characterized by the lowest TL estimates. The analysis
   performed at the individual scale further indicated body weight-related
   changes in trophic level. For the Torre Colimena population, in
   particular, a hump-shaped pattern was observed in both seasons. The
   present study highlighted a considerable spatial and temporal trophic
   flexibility of C. sapidus at the population scale, while at the
   individual scale size-related shifts in trophic level were observed. The
   ability of the blue crab to vary its energy sources in relation with
   season, local environmental conditions, and ontogenetic stage is

Invasion-mediated vegetation changes can depress terrestrial arthropod communities and alter arthropod flux across the aquatic-terrestrial interface. We investigated the effects of a non-native woody plant, Robinia neomexicana, on insect contributions to riparian songbird diets. This plant was introduced over 100 years ago to the Clear Creek drainage in northwestern Colorado (USA) from its native range, which extends into southern Colorado. We used stable isotope analysis of insects and avian feces to 1) assess whether the relative contributions of aquatic- and terrestrial-derived arthropod prey differed between reference sites and sites invaded by R. neomexicana, and 2) quantify the amount of aquatic- and terrestrial-derived resources consumed by an insectivorous songbird assemblage. Two species of insectivorous songbirds consumed more aquatic insects in invaded sites compared to reference sites. This change in terrestrial- and aquatic-derived prey in bird diets in response to a near-range plant invasion suggests that the introduction of novel species from more distant native ranges could produce similar or stronger effects. Overall, the songbird community consumed approximately 34% aquatic resources, which highlights the importance of these subsidies to riparian consumers.

Results provide evidence that early Neolithic individuals, which were genetically characterised as Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, relied on wild resources to a greater extent than those whose genomic attributes were of typical Neolithic European farmers.

Beyond direct consumption, predators can affect communities indirectly by creating or altering food web linkages among existing species. Where invasive predators consume prey from multiple distinct resource channels, novel links may couple the dynamics of disjunct modules and create indirect interactions between them. Our study focuses on invasive populations of Eleutherodactylus coqui (Anura: Leptodactylidae) on Hawaii Island. Coqui actively forage in the understory and lower canopy at night but return to the forest floor and belowground retreats by day. Recent dietary studies using gut contents and naturally occurring stable isotopes indicate higher than expected consumption of litter arthropods, which in these Hawaiian forests are primarily non-native species. We used laboratory studies to observe diurnal and nocturnal foraging behavior, and experimental field additions of C4 vegetation as a litter tracer to distinguish epigaeic sources from food web pools in the C3 canopy. Lab trials revealed that prey consumption during diurnal foraging was half that consumed during nocturnal foraging. Analysis of δ13C isotopes showed incorporation of C4 carbon into litter arthropods within one month, and Bayesian mixing models estimated that 15-25% of the carbon in coqui tissue was derived from litter sources. These results support recent findings that E. coqui are not quiescent diurnally but instead actively forage. Such activity by a mobile invasive predator may introduce a novel linkage that integrates detrital and foliar resource pools, potentially distributing influences of invasive litter arthropods through the broader system to amplify impacts on native species.",PONE-D-18-07167 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0201883 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, particularly in streams, microbial functions vary significantly with the structure of the streambed, that is the distribution and spatial arrangement of sediment grains in the streambed. It is therefore essential to elucidate how environmental factors synergistically define the microbial turnover of terrestrial organic matter in order to better understand the ecological role of photo-heterotrophic interactions in stream ecosystem processes. In outdoor experimental streams, we examined how the structure of streambeds modifies the influence of light availability on microbial turnover of leaf carbon (C). Furthermore, we investigated whether the studied relationships of microbial leaf C turnover to environmental conditions are affected by flow intermittency commonly occurring in streams. We applied leaves enriched with a (13)C-stable isotope tracer and combined quantitative and isotope analyses. We thereby elucidated whether treatment induced changes in C turnover were associated with altered use of leaf C within the microbial food web. Moreover, isotope analyses were combined with measurements of microbial community composition to determine whether changes in community function were associated with a change in community composition. In this study, we present evidence, that environmental factors interactively determine how phototrophs and heterotrophs contribute to leaf C turnover. Light availability promoted the utilization of leaf C within the microbial food web, which was likely associated with a promoted availability of highly bioavailable metabolites of phototrophic origin. However, our results additionally confirm that the structure of the streambed modifies light-related changes in microbial C turnover. From our observations, we conclude that the streambed structure influences the strength of photo-heterotrophic interactions by defining the spatial availability of algal metabolites in the streambed and the composition of microbial communities.

To investigate the diet of the barnacle Amphibalanus eburneus, a dominant suspension feeder within the Indian River Lagoon (IRL) of central Florida, we compared the stable isotopes ratios (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) of barnacle tissue to those of particulate organic matter (POM). Collections were carried out quarterly for a year from 29 permanent sites and at sites impacted by an Aureoumbra lagunensis bloom. δ(13)C and δ(15)N values of Amphibalanus eburneus varied across sites, but δ(15)N was more stable over time. There was a range of δ(15)N values of Amphibalanus eburneus tissue from 6.0‰ to 10.5‰ across sites. Because land-based sources such as sewage are generally enriched in (15)N, this suggests a continuum of anthropogenic influence across sites in the IRL. Over 70% of the variation in δ(15)N values of Amphibalanus eburneus across sites was driven by the δ(15)N values of POM, supporting a generalist feeding strategy on available sources of suspended organic matter. The dominance of this generalist consumer in the IRL may be linked to its ability to consume spatially and temporally variable food resources derived from natural and anthropogenic sources, as well as Aureoumbra lagunensis cells.

   region, where endemic species characterised by restricted natural ranges
   may be at high risk of extinction. The largemouth bass (Micropterus
   salmoides) is native to North America but is invasive in the Italian
   Peninsula. The aim of this study was to explore the trophic position of
   M.salmoides, its diet and niche overlap with native fish species in the
   littoral areas of a Mediterranean lake. Our study was supported by
   analysis of stable C and N isotopes in the tissues of fish and their
   potential food sources, twenty years after the introduction of the
   largemouth bass to Lake Bracciano (Italy). Samples were collected in
   locations varying in terms of physical structure and resource
   availability at lower trophic levels in the food web, which was greater
   in the southern (hereafter: South) than in the northern (hereafter:
   North) area of the lake. These differences made it possible to explore
   the mechanisms linking environmental conditions and the role of alien
   predators in the invaded food web. The abundance of M.salmoides was
   higher, and the diversity of native fish species was lower, in North
   than South. In North, M.salmoides had a piscivorous diet and occupied a
   higher trophic position in the food web than in South, where
   invertebrates constituted an important part of its diet. As a
   consequence, trophic niche interference with other fish species at
   intermediate trophic levels was higher in South. In contrast, in North,
   M.salmoides showed stronger trophic interference with the percid Perca
   fluviatilis, a native top predator in the food web, but weaker
   interference with remaining fish species. Our results help to understand
   the role of alien species in the food webs of Lake Bracciano, which
   primarily depends on the habitat and the availability of prey across
   trophic levels. Physical and ecological variations in the habitat were
   associated with differences in predatory interactions among native and
   alien fish species. This suggests that a reduction in productivity and

   pathways of energy resources in community ecology and to identify
   determinants of ecosystem changes. Yet, little is known from rivers of
   African savanna receiving large inputs of terrestrial organic matter and

   2. We used Stable Isotope (delta C-13 and delta N-15) Bayesian Ellipses
   in R (SIBER) and Layman's community-wide metrics to describe seasonal
   variation in trophic niches and trophic structures in midorder river
   reaches in the Mara River (Kenya) that differed in environmental
   conditions (agricultural vs. forested) and amounts of organic matter and
   nutrients (low vs. high inputs by livestock and hippopotami,
   Hippopotamus amphibius). These analyses were supplemented with data on
   the trophic diversity of macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups
   (FFGs) and fish trophic guilds.
   3. The delta C-13 and delta N-15 of basal resources and consumers
   differed between sites and changed with seasons. Sites in agricultural
   areas that were utilised by livestock and a site with hippopotami had
   higher delta C-13 than the forested site due to the presence of C4
   carbon from egestion and excretion by the grazers.
   4. The forested site recorded the most taxon-rich and trophic-diverse
   invertebrate community, suggesting both autochthonous and allochthonous
   sources of energy were available. Agricultural sites and the site with
   hippopotami recorded high abundances of collector taxa in response to
   large inputs of organic matter. Fish trophic guilds were less diverse
   and were dominated by insectivores.
   5. The food web at the forested site had the widest trophic niche size
   and highest isotopic trophic diversity compared to sites in areas with
   large mammalian herbivores. Invertebrate and fish trophic niche sizes
   changed according to food resources varying with space and time.
   Invertebrates had higher delta C-13 values during the dry season. In
   contrast, fish showed higher delta C-13 values during the wet season,

   To better understand the importance of ice algae-produced carbon for the

   and stable isotope compositions of 10 zooplankton species, and their
   potential sympagic and pelagic carbon sources. FA-specific carbon stable
   isotope compositions were used in stable isotope mixing models to
   quantify the contribution of ice algae-produced carbon ((Ice)) to the
   body carbon of each species. Mean (Ice) estimates ranged from 4\% to
   67\%, with large variations between species and depending on the FA used
   for the modelling. Integrating the (Ice) estimates from all models, the
   sympagic amphipod Eusirus laticarpus was the most dependent on ice algal
   carbon ((Ice): 54\%-67\%), and the salp Salpa thompsoni showed the least

   shift in riparian consumers in areas illuminated by artificial light at
   night (ALAN). We measured the contribution of aquatic-derived carbon to
   diets in riparian arthropods in experimentally lit and unlit sites along

   versus 21\%). In contrast, isotopic signatures for P. clercki (0.3 parts
   per thousand) and Pardosa prativaga (0.7 parts per thousand) indicated a

   impart stability on food webs through the use of readily available,
   alternative energy pools. In lakes, generalist fish species may take
   advantage of spatially and temporally variable prey by consuming both
   benthic and pelagic prey to meet their energy demands. Using stomach
   content and stable isotope analyses, we examined the feeding habits of
   fish species in Alaska's Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP) lakes to determine
   the prevalence of generalist feeding strategies as a mechanism for
   persistence in extreme environments (e.g. low productivity, extreme cold
   and short growing season). Generalist and flexible feeding strategies
   were evident in five common fish species. Fish fed on benthic and
   pelagic (or nektonic) prey and across trophic levels. Three species were
   clearly omnivorous, feeding on fish and their shared invertebrate prey.
   Dietary differences based on stomach content analysis often exceeded
   70\%, and overlap in dietary niches based on shared isotopic space
   varied from zero to 40\%. Metrics of community-wide trophic structure
   varied with the number and identity of species involved and on the
   dietary overlap and niche size of individual fishes. Accumulation of
   energy from shared carbon sources by Arctic fishes creates redundancy in
   food webs, increasing likely resistance to perturbations or stochastic
   events. Therefore, the generalist and omnivorous feeding strategies
   employed by ACP fish may maintain energy flow and food web stability in
   extreme environments.",10.1111/eff.12391,"dietary niche; food web; overlap; SIBER; stable isotopes; stomach

   increasingly well described, but impacts to aquatic-terrestrial
   connectivity are largely unknown. Before and four successive years after
   dam removal, we quantified density and trophic metrics of nearshore
   tetragnathid spiders and riparian swallows and their potential
   emergent-aquatic insect prey at two experimental reaches located within
   the former impoundment (one unrestored, one with channel restoration)
   and one control reach above an intact lowhead dam. We observed
   substantial annual variability in response variables; however, few
   patterns appear to be strongly linked to dam removal. We found
   negligible changes in emergent-insect biomass or community structure,
   although there were slight changes in the relative abundance of feeding
   modes (e.g., increased predators, decreased collector-gatherers). The
   most pronounced response was a similar to 9.9 times average decline in
   spider densities after dam removal at the restored reach. Stable-isotope
   analysis (C-13, N-15) indicated that changes in aquatically-derived
   energy (i.e., nutritional subsidies derived from aquatic primary
   producers) to riparian consumers generally showed comparable patterns
   system-wide; swallow aquatically-derived energy declined more in the
   restored vs. control reach by the final year of the study. Trophic
   position (TP) of spiders showed little change post-dam removal, while
   swallow TP converged slightly between control and experimental reaches
   after dam removal. Collectively, we interpret our results as evidence
   that lowhead dam removal can prompt relatively nuanced shifts in
   aquatic-terrestrial trophic dynamics, regardless of intensive
   channel-restoration activities. In contrast, we found that broader-scale
   forcings (e.g., discharge, regional temperature) may be more influential
   in governing cross-boundary trophic interactions than the perturbations

   Depths (shallow: 100 m, middle: 300 m, and deep: 600 m) in three

   trophic values. Depth affected the delta N-15 of all trophic groups and
   the FA compositions of suspension feeders. Deeper samples had a higher
   delta N-15 and showed a greater proportion of mono- and saturated fatty
   acids, reflecting greater remineralization of SPM and of food reaching
   the seafloor. Region affected the delta C-13 and FA values of SPM,

   between the interisland and open ocean regions. This was probably linked

   invading North American wetlands, and the species has been shown to
   alter hydrology and impact aquatic organisms. Clear Creek Wildlife
   Management Area, in Kentucky, is heavily impacted by Phragmites
   invasion. Portions of the Wildlife Management Area with Phragmites were
   treated with herbicide to restore wetland flora, and in this study, we
   evaluated the effects of both the presence and management of Phragmites
   on wildlife populations and ecosystem function. We selected 3 locations
   (treated Phragmites, untreated Phragmites, and Phragmites-free) and
   surveyed each for water chemistry, wildlife populations, and
   stable-isotope signatures over a 2-y period. Water chemistry varied with
   the presence or absence of Phragmites, suggesting differences in
   nutrient cycling. Fish diversity did not differ among sites, but
   individual species varied in distribution and abundance between the
   Phragmites sites and the Phragmites-free site. Turtles showed
   significant differences in both diversity and body size based on the

   We recorded 8 Kentucky Species of Greatest Conservation Need, but there

   Stable-isotope analysis revealed variation in food-web structure based

   had little effect on fish and herpetofaunal communities in the short
   term, but potentially significant ecological changes may occur if
   Phragmites were eradicated. Our conclusions highlight the importance of
   monitoring habitat restoration to guide future management. A holistic,

   interactions between sedentary agriculturalists and nomadic pastoralists
   during the Eastern Zhou Period (770-256 BC). The previous pattern of
   multiple cultures and diverse ethnic groups has been transformed to the
   increasingly dominated cultural system of Central Plain since the middle

   spectrometry",RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY,"RationaleMethodsOtoliths are usually used to estimate the age of fish
   and the chemical composition such as nitrogen stable isotope ratios
   (N-15 values) may record environmental information and ecological role
   of the fish. However, the isotopic fractionation of N-15 values between
   diets and otoliths has rarely been investigated and remains unclear.
   Nitrogen isotopic fractionation between five different diets (N-15(diet)
   values) and otoliths (N-15(oto) values) were elucidated in tilapia
   Oreochromis mossambica reared in controlled feeding experiments. The
   otoliths were dissolved with hydrogen chloride and peroxodisulfate was
   used to oxidize the total organic materials to nitrate, which was
   further converted into N2O gas by denitrification bacteria before the
   measurement of N-15(oto) values by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The
   N-15 values of muscles, gills, scales and livers of the tilapias were
   also measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry.
   ResultsConclusionsThe peroxodisulfate oxidation-bacterial conversion
   method reduced the minimum mass of the otoliths required for analysis to
   as low as 2mg, unlike past methods, which have required masses of
   8-155mg. The N-15(oto) values were not significantly different from the
   N-15(diet) values of the five diets. Furthermore, the somatic growth
   rate had no effect on the N-15(oto) values. Nevertheless, the N-15
   values of metabolically active tissues were significantly different from
   each other and higher than the N-15(diet) values, due to the deamination
   of these tissues.
   These results suggest that diet was the main source of amino acids for
   the otolith organic matrix and there was no biochemical transamination
   during the assimilation of dietary amino acids to otoliths. The
   N-15(oto) value can be used as a proxy of nitrogen sources of fishes and
   may have potential application in ecological studies such as the
   detection of diet shift, migration, trophic levels and environmental

   benthic macrofauna caused by invasive cordgrass",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"1. Ecological replacement using native mangrove species combined with
   physical treatments has become an effective method in controlling the
   spread of invasive cordgrass Spartina alterniflora. To re-establish
   ecosystem functions, trophic interactions between macrofauna and their
   potential food resources must be considered during the restoration
   process.
   2. Here, we examined the changes in the diets of macrofauna in three
   restored mangrove ecosystems with different invasion histories following
   the removal of S.alterniflora in southern China. Carbon and nitrogen
   stable isotope ratios for dominant macrofauna, as well as their
   potential food sources, were analysed. The relative contributions of the
   different carbon sources to the diets of benthic macrofauna and isotopic
   niche width, including convex hull areas and standard ellipse areas of
   the macrofaunal community, were then calculated and compared among
   sampling sites in each region.
   3. Our results indicated that Spartina-derived detritus contributed to
   >80\% of the organic carbon sources of dominant macrofauna in the
   S.alterniflora communities in all three regions. Spartina alterniflora
   communities had lower convex hull areas and standard ellipse areas than
   natural mangrove forests, indicating significant resource competition
   among different consumer populations. Replacing S.alterniflora with the
   native mangrove species Kandelia obovata could reverse the diets of
   these macrofaunal species, resulting in a shift from homogeneous
   Spartina-dominated diets to more heterogeneous algae-based diets. It
   could take several decades to restore food web interactions to a
   pre-impacted state. Even the diets of macrofauna in mature mangrove
   (>40years) remained affected by the Spartina-derived organic matter.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our study reveals that the ecological
   replacement of invasive Spartina alterniflora using native mangrove
   species could restore food web function gradually. However, this removal
   and replacement approach is a long process and requires significant
   manpower and resources. Furthermore, the native ecosystem will continue
   to be influenced by the cordgrass as long as large areas of wetland
   nearby are occupied by S.alterniflora. Consequently, preventing the
   colonization of S.alterniflora should be a priority for coastal
   ecosystem management in southern China.",10.1111/1365-2664.12987,"benthic macrofauna; coastal wetland; cordgrass; diet change; ecological

   Powell Basin (northeastern AP) during the austral summers of 2013-2016.
   Mean isotope values for delta C-13 and delta N-15 values were,

   differences were found for delta C-13 values of POM samples and humpback
   whales and for delta N-15 values of POM, humpback and Antarctic minke

   web tended to be observed towards open sea regions (Powell Basin and an
   area under the influence of the Bellingshausen Sea waters). The
   isoscapes generated for the baseline of the NAP ecosystem provided
   unprecedented information, to the best of our knowledge, of how the
   delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of POM varied spatially and temporally

"Cheung, Christina and Zhang, Hua and Hepburn, Joseph C and Yang, Dongya Y and Richards, Michael P",2019,Stable isotope and dental caries data reveal abrupt changes in subsistence economy in ancient China in response to global climate change.,PloS one,"Prior to the introduction of wheat and barley from Central Asia during the Neolithic period, northern Chinese agricultural groups subsisted heavily on millet. Despite being the focus of many decades of intensive interest and research, the exact route(s), date(s), and mechanisms of the spread and adoption of wheat and barley into the existing well-established millet-based diet in northern China are still debated. As the majority of the important introduced crops are C3 plants, while the indigenous millet is C4, archaeologists can effectively identify the consumption of any introduced crops using stable carbon isotope analysis. Here we examine published stable isotope and dental caries data of human skeletal remains from 77 archaeological sites across northern and northwestern China. These sites date between 9000 to 1750 BP, encompassing the period from the beginning of agriculture to wheat's emergence as a staple crop in northern China. The aim of this study is to evaluate the implications of the spread and adoption of these crops in ancient China. Detailed analysis of human bone collagen δ13C values reveals an almost concurrent shift from a C4-based to a mixed C3/ C4- based subsistence economy across all regions at around 4500-4000 BP. This coincided with a global climatic event, Holocene Event 3 at 4200 BP, suggesting that the sudden change in subsistence economy across northern and northwestern China was likely related to climate change. Moreover, the substantially increased prevalence of dental caries from pre-to post-4000 BP indicates an increase in the consumption of cariogenic cereals during the later period. The results from this study have significant implications for understanding how the adoption of a staple crop can be indicative of large-scale environmental and socio-political changes in a region.",PONE-D-18-25664 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0218943 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we present evidence of changing aquatic food web structure in the seasons following short-duration, extreme manipulation of water levels in a reservoir (i.e., draining of the reservoir to the original riverbed during fall to assist outmigration of juvenile Chinook Salmon). We find unintended and lagged consequences of transitioning from a lake to a river, even temporarily, that resulted in trophic shifts away from piscivory and towards feeding at lower trophic levels for two common piscivorous fishes in reservoirs. Using natural abundances of nitrogen stable isotopes, we observed lower trophic level of feeding for invasive Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides) and native Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) during the summers following reservoir refilling than in nearby reference reservoirs that were not temporarily drained during fall. Declines in trophic levels of aquatic top predators have been rarely documented outside of controlled laboratory conditions. While useful for assisting outmigration of juvenile salmonids, the temporary draining of a reservoir to riverbed can also result in novel shifts in foodweb dynamics including reduced piscivory. As large dams continue to be operated and constructed worldwide, increased understanding of the community and ecosystem-level effects of reservoir management will be critical to evaluating trade-offs between human water needs, conservation of high value species, and ecosystem services impacted by river fragmentation.",PONE-D-18-17023 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0211870 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To understand contemporary species interactions, we quantified the isotopic niches, niche overlap, and ontogenetic niche change among seven dominant fish species using stable isotope analyses. Analyses used fishes from three regions differing in fish and prey diversities. Differences in fish and diet composition diversity among regions were found using Simpson's inverse diversity index. The regions of lowest diversities had higher instances of niche overlap and higher percentage of niche overlap area. The region of highest diversity had the widest spread of niches with greater distances from the community centroid. Ontogenetic shifts were observed such that larger individuals shifted towards the community centroid with the exception of Atlantic cod. Atlantic cod in particular was found to consistently be the top predator of the analyzed species.

   However, shifts in trophic niches with changes in land use are little
   studied and this applies in particular to belowground animals. Oribatid
   mites are among the most abundant soil animals, involved in
   decomposition processes and nutrient cycling. We analyzed shifts in
   trophic niches of six soil-living oribatid mite species with the
   conversion of lowland secondary rainforest into plantation systems of
   different land-use intensity (jungle rubber, rubber and oil palm
   monoculture plantation) in two regions of southwest Sumatra, Indonesia.
   We measured stable isotope ratios (C-13/C-12 and N-15/N-14) of single
   oribatid mite individuals and calculated shifts in stable isotope niches
   with changes in land use. Significant changes in stable isotope ratios
   in three of the six studied oribatid mite species indicated that these
   species shift their trophic niches with changes in land use. The trophic
   shift was either due to changes in trophic level (delta N-15 values), to
   changes in the use of basal resources (delta C-13 values) or to changes
   in both. The trophic shift generally was most pronounced between more
   natural systems (rainforest and jungle rubber) on one side and
   monoculture plantations systems (rubber and oil palm plantations) on the
   other, reflecting that the shifts were related to land-use intensity.
   Although trophic niches of the other three studied species did not
   differ significantly between land-use systems they followed a similar
   trend. Overall, the results suggest that colonization of very different
   ecosystems such as rainforest and intensively managed monoculture
   plantations by oribatid mite species likely is related to their ability

   reservoirs (The Netherlands) was examined after recent invasions of the
   quagga mussel ( Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) and round goby
   (Neogobius melanostomus), by means of stable isotope analysis. Quagga
   mussels reached relatively high densities after invasion, replacing the
   zebra mussel (D. polymorpha). The delta C-13 signatures in the food web
   showed two distinct basic signatures of primary producers: 1)
   phytoplankton and Elodea nuttallii, and 2) more enriched submerged

   zooplankton and phytoplankton. Mussel detritus seemed to be of
   importance for the gammarid Dikerogammarus spp. (both D. villosus and D.
   haemobaphes). delta N-15 as a proxy for trophic level revealed that the
   largest specimens of ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus), pike-perch (Sander

   abundance after the invasion of the highly competitive round goby. The
   altered and recent new links between species have changed the food web.

Schaefer,2019,Do agricultural pesticides in streams influence riparian spiders?,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Freshwater ecosystems are coupledwith their riparian area. Emerging
   insects are prey for predators in the riparian zone, enriching the
   terrestrial ecosystemwith energy and nutrients. Stressors associated
   with agriculture can alter insect communities in water and on land,
   resulting in complex response patterns of terrestrial predators relying
   on prey fromboth systems. Examining the effects from individual
   agricultural stressors such as pesticides is hampered in landscapes with
   intensive agriculture where multiple stressors like habitat degradation
   and typically co-occur. In rural regions of Eastern Europe, traditional
   low intensity agriculture based on working animals and human labour
   prevails alongside intensive, mechanised agriculture. Assuming that
   low-intensity agriculture relies on no or limited pesticide use, whereas
   fertilizer use is similar across different agricultural intensities,
   such regionsmay allowto study in-streampesticide effects independent
   fromother stressors, such as nutrient input or habitat degradation. We
   examined the taxonomic and trait response of riparian spider communities
   to gradients of agricultural stressors and environmental variables in
   the region around Cluj-Napoca, Romania. Pesticide sampling was done
   using passive samplers in the streams adjacent to spider sampling sites.
   To capture spiders with different traits and survival strategies, we
   used multiple collection methods. Community composition was best
   explained by in-stream pesticide toxicity and shading of the stream
   bank, a proxy for the quality of the habitat. Species richness and the
   number of spider individuals were negatively associated with in-stream
   pesticide toxicity. In contrast, mean body size and shading preference
   of spider communities responded strongest to shading, whereas mean niche
   width (habitat preference for moisture and shading) responded strongest
   to the other environmental variables. Our study suggests that in-stream
   pesticide toxicity can influence riparian communities. The
   identification of mechanisms requires further studies targeting the
   potential contributions of direct toxicity and indirect effects from
   reduced aquatic and terrestrial prey availability. (c) 2019 Elsevier

   composition of the fish consumers, while immense water body in the lower

   that: (1) macroinvertebrates and fish inhabiting areas below peaking
   hydrodams would be higher in delta N-15 and lower in delta C-13 due to
   increased flow velocity and the influence of light respired dissolved
   inorganic carbon, relative to those sampled from areas with a natural

   lead a shorter food web length in the regulated river, but delta C-13

   delta C-13, delta N-15, niche width {[}SEA(B)], and food chain length
   {[}Delta N-15]) would correlate with variations in flow characteristics
   through time. Consistent with previous analysis conducted over a shorter

   both fish and invertebrates, but, contrarily, only invertebrates (not
   fish) had a lower delta C-13 value downstream of the dam. Over the long

   headwater streams of the Val Roseg, a glacierized alpine catchment. We
   compared stable isotope (delta C-13 and delta N-15) trophic indices to
   high temporal resolution data on flow intermittency. Overall trophic
   diversity, food chain length and diversity of basal resource use did not
   differ to a large extent across streams. In contrast, gradient and
   mixing model analysis indicated that primary consumers assimilated
   proportionally more periphyton and less allochthonous organic matter in
   more intermittent streams. Higher coarse particulate organic matter
   (CPOM) C:N ratios were an additional driver of changes in
   macroinvertebrate diets. These results indicate that the trophic base of
   stream food webs shifts away from terrestrial organic matter to
   autochthonous organic matter as flow intermittency increases, most
   likely due to reduced CPOM conditioning in dry streams. This study
   highlights the significant, yet gradual shifts in ecosystem function

   and food web structure were characterised in six lakes with and six
   lakes without fish at high elevation in the southern Rocky Mountains of

   plants) to consumers including herbivores and higher trophic levels.
   Contributions of organic matter sources to macroinvertebrates were
   combined with estimates of littoral macroinvertebrate production in

   invertebrate production. Although introduced fish altered community
   composition, body size, and biomass, they did not alter contributions of

   periphyton and phytoplankton, which combined contributed to 80\% of

   composition and biomass. This suggests that changes in structure (e.g.
   biomass, community composition) associated with introduced or invasive

   study suggests that although maximum trophic position has been shown to
   increase with lake size for lakes containing fish, the pattern is

   system under normal estuarine salinity (<= 35) conditions, but are more
   constrained to Baffin Bay under hypersaline (> 35) conditions. This

   Plateau",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Pteropods are a group of small marine gastropods that are highly
   sensitive to multiple stressors associated with climate change. Their
   trophic ecology is not well studied, with most research having focused
   primarily on the effects of ocean acidification on their fragile,
   aragonite shells. Stable isotopes analysis coupled with isotope-based
   Bayesian niche metrics is useful for characterizing the trophic
   structure of biological assemblages. These approaches have not been
   implemented for pteropod assemblages. We used isotope-based Bayesian
   niche metrics to investigate the trophic relationships of three
   co-occurring pteropod species, with distinct feeding behaviors, sampled
   from the Southern Kerguelen Plateau area in the Indian Sector of the
   Southern Ocean-a biologically and economically important but poorly
   studied region. Two of these species were gymnosomes (shell-less
   pteropods), which are traditionally regarded as specialist predators on
   other pteropods, and the third species was a thecosome (shelled
   pteropod), which are typically generalist omnivores. For each species,
   we aimed to understand (a) variability and overlap among isotopic
   niches; and (b) whether there was a relationship between body size and
   trophic position. Observed isotopic niche areas were broadest for
   gymnosomes, especially Clione limacina antarctica, whose observed
   isotopic niche area was wider than expected on both delta C-13 and delta
   N-15 value axes. We also found that trophic position significantly
   increased with increasing body length for Spongiobranchaea australis. We
   found no indication of a dietary shift toward increased trophic position
   with increasing body size for Clio pyramidata f. sulcata. Trophic
   positions ranged from 2.8 to 3.5, revealing an assemblage composed of
   both primary and secondary consumer behaviors. This study provides a
   comprehensive comparative analysis on trophodynamics in Southern Ocean
   pteropod species, and supports previous studies using gut content, fatty

   availability of resources, with implications for consumer movement and
   habitat use. In coastal ecosystems, eutrophication can affect the
   production and distribution of resources, and thus the behaviors and
   space use of consumers. In this study, we coupled acoustic telemetry
   methods and stable isotope analyses (SIA) to examine the effects of
   nutrient enrichment on the movement, habitat use, and resource use of
   Common Snook (Centropomus undecimalis), a valuable recreational fishery,
   across two neighboring estuarine lake systems of varying trophic state

   Snook had more inter-zone movement events in the mesotrophic system,
   suggesting higher mobility. More specifically, increased inter-zone
   movement events were observed in the upstream and middle zones of the
   mesotrophic system where salinity and submerged aquatic vegetation was
   lower, and Chlorophyll a levels were higher. We also observed longer
   movement event durations in the eutrophic system, suggesting higher
   residency and a trend for event durations to vary across zones. Based on
   delta N-15, delta C-13 and delta S-34 analyses, we determined that
   although Snook had similar trophic levels across systems, eutrophic
   Snook relied on a greater diversity of basal sources relative to
   mesotrophic Snook. When relating movement to trophic metrics, we found
   the relationship to be zone-dependent, with higher trophic level Snook
   showing more movements into the middle and downstream zones, but less

   their feeding strategies (browsing vs. grazing) in response to climatic
   and ecological changes. However, similar studies on their Indian
   relatives are rare. In this regard, we analysed the stable carbon (delta
   C-13) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotope composition, hypsodonty indices
   (HI), and lamellae numbers of both newly recovered and existing fossil
   material (proboscideans and associated mammals) spanning the last
   similar to 14 Ma. We also obtained intra-tooth delta C-13 and delta O-18
   values of selected extant and extinct proboscideans as well as
   associated mammals to understand any intra- and inter-annual variation
   in dietary and water intake behaviour, respectively. Our results reveal
   that Middle Miocene brachydont deinotheres (ex. Deinotherium indicum)
   and bunodont gomphotheres (ex. Gomphotherium) with few cusp pairs were
   browsers living in relatively closed forests under moist conditions. By
   Late Miocene they continued browsing in relatively open forests.
   Deinotheres in the subcontinent did not survive the Late Miocene climate
   change that led to drier conditions and the spread of grasslands. The
   Late Miocene endemic forms Stegolophodon and Stegodon were browsers
   while the immigrant Choerolophodon was a mixed feeder. However, Pliocene
   gomphotheres such as bunodont Anancus and brachydont Stegodon adapted
   themselves to shrinking forests and spreading grasslands; the former
   sustained on grazing, whereas the latter showed flexibility in its diet
   ranging from browsing, mixed-feeding to pure grazing. Associated mammals
   such as rhinoceratids, giraffids, equids, and bovids responded in a
   similar manner to this climatic and ecological transition across the
   Late Miocene to Pliocene by shifting their diets accordingly. The
   Mid-Pliocene hypsodont elephantid immigrant Elephas planifrons, the
   Early Pleistocene hypsodont immigrant E. hysudricus, and Elephas

   grasslands of the subcontinent, coinciding with a shift in E. hysudricus
   diet from pure grazing to browsing. E. hysudricus likely gave rise to
   the extant E. maximus, a mixed feeder with higher contribution of browse

   and anadromy to the diet of a freshwater apex predator",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"Anadromous fishes can be important prey resources for piscivorous fauna
   in lowland rivers. Freshwater anglers exploiting large-bodied
   cypriniform fishes use high quantities of pelletised marine fishmeal
   baits that can contribute substantially to fish diets. This
   marine-derived energy pathway also potentially provides a marine prey
   resource for freshwater piscivores. However, large-bodied cypriniform
   fishes are often in a size refuge against predation due to their large
   sizes. Stable isotope (delta N-15 and delta C-13) analysis assessed how
   novel marine prey resources influenced the diet of a freshwater apex
   predator, northern pike Esox lucius, in an impounded river basin (lower
   River Severn, western England). Up to three groups of prey resources
   were present: anadromous European shad (Alosa spp.), cypriniform fishes
   with dietary specialisms based on marine fishmeal baits, and freshwater
   prey. The availability of these prey resources to E. lucius varied
   according to river connectivity and levels of angling exploitation in
   different river reaches. Where the three prey groups were present, E.
   lucius were more enriched in delta C-13 values (range: -24.74 to -16.34
   parts per thousand) compared to river reaches where aspects of the
   marine prey groups were absent (range: -28.30 to -21.47). In all
   reaches, delta C-13 increased as E. lucius length increased. In the
   reach where all prey groups were present, the isotopic niches of three
   E. lucius size categories were strongly partitioned; this was not
   apparent in reaches where the marine pathways were unavailable. Stable
   isotope mixing models suggested that freshwater prey were the most
   important prey item, contributing between 42\% and 96\% to the diet of
   individual E. lucius. However, where present, anadromous fishes and
   cypriniform fishes specialising on marine fishmeal baits were also
   important prey items, contributing substantially to the diet of larger
   E. lucius (length > 650 mm). The total dietary contributions of the
   marine resources varied considerably among the individual larger fish
   (22-58\% of total diet). The presence of two marine resource pathways in
   a lowland river thus strongly influenced the diet of an apex predator,
   but with contributions being a function of their spatial availability,
   E. lucius body size and individual trophic specialisations. These
   results emphasise how the anthropogenic activities of river engineering

   the availability of organic carbon to the detrital food webs in aquatic
   ecosystems. This may cause important shifts in ecosystem functioning
   through the functional feeding patterns of benthic organisms that rely

   subarctic lakes in Finnish Lapland across a tree line ecotone were
   analysed for limnological and optical variables, carbon (delta C-13) and

   sediment organic matter (OM) and fossil Chironomidae (Diptera) remains
   to examine environmental controls behind chironomid functional feeding

   ecosystem functioning and carbon utilisation. We hypothesise that the
   chironomid SI signatures reflect increased allochthony with increasing
   allochthonous input, but the resource use may be altered by the
   functional characteristics of the assemblage. Multivariate analyses
   indicated that carbon geochemistry in the sediments (delta C-13, delta
   N-15, C/N), nutrients, indices of productivity (chlorophyll-a) and lake
   water optical properties, related to increasing presence of OM, played a
   key role in defining the chironomid FFG composition and isotopic

   respond to environmental gradients. They showed divergent responses for
   OM quantity, dissolved organic carbon and nutrients between feeding
   strategies, suggesting that detritivores and filter feeders prefer
   contrasting carbon and nutrient conditions, and may thus hold
   paleoecological indicator potential to identify changes between
   different carbon fluxes. Benthic production was the primary carbon
   source for the chironomid assemblages according to a three-source SI

   compound-specific amino acids (delta N-15(AA)) was used as an approach
   to assess how several benthic species in this Arctic ecosystem are
   responding to the earlier timing of sea-ice melt and associated shifts
   to the onset of the annual production season. The trophic level of 16
   common benthic taxa with different feeding behaviors were collected
   along a south-to-north latitudinal gradient extending from the northern
   Bering Sea, south of St. Lawrence Island, to the northern Chukchi Sea,
   including the Barrow Canyon undersea feature, and examined with respect
   to the available food sources. The delta N-15(AA) values of source and
   trophic amino acids varied among studied regions and among species.
   delta N-15(AA)-based trophic level estimations, using delta N-15 values
   in both source and trophic amino acids and the measure of heterotrophic
   resynthesis (Sigma V parameter), provided new insights on trophic levels
   and feeding behaviors of different taxonomic groups that were not
   apparent from more commonly used isotopic measurements of bulk tissues.
   The compound-specific amino acid isotope compositions varied
   geographically, but not necessarily by latitude. This indicates that a
   simple time for space replacement perspective extending from south to
   north over the study area and reflecting variable persistence of
   seasonal sea ice, is inadequate to explain food web complexity. Highest
   bulk delta N-15 and delta N-15(AA) values were observed in depositional
   zones (near and within the St. Lawrence Island Winter-Spring Polynya, in
   particular). The delta N-15(AA) values also suggested high feeding
   plasticity in benthic species in the northern Bering and Chukchi seas
   hotspots. Benthic consumers most likely can change feeding behavior
   (e.g. suspension versus deposit feeding) in response to different
   environmental conditions and resulting changes in the quality of organic

   Understanding factors that limit the survival of hatchery-spawned fishes
   after stocking is critical to future conservation efforts using captive

   consuming other fish can influence their survival, the transition to
   piscivory by hatchery-spawned Ptychocheilus lucius Girard, 1856

   to track ontogenetic changes in the trophic position of individuals
   stocked at age 0, with the expectation that they would become fully
   piscivorous by age 2. By sampling the isotopic signatures of Colorado
   pikeminnow across multiple years, the ability of river discharge and
   densities of fish prey to explain interannual variation in trophic
   position was also explored. Annual variation in river flow and the
   densities of fish prey had little predictive power in explaining
   variation in delta N-15 of age-1 or age-2 Colorado pikeminnow. After
   assessing the isotopic signatures of potential prey, a Bayesian isotopic
   mixing model suggested that invertebrates comprised nearly 25\% of the

   harvest of living marine resources. Understanding their functioning and
   dynamics has become a growing concern in recent decades, especially
   through use of trophic modelling approaches. Studying the feeding
   ecology of key component species also improves this understanding by
   providing accurate information on trophic processes, particularly the
   dependence on trophic pathways. This study focuses on the trophic
   ecology of four large gadiforms (cod, haddock, whiting and hake) found
   on the continental shelf of the Celtic Sea. The study combines
   information on recently ingested prey (gut content analysis) and a more
   integrated indicator of food sources (stable isotope analysis). Two size
   classes of each species were considered (small and large - split around
   20 cm for haddock, whiting and hake and 60 cm for cod), as were shallow
   and deep zones. The four gadiforms show distinct feeding niches and
   strategies, which limit interspecific competition. Cod and haddock
   relied mainly on the benthic trophic pathway but differed in favouring
   piscivory and invertivory, respectively. Hake fed mainly on the pelagic
   trophic pathway, while whiting seemed to feed on both pathways.
   Ontogenetic shifts from invertivory to piscivory were observed for
   whiting in both zones and for hake and cod in the deep zone. An
   unexpected shift from the pelagic to the benthic trophic pathway was
   observed from small to large haddock in the deep zone. Taking into
   account the descriptions of diets made in adjacent ecosystems throughout
   the year, the four species show trophic plasticity towards one of the
   trophic pathways or the other. Differences between the shallow and deep
   zones were related to benthic and pelagic prey characteristics, which

"Larson, Rachel N and Brown, Justin L and Karels, Tim and Riley, Seth P D",2020,Effects of urbanization on resource use and individual specialization in coyotes (Canis latrans) in southern California.,PloS one,"Urban environments are unique because fragments of natural or semi-natural habitat are embedded within a potentially permeable matrix of human-dominated areas, creating increased landscape and, potentially, habitat heterogeneity. In addition, urban areas can provide diet subsidies for wildlife species in the form of fruiting ornamental plants, trash, and domestic animals. Ecological opportunity in the forms of habitat and food heterogeneity are thought to be important mechanisms in maintaining individual specialization. Identifying which contexts, traits, and mechanisms determine the success or failure of individuals within an urban wildlife population could potentially provide predictions about which populations may succeed in human-dominated landscapes and which may experience local extinction. We used both scat and stable isotope analysis of whiskers to investigate the degree to which coyotes (Canis latrans) utilized anthropogenic subsidies and exhibited individual diet specialization across the urban-rural gradient in southern California. Land use surrounding scat and isotope sample locations was also evaluated to determine the effect of land cover on diet. Human food constituted a significant portion of urban coyote diet (22% of scats, 38% of diet estimated by stable isotope analysis). Domestic cats (Felis catus) and ornamental fruit and seeds were also important items in urban coyote diets. Consumption of anthropogenic items decreased with decreasing urbanization. In suburban areas, seasonality influenced the frequency of occurrence of anthropogenic subsidies with increased consumption in the dry season. The amount of altered open space (areas such as golf courses, cemeteries, and landscaped parks) nearby had a negative effect on the consumption of anthropogenic items in both urban and suburban areas. Contrary to our hypothesis, urban coyotes displayed reduced between-individual variation compared to suburban and rural coyotes. It is possible that the core urban areas of cities are so densely developed and subsidized that wildlife inhabiting these areas actually have reduced ecological opportunity. Suburban animals had the broadest isotopic niches and maintained similar individual specialization to rural coyotes. Wildlife in suburban areas still have access to relatively undisturbed natural areas while being able to take advantage of anthropogenic subsidies in neighboring residential areas. Therefore, areas with intermediate urban development may be associated with increased ecological opportunity and specialization.",PONE-D-19-21059 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0228881 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used sudden CO(2)-outgassing and associated shifts in DIC-δ (13)C brought by waterfalls as an excellent natural experimental set-up to quantify impacts of changes in algal isotopic baselines on ecological inferences from IFIs. METHODS: Carbon (δ (13)C) and nitrogen (δ (15)N) stable isotopic ratios of invertebrate communities sharing similar structure were measured at above- and below-waterfall sampling sites from five rivers and streams in Southern Quebec (Canada). For each sampled invertebrate community, the six Laymans IFIs were then calculated in the δ -space (δ (13)C vs. δ (15)N). RESULTS: As expected, isotopic functional richness indices, measuring the overall extent of community trophic space, were strongly sensitive to changes in isotopic baselines unlike other IFIs. Indeed, other IFIs were calculated based on the distribution of species within δ-space and were not strongly impacted by changes in the vertical or horizontal distribution of specimens in the δ-space. Our results highlighted that IFIs exhibited different sensitivities to changes in isotopic baselines, leading to potential misinterpretations of IFIs in river studies where isotopic baselines generally show high temporal and spatial variabilities. The identification of isotopic baselines and their associated variability, and the use of independent trophic tracers to identify the actual energy pathways through food webs must be a prerequisite to IFIs-based studies to strengthen the reliability of ecological inferences of food web structural properties.",9999 [pii] and 10.7717/peerj.9999 [doi],Aquatic food webs and Stable isotopes and Trophic structure and Waterfalls,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the archaeological evidence points to a largely pastoral lifestyle, knowledge regarding the general composition of human diets and their variation across landscapes and during the different phases of the Bronze Age is still restricted. Human and animal skeletal remains from the burial mounds that dominate the archaeological landscape and their stable isotope compositions are major sources of dietary information. Here, we present stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data of bone collagen of 105 human and 50 animal individuals from the 5th millennium BC to the Sarmatian period, with a strong focus on the Bronze Age and its cultural units including Maykop, Yamnaya, Novotitorovskaya, North Caucasian, Catacomb, post-Catacomb and late Bronze Age groups. The samples comprise all inhumations with sufficient bone preservation from five burial mound sites and a flat grave cemetery as well as subsamples from three further sites. They represent the Caucasus Mountains in the south, the piedmont zone and Kuban steppe with humid steppe and forest vegetation to its north, and more arid regions in the Caspian steppe. The stable isotope compositions of the bone collagen of humans and animals varied across the study area and reflect regional diversity in environmental conditions and diets. The data agree with meat, milk, and/or dairy products from domesticated herbivores, especially from sheep and goats having contributed substantially to human diets, as it is common for a largely pastoral economy. This observation is also in correspondence with the faunal remains observed in the graves and offerings of animals in the mound shells. In addition, foodstuffs with elevated carbon and nitrogen isotope values, such as meat of unweaned animals, fish, or plants, also contributed to human diets, especially among communities living in the more arid landscapes. The regional distinction of the animal and human data with few outliers points to mobility radii that were largely concentrated within the environmental zones in which the respective sites are located. In general, dietary variation among the cultural entities as well as regarding age, sex and archaeologically indicated social status is only weakly reflected. There is, however, some indication for a dietary shift during the Early Bronze Age Maykop period.",PONE-D-20-09975 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0239861 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although much is known of their feeding preferences from field studies, conclusions, especially in relation to differing habits in wet and dry seasons, are often contradictory. Here, two remote approaches, stable carbon isotope analysis and remote sensing, were combined to investigate dietary changes in relation to tree and grass abundances to better understand elephant dietary choice in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. A composited pair of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper satellite images characterising flushed and senescent vegetation states, typical of wet and dry seasons respectively, were used to generate land-cover maps focusing on the forest to grassland gradient. Stable carbon isotope analysis of elephant faecal samples identified the proportion of C(3) (typically browse)/C(4) (typically grass) in elephant diets in the 1-2 days prior to faecal deposition. The proportion of surrounding C(4) land-cover was extracted using concentric buffers centred on faecal sample locations, and related to the faecal %C(4) content. Results indicate that elephants consume C(4) vegetation in proportion to its availability in the surrounding area during the dry season, but during the rainy season there was less of a relationship between C(4) intake and availability, as elephants targeted grasses in these periods. This study illustrates the utility of coupling isotope and cost-free remote sensing data to conduct complementary landscape analysis at highly-detailed, biologically meaningful resolutions, offering an improved ability to monitor animal behavioural patterns at broad geographical scales. This is increasingly important due to potential impacts of climate change and woody encroachment on broad-scale landscape habitat composition, allowing the tracking of shifts in species utilisation of these changing landscapes in a way impractical using field based methods alone.",8622 [pii] and 10.7717/peerj.8622 [doi],Behavioural ecology and Diet and Elephant and Isotope and Kruger National Park and Landsat and Remote sensing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ust'-Polui is an Iron Age site located on the Lower Ob River, a major northern fishery characterized by extreme seasonal shifts in fish presence. During a 6-month period stretching over the coldest months of the year, fish are nearly entirely absent in the Lower Ob River. Despite this, the stable isotope compositions of the dog's bone and dentine collagen and hair and nail keratin all indicate a monotonous diet focusing on local fish. This pattern indicates the dog was provisioned year-round with fish. This was likely accomplished by mass harvesting of fish using nets or traps. Such fish were then processed and frozen for consumption during the non-fishing season. These findings suggest that people in the Ust'-Polui region also relied to some extent on fish throughout the year.

   (rainfall and temperature), in 29 streams across South Africa. Community
   structure was shaped by both land use and climatic factors. The
   taxonomic diversity of invertebrates was best explained by an
   independent negative effect of urbanization, while abundance declined in
   summer. However, we could not use our variables to predict fish
   diversity (suggesting that other factors may be more important). Both
   trophic functional diversity (quantifed usingisotopic richness) and food
   chain length declined with increasing temperature. Functional redundancy
   (quantifed usingisotopic uniqueness) in the invertebrate community was
   high in wet areas, and a synergistic interaction with urbanization
   caused the lowest values in dry urban regions. There was an additive
   effect of agriculture and rainfall on abundance-weighted vertebrate
   functional diversity (quantified usingisotopic dispersion), with the
   former causing a decline in dispersion, with this partially compensated
   for by high rainfall. In most cases, we found that a single dominant

   describe Antarctic benthic food webs and the diet of species occurring
   in shallow waters (Tethys Bay, Ross Sea) before and after seasonal
   sea-ice break-up. We hypothesized that the increased availability of
   primary producers (sympagic algae) following sea-ice break-up affects
   the diet of species and thus food web architecture. Basal resources had
   distinct isotopic signatures that did not change after sea-ice break-up,
   enabling a robust description of consumer diets based on Bayesian mixing
   models. Sympagic algae had the highest delta C-13 (similar to-14 parts
   per thousand) and red macroalgae the lowest (similar to-37 parts per
   thousand). Consumer isotopic niches and signatures changed after sea-ice
   break-up, reflecting the values of sympagic algae. Differences in food
   web topology were also observed. The number of taxa and the number of
   links per taxon were higher before the thaw than after it. After sea-ice
   break-up, sympagic inputs allowed consumers to specialize on abundant
   resources at lower trophic levels. Foraging optimization by consumers
   led to a simpler food web, with lower potential competition and shorter
   food chains. However, basal resources and Antarctic species such as the
   bivalve Adamussium colbecki and the sea-urchin Sterechinus neumayeri
   were central and highly connected both before and after the seaice
   break-up, thus playing key roles in interconnecting species and
   compartments in the web. Any disturbance affecting these species is
   expected to have cascading effects on the entire food web. The seasonal
   break-up of sea ice in Antarctica ensures the availability of resources
   that are limiting for coastal communities for the rest of the year.

   such as Western Europe because of the relatively ubiquitous use of
   agrochemicals and the lack of unaffected areas. To study a wide gradient
   of agrochemical stress, we conducted a study in Central Romania, where
   traditional agriculture, which is assumed to use less agrochemicals,
   exists adjacent to intensive agriculture. We investigated potential
   effects of land use related stressors including pesticides on
   aquatic-terrestrial predator-prey relationships using stable isotope
   analysis. Therefore, we sampled spiders, as well as their aquatic and
   terrestrial prey along streams with a pesticide pollution gradient and
   determined spider and prey stable carbon and nitrogen signals. Results
   Aquatic prey contributed 40.8-55.4\% to the diet of the orb web weaving
   spider Tetragnatha sp. and 34.0-53.0\% to the diet of the ground-hunting
   Pardosa sp. The biomass of potential aquatic prey increased along a
   gradient of increasing riparian habitat conditions and water quality and
   decreasing agriculture (e.g. arable land) in the catchment. The
   proportion of aquatic prey in the orb web weavers diet responded
   positively to the biomass of potential aquatic prey and negatively to
   this gradient. Increasing potential prey biomass resulted in an
   increasing proportion of aquatic prey for the orb web weaver. The
   proportion of aquatic prey in the ground hunters diet increased with
   in-stream pesticide toxicity and along a gradient of increasing
   pastoralism in the catchment as well as increasing riparian habitat and
   water quality. Conclusion The diet of two riparian predators responded
   to complex gradients of catchment land use, stream and riparian habitat
   quality as well as to in-stream pesticide toxicity. The responses to the
   different environmental variables can be attributed to direct (e.g.
   change in spider community) and indirect (e.g. changes in aquatic prey

   elevated nutrient concentrations causing widespread eutrophication. An
   integrated palaeoecology, and palaeo-and-modern food web approach,

   regulated wetland (i.e. Kings Billabong). The lack of preserved sediment
   suggests the wetland was naturally intermittent before 1890. After this
   time, when used as a water retention basin, the wetland experienced net
   sediment accumulation. Subfossil cladocerans, and delta C-13 of Daphnia,

   coyotes (<i>Canis latrans</i>) in southern California",PLOS ONE,"Urban environments are unique because fragments of natural or
   semi-natural habitat are embedded within a potentially permeable matrix
   of human-dominated areas, creating increased landscape and, potentially,
   habitat heterogeneity. In addition, urban areas can provide diet
   subsidies for wildlife species in the form of fruiting ornamental
   plants, trash, and domestic animals. Ecological opportunity in the forms
   of habitat and food heterogeneity are thought to be important mechanisms
   in maintaining individual specialization. Identifying which contexts,
   traits, and mechanisms determine the success or failure of individuals
   within an urban wildlife population could potentially provide
   predictions about which populations may succeed in human-dominated
   landscapes and which may experience local extinction. We used both scat
   and stable isotope analysis of whiskers to investigate the degree to
   which coyotes (Canis latrans) utilized anthropogenic subsidies and
   exhibited individual diet specialization across the urban-rural gradient
   in southern California. Land use surrounding scat and isotope sample
   locations was also evaluated to determine the effect of land cover on
   diet. Human food constituted a significant portion of urban coyote diet
   (22\% of scats, 38\% of diet estimated by stable isotope analysis).
   Domestic cats (Felis catus) and ornamental fruit and seeds were also
   important items in urban coyote diets. Consumption of anthropogenic
   items decreased with decreasing urbanization. In suburban areas,
   seasonality influenced the frequency of occurrence of anthropogenic
   subsidies with increased consumption in the dry season. The amount of
   altered open space (areas such as golf courses, cemeteries, and
   landscaped parks) nearby had a negative effect on the consumption of
   anthropogenic items in both urban and suburban areas. Contrary to our
   hypothesis, urban coyotes displayed reduced between-individual variation
   compared to suburban and rural coyotes. It is possible that the core
   urban areas of cities are so densely developed and subsidized that
   wildlife inhabiting these areas actually have reduced ecological
   opportunity. Suburban animals had the broadest isotopic niches and
   maintained similar individual specialization to rural coyotes. Wildlife
   in suburban areas still have access to relatively undisturbed natural

   patterns were not consistent for all localities and different types of
   artificial structures, which reinforces the importance of considering
   local scales for conservation and management purposes. Finally, delta

   change from C-4 based diet to C-3/C-4 mixed diet occurred during the
   Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770-221 BC) on the Central Plains of China.
   However, the role of each C-3 crop (wheat, rice and soybean) in human

   argued that wheat made the biggest contribution to human diet among the
   C-3 crops. To further investigate the dietary role of wheat and
   agricultural economy in the Eastern Zhou on the Central Plains of China,
   combined methods of stable isotope analysis on human bones and starch
   grain analysis on human dental calculus were conducted at Laodaojing

   The mean delta C-13 values (-14.7 +/- 2 parts per thousand, n = 24) and
   mean delta N-15 values (9.1 +/- 0.9 parts per thousand, n = 24) of
   individuals from Laodaojing cemetery suggest that Laodaojing humans had
   a reliance on the mixture of C-3/C-4 foods and a certain proportion of

   Laodaojing were mainly derived from wheat and millets respectively.
   Temporal investigations of stable isotope data and archaeobotanical
   evidences from the late Longshan period to Eastern Zhou Dynasty show the
   importance of wheat increased in agricultural economy slowly since its
   introduction into the Central Plains of China. Until the Eastern Zhou

   ice-benthic habitats. By contrast, a nearly exclusive amount of sea
   ice-derived carbon was maintained in high-Arctic Atlantic walrus (98\%
   in 1996 and 89\% in 2006) despite a similar percentage in sea ice
   reduction. Nitrogen isotope baseline or the trophic position of Atlantic
   walrus did not change over time at either location. These findings

   flora and fauna. Most notably, Europeans brought with them numerous
   non-native species, including the European red fox (Vulpes vulpes),
   European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), and the goat (Capra hircus)
   among many others. The introduction of these species had significant
   consequences on native Australian mammals, causing some small- to

   range in Western Australia before and after European arrival. Fossils
   from south-western Australia and modern specimens were examined via

   the presence of invasive predators on mainland Australia. The quokka
   maintains a browsing diet from the Pleistocene to the present on the
   mainland, but modern island populations eat drier and tougher foods when
   living on islands lacking invasive mammals. There is also an apparent
   shift in the feeding environment of the quokkas on mainland Australia,
   from more open forests/shrublands in the Pleistocene to denser and

   coastline in Patagonia, Argentina, and analyzed differences in

   consumption differed among breeding locations, with lower consumption
   further from the reported location of first Argentinean introduction

   regularly consumed green crabs at most breeding locations, this invasive

   benthic invertebrates were collected in the littoral zone of the Lago de

   were processed in the laboratory, organisms were identified, counted and
   weighed. Gut contents and delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotopes

   Conclusion: Most of the organisms studied were linked to omnivorous
   habits, evidenced in a wide spectrum of food items in their diet. The

   novel resources. Along the western slope of the Andes, the modification
   of natural landscapes have resulted in significant declines in native
   prey, the introduction of non-native species, and an increase in the
   availability of anthropogenic resources. These factors have likely
   influenced the resources available to Andean condors (Vultur gryphus),
   however, data are lacking as to how condor's diet vary along their large
   latitudinal range. We evaluated differences in Andean condor diet along
   a similar to 2500 km latitudinal gradient in Chile from the heavily
   modified Central zone (32-34 degrees S) to the more pristine Austral
   zone (44-56 degrees S). We assessed diet composition through the
   identification of prey remains in condor pellets, and carbon and
   nitrogen isotope analysis of condor feathers and their primary prey
   identified from pellet analysis. Our results identified medium- and
   large-bodied domesticated mammals (ungulates) and introduced exotic
   species (lagomorphs) as common prey across the study area. Condors from
   the Central zone had the largest isotopic niche width, probably related
   to consumption of anthropogenic resources with distinctly high carbon
   isotope values indicative of C-4-based foods likely acquired from
   landfills or corn-fed livestock. Isotopic niches for condors from the
   Southern and Austral zones almost completely overlapped. Andean condor
   diet is strongly influenced by local conditions determining differential
   access to prey sources. The high dependence of Andean condors on
   livestock across a large geographical area, and landfills in more
   (sub)urban areas, may help stabilize their populations via anthropogenic
   resources subsidies. Long-term dependence on such resources, however,
   may have health costs including contaminant exposure and greater
   mortality risk. These data will help identify potential threats related
   to resource availability and use, and better inform management and

   geographic and climatic changes, which affected the megafaunal
   occupation, adaptation and succession. Six Proboscidean taxa have been
   found from various localities throughout Java extending back to the
   Early to Late Pleistocene. The six taxa are: Stegoloxodon indonesicus,
   Sinomastodon bumiajuensis, pygmy Stegodon sp., Stegodon trigonocephalus,
   Elephas hysudrindicus and Elephas maximus, in which respective taxa are
   included in successive faunal stages. The aim of this research was to
   reconstruct the succession of Proboscidea in Java and the adaptation of
   each taxon to environmental changes by incorporating stable isotope
   analysis with the fossil faunal record, geology and stratigraphy. We
   conducted stable carbon (delta C-13) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotope
   analysis of the carbonate phase in the tooth enamel of six proboscidean
   taxa from numerous localities and ages. Our results suggest that for the
   earliest terrestrial fauna from Java, represented by Stegoloxodon
   indonesicus, the feeding ecology was restricted to a closed canopy
   rainforest during the earliest Pleistocene, while towards the late Early
   Pleistocene, the successive taxon, Sinomastodon bumiajuensis, was
   adapted to different or increasingly drier grassy habitats. C-4
   expansion on the island took place since the later part of the Early
   Pleistocene (before 1.5 Ma) and continued until the Middle Pleistocene,
   as suggested by the carbon and oxygen isotope composition of assemblages
   of proboscidean taxa from Sangiran, Kedung Brubus, Trinil, and western

   Proboscidea in the Ngandong Fauna suggests that fragmented dense

Shuran Cindy Wang and Xueqin Liu and Yong Liu and Hongzhu Wang,2020,Benthic-pelagic coupling in lake energetic food webs,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,"Understanding how energy and matter flow among habitats is a central
   issue in ecology. In lake ecosystems, benthic-pelagic coupling (B-P
   coupling) was mainly studied based on the diets of top consumers at a
   population level or through food chains. However, how B-P coupling
   operates at the ecosystem level is largely unknown.
   In the present study, we revealed B-P coupling within an energetic food
   web framework, combining stable isotope analyses and mass balanced
   model. We constructed the energetic food webs of two large shallow lakes
   of different trophic status based on field survey data. We also defined
   benthic and pelagic components based on the proportion of consumer
   energy uptake from phytoplankton (benthic: < 50\%; pelagic: > 50\%;
   benthivore: < 20\%; planktivore: > 80\%; coupler: 20-80\%) and
   quantified the energy flux through B-P coupling in the two lake food
   webs.
   The total consumption was estimated to be 699 t/km(2)/y in Lake Erhai
   (mesoeutrophic lake) and 2094 t/km(2)/y in Lake Dianchi (hypereutrophic
   lake), and the B-P coupling energy was 405 t/km(2)/y and 213 t/km(2)/y,
   re-spectively. In these lakes, B-P coupling occurred on multiple trophic
   levels; lower trophic level consumers contributed the largest proportion
   (90\% and 98\%), while top consumers were of limited importance; most
   coupling links were weak, and energy exchange was highly asymmetric with
   the total amount of energy exported from benthic part to pelagic part
   being over 4 folds of the counter flux.
   The quantity and pattern of B-P coupling vary between the mesoeutrophic
   and hypereutrophic lakes. In terms of energy flux per unit area, the
   total system throughput in the mesoeutrophic lake (Lake Erhai) was 3.73
   times of that in the hypereutrophic lake (Lake Dianchi), while the
   proportion of coupling energy was much lower in the former (19\%) than
   the latter (31\%). A greater energy flux through pelagic-to-benthic
   pathways was found in the hypereutrophic lake, and most of the coupling
   energy was contributed by consumers at higher trophic levels. Besides,
   the coupling strength was stronger in the hypereutrophic than the
   mesoeutrophic lake.
   We showed for the first time how B-P coupling operates in lake energetic
   food webs. Our results provided new insights into understanding the
   energy flux through B-P coupling of lake ecosystems, and how such

   Resources Supporting Tropical River Fish Assemblages in Chiapas, Mexico",TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY,"Environmental changes caused by hydrological shifts between wet and dry
   seasons in the tropics drive variation in resource availability and
   feeding interactions for riverine fish assemblages, but studies of
   trophic structure typically take place over short time scales that do
   not adequately capture this variation. In this study, we used analysis
   of stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) to assess seasonal
   changes in the diversity and relative importance of production sources
   supporting fish assemblages in La Venta River, the largest tributary of
   Netzahualcoyotl Reservoir on the Grijalva River in Chiapas, Mexico.
   Based on established river ecosystem theories, we expected the relative
   importance of carbon sources supporting fishes to shift seasonally, with
   greater use of instream resources during low-water periods and an
   increasing contribution from terrestrial sources during high-water
   periods. Abundant, low-trophic-level food resources (i.e., plants and
   invertebrates) were expected to support most fish species in the wet
   season, whereas piscivory was predicted to increase as habitat volume
   declined and fish density increased in the dry season. Somewhat
   surprisingly, we found that terrestrial energy sources were assimilated
   more during low-water conditions at some sites, and ranges of delta C-13
   were higher in the dry season. Terrestrial carbon supporting fish
   production in low-water periods likely came from riparian plant detritus
   that remained in the river after flows receded and/or leaf litter that
   accumulated in the dry season. Ranges of delta N-15 were similar across
   seasons, with no apparent increase in piscivory during the dry season.
   Higher trophic redundancy was observed in the wet season, likely due to
   fish taking advantage of the same readily available food items (e.g.,
   pulses of arthropod prey) during high flows. Documenting seasonal use of

   from understanding how environmental variability interacts with

   sampling the first primary feather of 99 Cory's shearwaters (Calonectris

   provide robust evidence on the individual changes of isotopic ratios of
   carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) over 17 years. We reported
   a slight longitudinal decline of delta C-13 values throughout 2001-2017,
   even after being adjusted for the marine Suess effect (linked to the
   increasing CO2 emissions). Although CC is often considered to be
   overexploited by industrial fisheries, we could not detect a decline in
   Cory's shearwater trophic level indicating a change in the trophic web
   structuring, as revealed by delta(15) N. We found negative correlations
   of delta C-13 and delta N-15 with the CC upwelling intensity, indicating
   annual variability in baseline isotopic levels propagates through the
   food chain and it integrates in predators' tissues. Low individual
   repeatabilities among years at population level indicates low long-term
   specialization, suggesting long-lived individuals foraging on highly
   productive areas can adjust their foraging strategies and diet according
   to environmental variability. However, individual-level repeatabilities
   in isotopic values showed a range of individual specialization within
   the population, indicating most individuals are generalist and a few of

   detect any temporal trend in the trophic level of the Cory's shearwater
   population, suggesting a stability in the structure of the pelagic food
   web of the CC over the last two decades despite the fishing pressure.

   small changes in the trophic ecology of a population. Finally, the

   data from more than 1,050 fossil teeth that record the dietary patterns
   of nine herbivore families in the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene
   (3.6 to 1.05 Ma) from the Shungura Formation, a hominin-bearing site in

   observed prior to 2.9 Ma followed by a decrease in the proportion of
   mixed feeders and an increase in grazers between 2.7 and 1.9 Ma, and a

   one of the greatest periods of social, political, and economic upheaval
   in Europe, and has left its mark on the historical consciousness of
   people in this part of the world. Nevertheless, there remains
   considerable debate as to the degree to which the diets and economic
   status of different sections of society were impacted by this
   transition, with these so-called `Dark Ages' often being uniformly
   considered as static and impoverished, particularly for populations
   along the Mediterranean rim. Such questions are especially important in
   central Italy, with its position at the former core of the Roman Empire
   leaving it most vulnerable to the major social and political shifts of
   the first millennium AD. However, direct insights into the diets of
   individuals in this region, across this key period, have been scarce,
   particularly in diachronic perspective. Here, we apply stable carbon

   measurements of both tooth enamel bioapatite and bone collagen suggest

   interpret this as a shift from an agricultural focus on wheat following
   the Roman agrarian tradition towards the inclusion of millet as a
   reliable fallback food. We argue that this was part of a growing local
   and regional resilience amongst communities in the Medieval period, with

Here we conducted a large-scale field experiment to characterize differences in food web composition and stable isotopes (δ¹³C, δ¹⁵N, δ³⁴S) for salmon rearing on a large floodplain and adjacent river in the Central Valley, California, USA. The study covered variable hydrologic conditions including flooding (1999, 2017), average (2016), and drought (2012-2015). In addition, we determined incorporation rates and tissue fractionation between prey and muscle from fish held in enclosed locations (experimental fields, cages) at weekly intervals. Finally, we measured δ³⁴S in otoliths to test if these archival biominerals could be used to reconstruct floodplain use. Floodplain-reared salmon had a different diet composition and lower δ13C and δ³⁴S (δ¹³C = -33.02±2.66‰, δ³⁴S = -3.47±2.28‰; mean±1SD) compared to fish in the adjacent river (δ¹³C = -28.37±1.84‰, δ³⁴S = +2.23±2.25‰). These isotopic differences between habitats persisted across years of extreme droughts and floods. Despite the different diet composition, δ¹⁵N values from prey items on the floodplain (δ¹⁵N = 7.19±1.22‰) and river (δ¹⁵N = 7.25±1.46‰) were similar, suggesting similar trophic levels. The food web differences in δ13C and δ³⁴S between habitats were also reflected in salmon muscle tissue, reaching equilibrium between 24-30 days (2014, δ¹³C = -30.74±0.73‰, δ³⁴S = -4.6±0.68‰; 2016, δ¹³C = -34.74 ±0.49‰, δ³⁴S = -5.18±0.46‰). δ³⁴S measured in sequential growth bands in otoliths recorded a weekly time-series of shifting diet inputs, with the outermost layers recording time spent on the floodplain (δ³⁴S = -5.60±0.16‰) and river (δ³⁴S = 3.73±0.98‰). Our results suggest that δ¹³C and δ³⁴S can be used to differentiate floodplain and river rearing habitats used by native fishes, such as Chinook Salmon, across different hydrologic conditions and tissues.

Fishes and basal sources showed a broad range of δ15N (fishes: 6.49-14.94‰; sources: 2.58-6.79‰) and δ13C values (fishes: -23.86 to -13.71‰; sources: -24.32 to -13.53‰), while shrimps and crabs exhibited similar nitrogen and carbon ratios.

Adults with chicks are thought to gradually switch feeding sites from freshwater wetlands to coastal mudflats as the chicks' osmoregulatory system develops. We investigated age-dependent shifts in the diet of Black-faced Spoonbill chicks at four breeding colonies with varying freshwater habitat availability by examining stable isotopes (δ13C, δ15N) between the tip (grown at the age of 10 days) and middle (grown at the age of 22 days) portions of their primary feathers. The δ13C value of the middle portions was significantly higher than that of the tips, which suggested that the ratio of marine resources increased with the growth and development of chicks. A Bayesian isotope mixing model revealed that the diet proportion of marine prey in the early-chick rearing season was slightly higher than in the late-chick rearing season at three colonies in inshore areas, although this proportion was approximately 60% even in the early chick-rearing period. In contrast, isotopic values and reconstructed diet composition suggested that chicks in an offshore colony with limited freshwater wetlands relied more heavily on freshwater diets for both chick-rearing periods (>80%). Our results suggest that the shifts in feeding sites seen in previous studies might be related to the age-dependent dietary shift of chicks, highlighting the importance of freshwater wetlands for spoonbills on offshore islands without an inflow of freshwater in nearby intertidal mudflats. These findings emphasize the importance of freshwater prey and wetlands even for the endangered marine-breeding spoonbills, even though the negative impact of salt stress remains inconclusive.",PONE-D-20-35243 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0253469 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Carbon stable isotope was not correlated to fish length, but positive significant correlation between δ15N values and fish length was found for the non-native piranha. Also, immature and adult S. marginatus showed low isotopic niche overlap. The correlation between fish length and δ15N, and the low trophic overlap between immature and adult, indicate that the non-native S. marginatus had ontogenetic shifts in food preference, which may be viewed as an additional mechanism underlying its successful establishment in the upper Paraná River.

Collembola are among the most abundant arthropods inhabiting the belowground system sensitively responding to changes in vegetation and soil conditions. However, most studies on the response of Collembola to land-use change were conducted in temperate ecosystems and focused on shifts in community composition or morphological traits, while parameters more closely linked to ecosystem functioning, such as trophic niches, received little attention. Here, we used stable isotope analysis ((13)C and (15)N) to investigate changes in the trophic structure and use of food resources by Collembola in Jambi province (Sumatra, Indonesia), a region that experienced strong deforestation in the last decades. Isotopic values of Collembola from 32 sites representing four land-use systems were analyzed (rainforest, rubber agroforest, rubber (Hevea brasiliansis) and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) monoculture plantations). Across Collembola species Δ(13)C values were highest in rainforest suggesting more pronounced processing of litter resources by microorganisms and consumption of these microorganisms by Collembola in this system. Lower Δ(13)C values, but high Δ(13)C variation in Collembola in oil palm plantations indicated that Collembola shifted towards herbivory and used more variable resources in this system. Small range in Δ(15)N values in Collembola species in monoculture plantations in comparison to rainforest indicated that conversion of rainforest into plantations is associated with simplification in the trophic structure of Collembola communities. This was further confirmed by generally lower isotopic niche differentiation among species in plantations. Across the studied ecosystems, atmobiotic species (Symphypleona and Paronellidae) occupied the lowest, whereas euedaphic Collembola species occupied the highest trophic position, resembling patterns in temperate forests. Some species of Paronellidae in rainforest and jungle rubber had Δ(15)N values below those of leaf litter suggesting algivory (Salina sp.1, Callyntrura sp.1 and Lepidonella sp.1), while a dominant species, Pseudosinella sp.1, had the highest Δ(15)N values in most of the land-use systems suggesting that this species at least in part lives as predator or scavenger.

This may alter tree allometry, as light regime, water, and nutrient availability can change at the forest edge. Increased root growth may optimize resource uptake and/or enhance tree anchorage to withstand the altered wind regime. However, little is known about the patterns of the root-shoot allometric responses to strip cuttings. In three alpine stands differing in climate, site productivity, and stand characteristics, we selected 71 Norway spruce trees and took increment cores from stems, root collars, and main roots. This enabled us to study changes in the long-term root-stem allometry for 46 years and short-term allometric responses to intervention. The effects of cutting were compared between edge trees and trees from the stand interior in 10 years before and after the intervention. The long-term allocation to roots increased with stem diameter, with the strongest effects on the regularly managed stand with the tallest and largest trees. These results support the allometric biomass partitioning theory, which postulates resource allocation patterns between different plant organs to depend on plant size. Strip cutting on north-facing slopes boosted edge-tree growth in all plant compartments and enhanced allocation to roots. This change in allometry started 2 years after cutting but disappeared 7-8 years later. In the post-cutting period, the highest root-shoot increase was observed in the small trees independent of the site. This indicates the change in growing conditions to have the strongest effects in formerly suppressed trees. Thus, the effect of such acclimation on the wind firmness of subdominant spruce trees is a question with high importance for optimizing cutting layouts in lowering post-cutting vulnerability to disturbance. The results from this case study contribute to a better understanding of the structural acclimation of spruce trees from high-elevation forests to new forest edges.

In this study, we compare progesterone, cortisol and carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes in female bearded and ringed seals during 1953-1968 (pre-1968, a period prior to sea ice decline) to 1998-2014 (post-1998, a period during sea ice decline). When comparing these periods, bearded seals had statistically higher cortisol concentrations post-1998, and for both species δ(13)C was more negative post-1998, while progesterone and δ(15)N did not change. There was a positive relationship between progesterone and cortisol Z-scores for both species, except for ringed seals post-1998. There was a negative relationship between cortisol Z-scores and δ(13)C for bearded seals evident in post-1998 indicating that higher cortisol Z-scores are associated with more negative δ(13)C in bearded seals in recent years. This negative relationship between cortisol and δ(13)C in bearded seals suggests a shift to higher prey diversity, possibly due to changes in sea ice in the Pacific Arctic evident post 1998. Progesterone Z-scores corresponded to expected differences among non-pregnant, unimplanted, implanted and post-partum individuals. Using these data, pregnancy history was determined for reproductive years for each individual female sampled, which could allow for yearly pregnancy rates to be calculated given a large enough representative sample of the population.

   the biomass and diversity of the invertebrates exchanged between
   freshwater streams and terrestrial grasslands in a natural warming
   experiment in Iceland. We sampled invertebrates emerging from the
   streams, those landing on the water surface, ground-dwelling
   invertebrates falling into the streams, and those drifting through the
   streams. Emerging invertebrate biomass or diversity did not change with
   increasing temperature, suggesting no effect of warming on aquatic
   subsidies to the terrestrial environment over the 1-month duration of
   the study. The biomass and diversity of aerial invertebrates of
   terrestrial origin landing on the streams increased with temperature,
   underpinned by increasing abundance and species richness, indicating
   that the greater productivity of the warmer streams may attract more
   foraging insects. The biomass of ground-dwelling invertebrates falling
   into the streams also increased with temperature, underpinned by
   increasing body mass and species evenness, suggesting that soil warming
   leads to terrestrial communities dominated by larger, more mobile
   organisms, and thus more in-fall to the streams. The biomass and
   diversity of terrestrial invertebrates in the drift decreased with
   temperature, however, underpinned by decreasing abundance and species
   richness, reflecting upstream consumption due to the higher energetic
   demands of aquatic consumers in warmer environments. These results
   highlight the potential for asynchronous responses to warming for
   reciprocal subsidies between aquatic and terrestrial environments and

   Valley in southeastern California has transformed from desert scrub into
   agricultural land, while breeding Horned Larks have persisted in the
   area. We compared the isotopic composition of nitrogen (delta N-15),
   carbon (delta C-13), and hydrogen (delta H-2) from feathers of lark
   specimens from two time periods in the Imperial Valley: a historical
   series collected between 1916 and 1923 and more recent vouchers

   C-13 values from plants and soil samples in contemporary agricultural
   land and adjacent desert scrub to estimate isotopic baseline changes
   associated with agricultural intensification. Contemporary larks had
   lower delta N-15 and delta C-13 ratios compared to historical larks,
   while plant and soil delta N-15 ratios were higher at agricultural sites

   temporal change in isotope values that cannot be explained by shifting

   thousand(2); delta N-15 and delta C-13) was lower among contemporary
   larks. Thus, contemporary larks in the Imperial Valley may capitalize on
   seeds and phytophagous insects that are abundant among crops, possibly
   representing an opportunistic change in diet over time in response to
   agriculture. Finally, delta H-2 values did not differ between historical
   and contemporary larks, but contemporary larks had delta H-2 values that

   riparian forest conversion. Here, we used community structure,
   functional diversity, and stable isotope analyses to assess the impacts
   of riparian deforestation on macroinvertebrate communities of streams in
   southern Mexico. Monthly sampling during the dry season was conducted in
   streams with riparian forest (forest streams), and in streams with
   pasture dominating the riparian vegetation (pasture streams). Samples
   were collected for water quality (physical-chemical variables, nutrient
   concentrations, and total suspended solids), organic matter (leaf litter
   abundance and algal biomass), and macroinvertebrate abundance and
   diversity. Higher temperature, conductivity, suspended solids, and
   chlorophyll a were detected in pasture streams, while nitrate
   concentrations and leaf litter biomass were greater in forest streams.
   Maaoinvertebrate density was higher in pasture sites, while no
   differences in taxonomic diversity and richness were found between land
   uses. Functional evenness was greater in forest streams, while richness
   and divergence were similar between land uses, despite differences in
   taxonomic composition. Environmental variables were associated with taxa
   distribution but not with functional traits, suggesting current
   conditions still promote redundancy in ecological function. Isotopic
   analyses indicated consumers in pasture streams were enriched in C-13
   and N-15 relative to forest streams, potentially reflecting the higher
   algal biomass documented in pasture systems. Isotopic niches were
   broader and more overlapped in pasture streams, indicating more
   generalist feeding habits. No significant losses of taxonomic or
   functional diversity were detected in pasture streams. However, changes
   in trophic ecology suggest landscape-level processes are altering

   gate-controlled rivers in northern Taihu Lake were analyzed using
   statistical analysis and stable isotope analysis in R (SIAR). The
   results show that the concentrations of various nitrogen forms showed
   obvious spatial-temporal distribution characteristics by multiple
   sources. Specifically, the nitrogen concentration was lower during the
   wet season than the dry season (T = 6.02, p < 0.01). Gate construction
   had a dual effect on the water environment, because it changed both the
   nitrogen transport processes and the nitrogen enrichment risk between
   the river side and lake side. The 818O-NO3- and 815N-NO3- values were
   sensitive to anthropogenic activity intensity and urbanization process,

   Marenzelleria arctia in the zoobenthos of the Neva Estuary after its

   due to significant negative relationships between the biomass of

   substantially to the diet. Tissue type was more important in explaining
   variation in dietary contributions than individual variation for
   semi-adult FPM. The strong reliance on terrestrial resources sheds new
   light on the functional role of unionid mussels and the connection of
   streams to their riparian area. The dependence of FPM on terrestrial

   significant concern over the last few decades. This study assessed the
   distribution of synthetic organic compounds (SOCs) in the food web of
   Lake Mead, Nevada/Arizona, USA and how this distribution was influenced
   by the introduction of invasive quagga mussels. A clear spatial gradient
   of SOC concentrations in water was observed between lake basins
   downstream of populated areas andmore rural areas. Within the foodweb,
   trophic magnification factors (TMF) indicated statistically significant
   biomagnification for nine, and biodilution for two, of 22 SOCs examined.
   The highest value recorded was for PCB 118 (TMF, 5.14), and
   biomagnification of methyl triclosan (TMF, 3.85) was also apparent.
   Biodilution was observed for Tonalide (R) (0.06) and Galaxolide (R)
   (0.38). Total SOC concentration in quagga mussels was higher than in
   three pelagic fishes. Also, 19 of 20 SOC examined in Largemouth Bass
   (Micropterus salmoides) had substantially lower concentrations in 2013,
   when quagga mussels had become well established, than in 2007/08, soon
   after quagga mussels were introduced. Estimates of SOC concentrations in
   the water column and quagga mussels suggest that a considerable portion
   (similar to 10.5\%) of the SOC mass in the lake has shifted from the
   pelagic to the benthic environments due to quagga mussel growth. These
   observations suggest that benthic species, such as the endangered
   Razorback Sucker, may be experiencing increased risk of SOC exposure. In
   addition, stable isotope analysis (carbon and nitrogen) indicated a
   decrease in the nutritional value of zooplankton to consumers (e.g.,
   Razorback Sucker larvae) since quagga mussels became established. These
   changes could affect Razorback Sucker larval survival and recruitment.

   production inferred from sea-ice presence and colony migratory status.
   Colonies with higher sea-ice cover during the pre-incubation period had
   higher median colony THg, delta N-15, and delta C-13. Individuals at
   migratory colonies had relatively higher THg and delta N-15, and lower
   delta C-13, suggesting a higher trophic position and a greater reliance

   Stable isotope values differed between species but did not vary between
   years or seasons, and only for some species with fish size. Stable
   isotope values were not different between immigrating (spring) and
   emigrating (autumn) fish, suggesting a similar trophic niche of the
   various fish species in the coastal zone and inside the Wadden Sea. For
   the majority of species, average delta C-13 values were within the range
   of -12 to -20.5 parts per thousand, showing that both (marine) pelagic
   and benthic primary producers were at the base of the food web. Average
   delta N-15 values varied among species from 13-18 parts per thousand,
   resulting in estimated trophic positions (TPs) of 2.1-5.5 with the
   majority between 2.2 and 3.5. Thick-lipped grey mullet Chelon labrosus,

   For all species, estimated TPs based on isotope values were lower than

   explained by species-specific differences in trophic fractionation or by
   underestimation of the contribution of smaller prey species in the
   stomach content analysis. The trophic niche space of benthopelagic
   species was the smallest and overlapped with that of the pelagic and
   benthic species. In terms of area use, trophic niche space was smaller

   settling organic matter and provide an energy link to higher trophic
   levels. These benthic communities are highly dependent on the food
   sources provided through sinking organic material, with pelagic-benthic
   coupling particularly strong on Arctic shelf systems. Arctic shelves,
   however, are experiencing shifts in the timing of sea ice breakup that
   can have severe implications on the amount and composition of organic
   matter from different primary production sources supplied to the
   benthos. The role of benthic invertebrates in processing organic matter
   is typically classified by feeding types. The goal of this study was to
   evaluate if benthic invertebrate feeding types are a useful concept for
   understanding how organic matter from various biosynthetic sources is
   used by benthic invertebrates across the Arctic Chukchi Sea. We employed
   essential amino acid (EAA) specific stable isotope fingerprinting to
   identify proportional contributions of three EAA sources (from
   bacterial, phytoplankton, and terrestrial production) as a proxy of
   carbon sources to the diets of benthic consumers. When grouped by
   feeding types, the proportional contributions of the three EAA sources
   were similar among suspension, deposit feeders and predators/scavengers.
   Different genera within the same feeding type, however, showed
   significant differences among the EAA sources, indicating that EAA use
   is genus-specific rather than feeding type-specific. We discuss
   characteristics other than feeding mode among genera that could account
   for different EAA use, including mobility, selectivity of available EAA
   in sediments, and other trophic aspects such as assimilation efficiency.
   These characteristics provide useful additional considerations when
   grouping organisms by feeding types. High proportions of terrestrial EAA
   were found in the majority of benthic genera across all feeding types
   and characteristics in this study, reflecting the high proportions of
   this organic matter source in sediments and confirming that this source
   is being used by benthic consumers in the Arctic. EAA contributions to
   various benthic genera across the Chukchi Sea shelf had only weak
   correlations with environmental variables. While the distinctly
   different uses of different EAA sources by benthic-feeding genera but
   not by feeding types may represent high trophic plasticity in Arctic
   benthic invertebrates, expected climate change-driven shifts in the

   to facilitate coexistence through local niche partitioning. A general
   paradigm for coexistence of carp(NT) and carp(T) in this study was that
   carp(NT) increased the use of low-quality food resources (such as
   submerged plants) to mitigate the competition for limited resources
   (i.e., zoobenthos) resulting from niche partitioning. This change
   resulted in an enlarged niche width of carp(NT) and increased the niche
   overlap with its sympatric competitor, that is, carp(T), which led to an
   increase in the individual specialization within the population to
   enhance resource use efficiency. This study represents the first
   controlled empirical test of the trophic interactions between

   Isotopic niche metrics indicate a low trophic diversity for pelagic

   The distribution of invasive wild pigs (Sus scrofa) has been sharply
   expanding throughout all regions of Brazil in the last few years. Here
   we demonstrate that large monocultural plantations provide the primary
   resource subsidies to invasive wild pigs in Brazil. We analyzed 106
   stomach contents and carbon stable isotopes (delta C-13) of 50 hair
   samples of wild pigs from a population inunersed in a landscape
   dominated by sugar cane agriculture. Stomach contents were dominated by
   corn (41\%), sugarcane (28.5\%), vegetal matter (all other vegetation
   besides crops, 27\%), and animal matter (vertebrates and invertebrates,
   4\%). Bayesian mixing model analysis of delta C-13 showed that food
   sources from C-4 photosynthetic pathway (represented by corn and
   sugarcane) accounted for 94\% of the long-term diet, while C-3 food
   sources for only 6.2\%. Our results indicate that corn and sugar cane
   are subsidizing the diet of wild pigs and can facilitate the population
   growth of this invasive species. Given that Brazil is a major
   agricultural producer and a hotspot of biodiversity, it is extremely
   concerning that extensive agriculture may accelerate the expansion of
   this invasive species, resulting in economic losses and cascading

   cover on the trophic ecology of a highly threatened fish",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,"Understanding risks to aquatic systems posed by changing drought regimes
   is particularly important for the conservation of already threatened
   taxa. However, little is known about how local environmental conditions,
   especially those in heavily human-influenced situations, interact with
   regional shifts such as droughts to alter realised impacts on aquatic
   communities, including threatened top predators. Here, we investigated
   the combined effects of stream drying intensity and riparian canopy
   cover on the trophic interactions of critically endangered kowaro, or
   Canterbury mudfish (Neochanna burrowsius) in an agricultural area of New
   Zealand. Fish populations and their potential prey, both terrestrial and
   aquatic, as well as environmental variables, including riparian canopy
   cover and drying measured with stage loggers, were sampled over eight
   visits to 24 sites spanning orthogonal drying and canopy gradients.
   Stable isotope ratios,C-13/C-12 and(15)N/N-14, were used to investigate
   trophic links between mudfish and their terrestrial and aquatic prey
   across these gradients. When non-native willows (predominantlySalix
   fragilis) dominated the riparian canopy, increased tree cover led to
   elevated drying intensity, probably driven by their relatively high
   water demands compared to other trees. However, in the absence of
   willows, canopy cover had no effect on drying intensity. Although this
   was the only direct link between these two environmental factors, they
   had opposing effects on kowaro populations, which will be important for
   management under drought. Increased drying intensity contributed to
   elevated abundance of microcrustacea and aquatic Diptera larvae, and an
   increase in the relative abundance of kowaro juveniles. However,
   drying-affected kowaro populations also had fewer large reproductive
   adults and elevated delta N-15 values, probably driven by physiological
   limitations and an increase in kowaro cannibalism, respectively. By
   comparison, increased canopy cover enhanced input of terrestrial
   invertebrates, a food resource for larger kowaro, leading to elevated
   kowaro delta C-13 values, no effects on delta N-15 values, and higher
   relative abundance of large kowaro in shaded streams compared to
   unshaded streams. Thus, the riparian canopy cover was able to offset
   some of the effects of drying. Overall, we found no interactions between
   drying intensity and canopy cover affecting kowaro. However, their
   opposing effect highlights the important role local conditions such as
   riparian canopies play on aquatic communities and their potential role

   ecological parameters in Southern Ocean ecosystems. Of critical concern
   are the consequences of these changes on the range of species that show
   fidelity to migratory destinations, as philopatry is hypothesized to
   help or hinder adaptation to climate change depending on the
   circumstances. Many baleen whales show philopatry to feeding grounds and
   are also capital breeders that meet migratory and reproductive costs
   through seasonal energy intake. Southern right whales (Eubalaena
   australis, SRWs) are capital breeders that have a strong relationship
   between reproductive output and foraging success. The population
   dynamics of South Africa's population of SRWs are characterized by two
   distinct periods: the 1990s, a period of high calving rates; and the
   late 2010s, a period associated with lowered calving rates. Here we use

   foraged on prey isotopically consistent with the waters of the

   prey, for example, the decrease in abundance and southward range
   contraction of Antarctic krill. By linking reproductive decline to

   a survey of lowland streams in Hong Kong during 2018-19 to document the

   environmental context influences the response of stream and riparian
   ecosystems to a small, recolonizing population of anadromous Pacific

   bird assemblages, across 500-m-long sections in each study reach,
   spanning a total of 18 km of river habitat that varied in both adult
   salmon inputs and channel gradient. The BA and reach-scale analyses both
   indicated that salmon biomass inputs were associated with increases in
   aquatic macroinvertebrate taxa richness and the densities of 2 primary
   consumers (Glossosoma spp. and Chironomidae larvae). Stable isotope
   analysis indicated that adult salmon subsidies were also associated with
   dietary changes in pelagic-foraging predators (the non-anadromous
   resident Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum, 1792) and
   benthic-foraging sculpin (Cottus spp.). The reach-scale analysis also

   overlap of these two dominant omnivores. Seasonal changes in resource
   availability strongly influenced the consumption and assimilation of
   resources by the two fish species. Both species exhibited high levels of
   omnivory, characterized by high diversity of allochthonous resources in
   the wet season. Terrestrial invertebrates were the main component of
   diet during this season. However, in the dry season, both species
   reduced their isotopic niches, indicating diet specialization. High diet
   overlap was observed in both seasons, but the isotopic niche overlap was
   smaller in the dry season. Substantial reduction in the isotopic niche
   of P. bifascistus and a shift toward aquatic invertebrates can
   facilitate coexistence during this season of resource shortage. Feeding
   plasticity allows omnivorous fish to adjust their trophic niches

   resources during periods of greater resource diversity. This seasonal
   variation could be an important mechanism that contributes to the

   inter-specific competition is important in freshwater ecosystems for
   understanding the ecological changes that can result from activities
   such as fish stocking events (using alien and/or native fish species),
   as well as from natural processes that elevate population abundances
   (e.g. increased annual recruitment success). While increased
   inter-specific competition can result in slower growth rates and/or
   reduced population density in the weaker or less abundant competitor, it
   is important that this is assessed in relation to the impacts of
   increased intra-specific competition.
   We tested how the strength of inter-specific competition from a
   co-existing species varies with abundance, and how this compares with
   increased intra-specific competition. Fish were the model taxa, as their
   growth rates strongly correlate with competitive success. Replicated
   pond mesocosms (150 days) used chub Squalius cephalus in an allopatric

   sympatric treatments (n = 5) with European barbel Barbus barbus (n = 5

   fish-specific growth rates (SGRs), and the size and position of the
   trophic and isotopic niche (stomach contents and stable isotope {[}SI]
   analyses respectively).
   Chub SGRs were significantly higher in C5 versus all other treatments,
   but did not differ among the other allopatric and sympatric treatments.
   Chub trophic niche sizes in T1 to T3 were significantly smaller than C5,
   indicating more specialised diets in the presence of barbel. Chub
   trophic niche size in C10 was, however, larger than C5 and T1,
   indicating a shift to a more generalised diet as intra-specific
   competition increased.
   As SGRs reduced in treatments, so did the predicted extent of fish SI
   turnover, with SI data in T1 to T3 not at isotopic equilibrium with
   their diet in the mesocosms at the experiment's end. Following
   conversion of fish SI data to represent values at 95\% isotopic
   turnover, chub isotopic niches also revealed shifts to a more general
   diet as intra-specific competition increased, but to more specialised
   diets as inter-specific competition increased.
   Increased intra- and inter-specific competition impacts on the trophic
   and isotopic niches were contrasting; both metrics indicated niche

   planktivorous cyprinid species collected from the meso-eutrophic Rimov
   Reservoir, Czechia, over its entire four-decade history (1979-2016). The
   delta C-13 of the fish scales varied greatly throughout the reservoir
   history. The lowest delta C-13 values were observed immediately after
   the reservoir was filled in 1979, indicating that fish production at
   that time was likely partially supported by C-13-depleted CO2 released
   from the inundated soil. During the 1980s, due to the high levels of
   phytoplankton production stimulated by high phosphorus inputs from the
   catchment, the delta C-13 values substantially increased. However, since
   1990, the delta C-13 values have generally decreased, reflecting a
   gradual reduction in reservoir primary production caused by the
   decreasing input of phosphorus and increasing input of dissolved organic
   carbon from the catchment. The delta C-13 of fish scales was also used
   to reconstruct the CO2 concentration of the surface water. The
   reconstructed CO2 varied significantly during the four-decade history,
   but it was always below the air-equilibrium concentration, suggesting
   that the surface water of the reservoir has consistently absorbed
   atmospheric carbon. The fish-scale delta N-15 values remained relatively
   stable, while slightly increasing within three years after impoundment,
   likely because the nitrogen supply was high throughout the studied
   period. Our study contributes to the growing body of literature

   surveys along with fish diet and stable isotope analyses revealed that
   the eelgrass trophic network included two main top predatory fish

   mesograzers (crustaceans or gastropods). Mesograzer abundance in the
   study area was high, and capable of mitigating the effects of increased
   algal biomass that resulted from experimental nutrient enrichment in the
   field. When crustacean mesograzers were experimentally excluded,
   gastropod mesograzers were able to compensate and limit the effects of
   nutrient enrichment on eelgrass biomass and growth. Our results suggest
   that top-down processes (i.e., suppression of algae by different
   mesograzer groups) may ensure eelgrass resilience to nutrient enrichment

   in the Phanerozoic marine carbon cycling, the mid-Ludfordian positive
   delta C-13(carb) excursion (MLCIEcarb), which occurred in the aftermath
   of the Lau/Kozlowskii Bioevent (LKB). There are still controversies
   regarding origin of the MLCIE and its possible causal link (s) with
   respect to the preceding LKB. Surprisingly, the isotope fractionation of
   carbon between inorganic and organic carbon pools during the MLCIE was
   not investigated in detail. To constrain better this parameter of marine
   C cycle, its linkage to the LKB, and local sulfur cycle, we analysed
   high-resolution delta C-13(carb), delta C-13(org), and delta S-34(py)
   records in the Prague Basin (peri-Gondwana) representing one of the most
   complete records of the MLCIEcarb in the world. Evaluation of these
   high-resolution delta C-13(org) and delta C-13(carb) records reveals
   their tight coupling, which in turn indicates the photosynthetic origin
   of the MLCIEorg via links to primary production and changing rates of
   organic carbon burial. On the other hand, our data also reveal a
   short-term decoupling of the delta C-13(org) and delta C-13(carb)
   records preceding the MLCIE which may have been related to a purported
   increase in atmospheric pCO(2) levels or anoxic event. The peak of the
   Delta C-13 anomaly exactly coincides with the LKB and, therefore, for
   the first time suggests a tight link between the change in marine carbon
   cycling and the bioevent. Subsequent rapid drop of the Delta C-13 values
   (and by inference also atmospheric pCO(2)) fits well with a rapid
   cooling and globally documented regression reported for this time
   interval. Finally, the documented strong coupling of delta C-13(carb)
   and delta S-34(py) records during the MLCIE points to an intensive
   microbial sulfate reduction which should increase carbonate alkalinity

   biographies of megalithic graves has long obscured a significant amount
   of synchronic and diachronic information. The Rioja Alavesa region of
   north-central Iberia holds a number of megalithic graves with large
   skeletal assemblages that can generally be ordered by internal
   stratigraphy and/or relatively fine-grained radiocarbon chronologies,
   providing a rare opportunity to assess the potential of such
   information. Here, we undertake stable carbon and nitrogen isotope
   analyses of 125 human and seven animal bone collagen samples from six
   late prehistoric megalithic graves (La Cascaja, El Sotillo, San Martin,

   contrast, an apparent continuity in subsistence is seen, at least
   isotopically, from the Middle Chalcolithic to the Bronze Age, despite

   reported to affect the diet of fish (e.g., change in prey composition
   and availability), eventually resulting in alterations in their nursery
   function. Most studies in Europe are based on fish gut content analysis,
   which only reflect a small proportion of pressures to salt marshes, and
   do not necessarily reflect long-term disturbances. In this study, we
   investigated the impact of salt-marsh vegetation type on trophic network
   structures (i.e., fish diet and trophic position). Primary producers
   (particulate organic matter, microphytobenthos, and dominant terrestrial
   plants), potential aquatic and terrestrial prey, and fish of two
   dominant species (sea bass and thinlip mullet) were sampled during the

   (diet and trophic position) suggested a dominant site effect and a
   weaker effect of surrounding vegetation type. Site effect was attributed
   to differences in anthropogenic nitrogen inputs (with a steep increase
   in the Mont-Saint Michel Bay) and tidal regime between the two bays,
   with more marine signatures associated with a higher frequency and
   duration of tidal flooding events in the Seine Estuary. A second
   hypothesis is that invasive Elytrigia acuta, which has recently replaced
   typical salt-marsh vegetation in Mont-Saint-Michel Bay, negatively
   impacted the native salt-marshes nursery function by modifying the
   access to terrestrial prey on this site. The trophic position of the sea
   bass and the thinlip mullet was unchanged by local salt marsh
   vegetation, and considered consistent with their diet. This study

Recent studies on the effect of drought on soil microarthropods focused on measures of abundance and diversity. We here additionally investigated shifts in trophic niches of Collembola and Oribatida as indicated by stable isotope analysis ((13)C and (15)N). We simulated short-term summer drought by excluding 65% of the ambient precipitation in conventionally and organically managed winter wheat fields on the DOK trial in Switzerland. Stable isotope values suggest that plant litter and root exudates were the most important resources for Collembola (Isotoma caerulea, Isotomurus maculatus and Orchesella villosa) and older plant material and microorganisms for Oribatida (Scheloribates laevigatus and Tectocepheus sarekensis). Drought treatment and farming systems did not affect abundances of the studied species. However, isotope values of some species increased in organically managed fields indicating a higher proportion of microorganisms in their diet. Trophic niche size, a measure of both isotope values combined, decreased with drought and under organic farming in some species presumably due to favored use of plants as basal resource instead of algae and microorganisms. Overall, our results suggest that the flexible usage of resources may buffer effects of drought and management practices on the abundance of microarthropods in agricultural systems.",12777 [pii] and 10.7717/peerj.12777 [doi],Collembola and DOK trial and Drought and Organic farming and Oribatida and Soil microarthropods and Stable isotopes and Trophic niche,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the fate of discards in marine environments. Discarding may provide food for various marine consumers, potentially affecting food web structure and stability. Yet, quantifying reliance upon discards is difficult because identity and frequency of discards may change according to multiple factors, and most previously used diet assessment techniques do not allow to assume consistency of feeding strategies over time. One currently untested hypothesis is that significant contribution of discards over time should reflect in increased trophic level (TL) of marine fauna, particularly in low TL consumers. Here, we explored this hypothesis by modeling the TL and assimilated diet of consumers living in fishing grounds subject to important discarding activity using stable isotope analysis. We found indications that benthic invertebrates and Chondrichthyes may depict a higher than expected TL, while other fish tend to depict similar to lower TL compared to global averages from the literature. Based on prior knowledge of discard consumption in the same area, stable isotope mixing models congruently revealed that discards may represent substantial portions of the assimilated diet of most benthic invertebrate macrofauna, cephalopods and Chondrichthyes. We highlight limitations and challenges of currently used diet assessment techniques to study discard consumption and stress that understanding their reintegration in marine food webs is crucial in the context of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management and to better understand the functioning of marine ecosystems subject to fishing.",PONE-D-21-34501 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0268758 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A number of anthropogenic pressures are impacting species diversity in inland waters and, amongst them, the spread of invasive alien species is considered one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss and homogenisation in freshwater habitats.Crayfish species are widely distributed freshwater invaders and, while alien species introductions occur mostly accidentally, alien crayfish are often released deliberately into new areas for commercial purposes. After their initial introduction, crayfish species can rapidly establish and reach high-density populations as a result of their adaptive functional traits, such as their generalist diet.The Louisiana crayfish Procambarusclarkii (Girard, 1852) is globally considered one of the worst invaders and its impact on recipient freshwater communities can vary from predation and competition with native species, to modification of food webs and habitat structure and introduction of pathogens. Native to the south United States and north Mexico, P.clarkii has been introduced in Europe, Asia and Africa, determining negative ecological and economic impacts in the majority of invaded habitats where it became dominant within the receiving benthic food webs. Due to its flexible feeding strategy, P.clarkii exerts adverse effects at different trophic levels, ultimately affecting the structure and dynamics of invaded food webs. It is, therefore, paramount to evaluate the ecological consequences of P.clarkii invasion and to quantify its impact in a spatially explicit context. NEW INFORMATION: In the past decades, the analysis of stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and other elements has become a popular methodology in food web ecology. Notably, stable isotope analysis has emerged as a primary tool for addressing applied issues in biodiversity conservation and management, such as the assessment of the trophic ecology of non-indigenous species in invaded habitats. Here, we built two geo-referenced datasets, resolved respectively at the population and individual scale, by collating information on δ(13)C and δ(15)N values of P.clarkii within invaded inland waters. The population-scale dataset consists of 160 carbon and nitrogen isotopic values of the Louisiana crayfish and its potential prey, including living and non-living primary producers and benthic invertebrates. The dataset resolved at individual scale consists of 1,168 isotopic records of P.clarkii. The isotopic values included within the two datasets were gathered from 10 countries located in Europe, Asia, Africa and North America, for a total of 41 studies published between 2005 and 2021. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this effort represents the first attempt to collate in standardised datasets the sparse isotopic information of P.clarkii available in literature. The datasets lend themselves to being used for providing a spatially explicit resolution of the trophic ecology of P.clarkii and to address a variety of ecological questions concerning its ecological impact on recipient aquatic food webs.",94411 [pii] and 10.3897/BDJ.10.e94411 [doi],Louisiana crayfish and ecological impact and invasive species and red swamp crayfish and stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similarly, there are no studies addressing how forestry related disturbances to the structure of headwater food webs manifest (accumulate/dissipate) downstream and/or whether forest management alters natural longitudinal trends predicted by the RCC. Using stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen, we investigated how: 1) autochthony in macroinvertebrates and fish change from small streams to larger downstream sites within a basin with minimal forest management (New Brunswick, Canada); 2) longitudinal trends in autochthony and food web length compare among three basins with different forest management intensity [intensive (harvest and replanting), extensive (harvest only), minimal] to detect potential cumulative/dissipative effects; and 3) forest management intensity and other catchment variables are influencing food web dynamics. We showed that, as predicted, the reliance of some macroinvertebrate taxa (especially collector feeders) on algae increased from small streams to downstream waters in the minimally managed basin, but that autochthony in the smallest shaded stream was higher than expected based on the RCC (as high as 90% for some taxa). However, this longitudinal increase in autochthony was not observed within the extensively managed basin and was weaker within the intensively managed one, suggesting that forest management can alter food web dynamics along the river continuum. The dampening of downstream autochthony indicates that the increased allochthony observed in small streams in response to forest harvesting cumulates downstream through the river continuum.

Given their opportunistic, omnivorous nature the consumptive and competitive impacts of house mice on islands have the potential to vary over time in concert with resource availability and mouse population dynamics. METHODS: We examined the ecological niche of invasive house mice on Southeast Farallon Island, California, USA using a combination of mouse trapping, food resource surveys, and stable isotope analysis to better understand their trophic interactions with native flora and fauna. Specifically, we coupled the analysis of seasonal variation in resource availability over a 17-year period (2001-2017), carbon (δ (13)C) and nitrogen (δ (15)N) stable isotope values of mouse tissue and prey resources in a single year (2013), and isotopic niche and mixing models to quantify seasonal variation in mouse diets and the potential for resource overlap with native species. RESULTS: We found that plants were the most important resource for house mice during the spring months when vegetation is abundant and mouse populations are low following heavy precipitation and declines in mouse abundance during the winter. While still consumed, plants declined in dietary importance throughout the summer and fall as mouse populations increased, and seabird and arthropod resources became relatively more available and consumed by house mice. Mouse abundance peaks and other resource availability are low on the island in the fall months when the isotopic niches of house mice and salamanders overlap significantly indicating the potential for competition, most likely for arthropod prey. DISCUSSION: Our results indicate how seasonal shifts in both mouse abundance and resource availability are key factors that mediate the consumptive and competitive impacts of introduced house mice on this island ecosystem. As mice consume and/or compete with a wide range of native taxa, eradication has the potential to provide wide-reaching restoration benefits on Southeast Farallon Island. Post-eradication monitoring focused on plant, terrestrial invertebrate, salamander, and seabird populations will be crucial to confirm these predictions.",13904 [pii] and 10.7717/peerj.13904 [doi],Diet and Invasive species and Island ecology and Rodents and Seabirds and Seasonality and Stable isotope analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To characterize and manage the associated risks, considerable numbers of organisms are sampled regularly for monitoring purposes. However, ethical and financial issues call for an alternative, more generic and more robust approach for assessing the internal exposure of fish that circumvents large variability in biota sampling due to interindividual differences. Passive sampling devices (PSDs) offer a fugacity-based approach for pollutant enrichment from different abiotic environmental compartments with a subsequent estimation of bioaccumulation in fish which we explored and compared to HOC concentrations in fish as determined using traditional approaches. RESULTS: In this study, concentrations in silicone-based PSDs applied to the water phase and suspended particulate matter (SPM) of a river polluted with HOCs were used to estimate the concentration in model lipids at thermodynamic equilibrium with either environmental compartment. For comparison, muscle tissue of seven fish species (trophic level 1.8 to 2.8) was extracted using traditional exhaustive solvent extraction, and the lipid-normalized concentrations of HOCs were determined. The PSD-based data from SPM proved to be a more conservative estimator for HOCs accumulated in fish than those from water. Body length of the fish was found to be more suitable to describe increasing accumulation of HOCs than their trophic level as derived from stable isotope analysis and might offer a suitable alternative for future studies. CONCLUSIONS: By combining fugacity-based sampling in the abiotic environment, translation into corresponding concentrations in model lipids and body length as an indicator for increasing bioaccumulation in fish, we present a suggestion for a robust approach that may be a meaningful addition to conventional monitoring methods. This approach potentially increases the efficiency of existing monitoring programs without the need to regularly sacrifice vertebrate species.

   stream ecosystem function. Study sites were located in the Midwestern US
   and divided into three land use groups (forested, buffered,
   agricultural) based on the amount of riparian forest and row crop
   agriculture in the watershed. Stable isotope analysis (delta C-13 and
   delta(15) N) was performed on basal energy sources and consumers (6
   invertebrate groups and 7 fish species) with isotopic metrics used to
   assess variation in food web structure related to land use, instream
   environmental parameters, and food resources. Land use differences were
   associated with community-wide isotopic shifts with all trophic
   diversity metrics greater in forested compared to agricultural streams,
   whereas buffered streams were generally intermediate. Agricultural
   streams had compressed food webs with high trophic redundancy indicative
   of a shared resource pool for all consumers. In contrast, forested and
   buffered stream food webs showed larger trophic niche area due to
   greater utilization of detrital energy and higher variability in trophic
   position among invertebrates and fish. Circular statistics revealed fish
   communities shifted to lower trophic positions and increased dependence
   on periphyton production in agricultural streams. The presence of
   riparian forests was associated with a broader range of resources used
   by consumers, expanded trophic diversity, and elevated fish trophic

   what drives them remains poorly understood. It has been hypothesized
   that high primary production drives lower trophic levels and shorter
   food chain length in coastal regions. Here, we evaluate this hypothesis
   on the British Columbia (BC) coast as this coastal marine ecosystem is
   comprised of regions with contrasting levels of primary production. We
   measured nitrogen stable isotopes from zooplankton, micronekton, and
   nekton collected from four of the main water bodies of southern BC
   during a survey completed in August of 2019. We used Sentinel-3
   satellite data to determine overall production in each region across a
   5-year climatology and during the 2019 season. Results showed that
   primary production varied significantly between the four regions and
   that increases in phytoplankton biomass were driven by increases in
   microphytoplankton. Nitrogen isotope data demonstrated a significant
   inverse relationship between a region's primary production and both
   total food chain length and trophic level in species sampled in multiple
   regions, but no change in the trophic structure of the zooplankton
   community across regions. Changes in species' trophic levels were
   therefore driven by shifts in the level of zooplanktivory. These results
   support a model of bottom-up omnivory driving coastal food web
   structure, where levels of primary production, specifically biomass of
   microphytoplankton, determine food chain length and the distribution of
   trophic levels. High microphytoplankton biomass supports a large biomass
   of large grazing zooplankton, which drive increases in omnivorous
   feeding behaviour among the micronekton and nekton.",10.1093/icesjms/fsac171,food webs; marine; pelagic; stable isotopes; trophic level,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

   Argentina)",FOOD WEBS,"Undaria pinnatifida is one of the most successful marine invasive
   species worldwide. Since its first detection in Nuevo Gulf (Argentina),
   changes in the species richness and diversity of native algae and
   macrofauna have been reported. Knowledge of the invasive alga-native
   grazer interaction is key to better understand ecosystem dynamics and
   the potential effects of Undaria on local food webs. The aim of this
   study was to compare the diet of the sea urchin Arbacia dufresnii, among
   different scenarios of invasion of Undaria in two northern Patagonian
   gulfs. To this end, we determined the relative contribution of kelp to
   the diet of the sea urchin by comparing the gut content and stable
   isotopes in different tissues of A. dufresnii from sites where the
   invasion of Undaria was advanced, relatively recent, or not recorded.
   Because A. dufresnii has a plastic feeding habit and Undaria represents
   a high input of algal biomass, our hypothesis was that A. dufresnii
   feeds on Undaria and that the contribution of the invasive kelp to the
   diet of the sea urchin will be greater according to the time elapsed
   since invasion. Our results confirmed that A. dufresnii fed on Undaria
   and assimilated in gonads and muscle. The contribution of Undaria to the
   sea urchin diet was related to the stage of invasion. In the site with
   an advanced stage of invasion, A. dufresnii consumed the kelp both in
   spring and summer, when sporophytes were mature and senescent,
   respectively. However, in the recently invaded site, A. dufresnii
   consumed Undaria only in summer, when the kelp was senescent. Arbacia
   dufresnii is an omnivore species with the plasticity to adapt its diet
   to a variety of resources depending on the availability in the
   environment, prioritizing faunal items. This work reinforces the
   importance of complementing gut analysis with stable isotope analysis to
   determine the contribution of items in the diet. Although the impacts of
   an invasive alga on food webs and ecosystem structure are difficult to
   evaluate, performing these analyses in different scenarios may allow
   better understanding the local food web structure and assessing the

   role in the stability of communities. In river systems, fragmentation of
   natural habitats and environmental changes alters the energy basis and
   community composition, consequently leading to variations in the
   community's trophic structure and niche space. However, our
   understanding of how the trophic structure responds to environmental
   changes is still very limited. Here, based on stable isotope data, we
   explored and compared trophic positions (TPs), community-wide trophic
   metrics, and isotope niche space of fish communities in three reaches
   with different hydrogeomorphic conditions along a highly regulated
   subtropical river over three seasons. The community trophic structure
   and niche space showed notable spatiotemporal variations. Overall, the
   downstream reach had lower TPs, trophic diversity but higher trophic
   redundancy. The middle reach occupied a wider isotope niche space than
   other reaches, with the largest niche size during autumn. Furthermore,
   the niche overlap was relatively high in winter between reaches and in
   the downstream between seasons. The results implied a homogenization of
   feeding functional groups and energy flow pathways of species in the
   downstream community associated with the change of energy source and
   stability of hydrological conditions. The relationship between trophic
   structure and environmental factors suggested that the dam-induced

   Hemimysis anomala (the bloody red shrimp), a mysid native to the
   Ponto-Caspian region that is now established throughout the Laurentian
   Great Lakes region (North America) and Europe, is characterized by high
   densities and a trophic ecology that may be consequential to mercury
   fluxes and bioaccumulation. We combined methylmercury (MeHg) and stable
   isotope (delta N-15 and delta C-13) analyses of invertebrates from
   Seneca Lake (NY, USA) to test the hypotheses that mercury concentrations
   differ among (1) H. anomala and native or naturalized analogs due to
   food-web position and (2) stages of H. anomala due to ontogenetic diet
   shifts. The MeHg concentration and delta N-15 of H. anomala exceeded
   other littoral invertebrates (such as amphipods, dreissenid mussels, and
   zooplankton >153 mu m) and were as high as the pelagic, native Mysis
   diluviana. These taxa-specific patterns indicate intensified
   biomagnification of MeHg is possible in near-shore and reef-spawning
   fish following the establishment of H. anomala, an energy-dense prey

   anomala had higher MeHg concentrations and more enriched delta N-15 than

   than a canal site. These intraspecies contrasts are consistent with the
   shift toward zooplanktivory in adult H. anomala. As both putative prey

   glacial melt and river discharge due to climate change. One way to
   understand ecosystem responses to these stressors is assessing trophic
   relationships. The goal of this study was to better understand how
   hydrography influences trophic structure in high-latitude rocky
   intertidal systems. Our working hypothesis was that food web structure
   differs based on hydrographic conditions. We compared the trophic
   structure of key taxa in two rocky intertidal assemblages in the
   northwestern Gulf of Alaska with a similar regional species pool, but
   differing hydrological inputs: one glacially influenced and one
   primarily marine influenced. Common macroalgal and invertebrate taxa, as
   well as particulate organic matter (POM) were sampled at three rocky
   intertidal sites in each region in 2017 and 2018. Food web structure was
   compared using trophic metrics based on the distribution of shared taxa
   in isotopically-derived (813C and 815N) trophic niche space. The trophic
   niche space of the select taxa in the glacially-influenced rocky
   intertidal system was larger, driven by larger ranges in both carbon and
   nitrogen stable isotope values. Lower 813C and 815N values in POM in
   this system suggest that diverse glacially-influenced allochthonous
   organic material was incorporated into the food web. Macroalgae were a
   more important food source than POM in both regions, and even more so in
   the glacially-influenced region, where macroalgae may be an
   energetically preferable food source compared to silt-laden glacial
   inputs. This study suggests that common intertidal taxa have high
   trophic flexibility enabling them to respond to variable food sources
   under differing environmental conditions, especially by broadening
   resource use in more stressful (glacial) conditions. This supported
   another of our hypotheses, i.e. that taxa in food webs occupying a
   larger trophic niche space engaged in more heterogeneous trophic
   pathways and used more diverse resources, which tends to make such
   systems more stable to perturbations that could affect a single
   resource. The common taxa of high-latitude rocky intertidal systems
   studied here seem to be able to respond to the current stress levels of
   glacial input by using more diverse resources. However, it remains to be
   seen how well these systems are suited to maintain trophic stability

   individuals adopt specialized foraging behaviors not attributable to
   age, sex, or social dominance. While IS increases with the diversity of

   impact of human food subsidies on ecological opportunity is unknown. We
   quantified the isotopic niche width of Steller's Jays (Cyanocitta
   stelleri), a synanthropic predator and dietary generalist, across a
   gradient of human land-use categories ranging from subsidized (park
   campgrounds) to unsubsidized (forest interior) habitats in a protected

   predicted by individual foraging behavior than sex, social dominance, or
   habitat category (indicating IS) and (2) if degree of IS exhibited by
   jays increased with the availability of human food subsidies. We
   characterized the isotopic niche space occupied by individual jays
   relative to the population using carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta
   N-15) isotope values. Using linear models, we found that jay diet
   variation was best explained by individual behavior and habitat use
   rather than by sex or social dominance. While the degree of IS increased
   with the availability of human foods, individual jays exhibited a
   variety of foraging behaviors in all habitats that were segregated by

   the degree of specialization, as jays that specialized on human foods
   had the narrowest niche width regardless of habitat. Management efforts
   targeted at generalist wildlife exhibiting large degrees of IS should
   therefore account for the impact of food subsidies on foraging behavior.
   Approaches that involve aversive conditioning may fail where highly
   specialized individuals are unlikely to encounter treatments; therefore,

   from food constrains growth and reproduction, which subsequently

   understanding of a population's diet for species of conservation
   concern, such as the green turtle (Chelonia mydas). While the diet of
   adult green turtles is generally characterised as primarily herbivorous,
   growing evidence suggests variation in diet between and within
   populations is prevalent. We use complementary stable isotope analysis
   techniques to elucidate diet variation within a C. mydas population
   (ranging from small juveniles to adults) foraging at Ningaloo Reef in
   Western Australia. Analyses of multiple tissues and samples from ten
   individuals recaptured between 4 months and 4.5 years apart revealed
   that adults showed the highest levels of individual specialisation and
   consistency in diet over time. Analysis of red blood cell delta C-13 and

   for all size classes, and sub-adult and adults also ate animals
   (probably jellyfish). Compound-specific stable isotope analysis of amino
   acids indicated the main sources of essential amino acids for Ningaloo
   C. mydas were macroalgae or bacteria. Taken together, these results

   C. mydas diet as predominantly herbivorous, but diet varies with size

   islands: What, where and when to sample",ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"Invasive mammal eradications are widely used for managing island
   ecosystems. However, tracking the outcomes of such large-scale, whole
   ecosystem projects is challenging and costly, and monitoring all
   components of an ecosystem is near impossible. Instead, indicators of
   ecosystem change may provide more practical and integrated measures of
   ecosystem response to eradications. As high-order marine predators,
   seabirds subsidise island eco- systems with nutrients isotopically
   enriched in nitrogen. Invasive mammals have caused a global decline of
   seabirds on islands, reducing this nutrient subsidisation. Following
   eradications, nitrogen stable isotope analysis may provide a useful and
   resource-efficient indicator of ecosystem functional change on
   eradicated islands. However, isotope ratios are affected by a myriad of
   factors, with potential sources of variation being introduced by spatial
   and temporal variation in sampling, and within and between different
   taxa and ecosystem components. To correctly attribute isotopic change to
   post-eradication ecosystem function change, these confounding variables
   need to be understood. To address this need, we analysed stable isotopes

   on the landscape while nitrogen isotope values (delta N-15) may reflect
   precipitation amount. Together, these proxies can provide useful
   information for restoration practitioners seeking to understand how

   and land use. To better calibrate these proxies for use in restoration,
   we compared instrumental records of precipitation and satellite imagery
   of vegetation with isotope values measured in modern bat guano from Mary
   Lawson Cave, a large limestone cavern located in central Missouri. Mary
   Lawson Cave hosts a maternity colony of insectivorous gray bats (Myotis

   the fall of 2018, we collected a 60 cm long guano core that dates to

   very little over this period, the decline in delta C-13 values toward
   the present likely reflects a shift in land management on farms and/or
   increases in invasive C-3 species. Rainfall amounts from nearby Lebanon,
   Missouri, are significantly positively correlated with guano delta N-15
   values, a relationship that is notably opposite that observed previously

   water temperature may have played a key role in the seasonal variation
   of delta C-13. In spring, the high phytoplankton biomass might increase
   the delta C-13 value of small zooplankton in the inner bay. During other
   seasons, the delta C-13 values of zooplankton generally increased from

   discharge. Small zooplankton stable isotope values were significantly
   correlated with that of particulate organic matter (POM). The influence
   of anthropogenic nutrient input on isotopic baseline can be cascaded to
   the zooplankton, and the effect might be weak at higher trophic levels.
   The Bayesian standard ellipse areas of dominant zooplankton groups were

   The aim of this study was two-fold: (1) to identify the proportional
   contributions of organic matter from various primary producers
   (phytoplankton, terrestrial, and bacterial) to depth-stratified
   sediments (0-5 cm) across the Arctic Chukchi Sea shelf using essential
   amino acid (EAA) specific stable carbon isotope biomarkers; and (2) to
   experimentally evaluate sediment bacterial production under different
   temperature scenarios. Proportional contributions of EAA sources to
   surface sediments had little relationship with environmental variables
   across the Chukchi Shelf and only showed noticeably higher terrestrial
   proportions in surface sediments in a high-deposition region in the
   southern study area. Across all sediment depth strata, the majority of
   EAA in sediments (similar to 76\%) originated from terrestrial sources
   and may be indicative of accumulation over time due to slow degradation
   processes of this source within sediments. The different EAA sources
   showed no significant differences in proportional contributions with
   sediment depth except for phytoplankton-derived EAA, which decreased
   with increasing sediment depth. These patterns indicate a well-mixed
   upper sediment horizon, possibly from bioturbation activities by the
   abundant benthos. One EAA source assumed to respond quickly to changing
   environmental conditions are bacteria. To evaluate if and how bacterial
   production would respond to elevated temperatures, sediment bacterial
   production was measured experimentally using phospholipid fatty acid

   While there were no initial differences in the structural components of
   maize residues between varieties, after five months of exposure in the
   field, the lignin content was higher and the organic matter content was
   lower in non-Bt than in Bt maize. Organic matter depletion over time was
   associated with a decrease in primary consumer abundance and an increase
   in their trophic niche width in both Bt and non-Bt maize, but it was
   faster in the former. The abundance of primary consumers and predators
   was higher in non-Bt than in Bt maize, but the distribution of organisms
   across trophic levels differed between varieties, with prey availability
   being lower in non-Bt than in Bt maize. This allowed Bt-associated
   predators to maintain a diet based primarily on the maize food chain
   throughout the experimental period. In contrast, non-Bt-associated
   predators were more dependent on weed-feeding prey by the end of the
   experiment, increasing the coupling between the maize and weed energy

   Less vagile organisms such as Diptera had a specific diet mostly related
   to maize regardless of variety and time, while the diets of more vagile
   organisms like Coleoptera and Opiliones changed the most over time.
   Overall, our results suggest that the attractiveness of non-Bt maize
   residues for invertebrate consumers is higher than the Bt variety,

   Hydropsychidae) in Lake Superior, the Last Stronghold of a Once-Dominant
   Great Lakes Surf Zone Caddisfly",INSECTS,"Simple Summary Prior to the invasion and spread of Dreissena mussels in
   the late 1980s, the nearshore waters of the Laurentian Great Lakes were
   home to diverse assemblages of native aquatic insects, including the
   net-spinning caddisfly Hydropsyche alternans, which occurred in rocky
   surf-exposed habitat throughout the system from Lake Superior downstream
   to Lake Ontario. These surf zone caddisflies are still abundant in the
   largely Dreissena-free waters of Lake Superior where the present study
   was conducted. They have not been reported in the lakes below Lake
   Superior for decades, and are presumed to have been extirpated from
   Dreissena-infested habitats. The ecological profile presented here
   documents the life history of H. alternans in Lake Superior, and reveals
   details of its feeding biology that shed light on the roles that surf
   zone net-spinners play in the native nearshore food webs of the Great
   Lakes. The H. alternans life history in Lake Superior begins in
   mid-summer shortly after oviposition, which features females swimming to
   surf-exposed lake bottom substrates. Larval development takes
   approximately 10 months, but most of it occurs during their first 100
   days. Adult emergence is broadly synchronous, with large numbers present
   from the summer solstice through mid-July. Gut content analyses showed
   that larvae opportunistically feed on algal, animal, and detrital
   material of aquatic and terrestrial origin. delta C-13 and delta N-15
   stable isotope data indicate that they function as omnivores that link
   coastal, nearshore, and pelagic food webs. These energetic links, and
   the very existence of surf zone insect assemblages in the Great Lakes,
   depend on the Dreissena populations in Lake Superior remaining
   relatively small and isolated. We studied the life history, diet, and
   trophic ecology of Hydropsyche alternans in four rocky sites located
   along the south-central coast of Lake Superior. The H. alternans life
   history and broad trophic niche space were similar to those of its
   riverine relatives. Quantitative sampling over the course of one
   ice-free season revealed that most individuals lived univoltine life
   histories that featured early to mid-summer mating, and oviposition and
   rapid growth and development through summer into fall. Most individuals
   overwintered as ultimate or penultimate larval instars. Pupation
   followed ice-out in the spring. Gut content sampling and delta C-13 and
   delta N-15 stable isotope analyses indicated that the typical larval
   diet is a mix of benthic, pelagic, and terrestrial food resources,
   including diatoms, small arthropods, sloughed periphyton, and in one
   site, fugal hyphae apparently of foredune origin. As a
   suspension-feeding omnivore that relies on waves and currents to deliver
   food to its nets, H. alternans larvae form energetic links between
   coastal, nearshore, and offshore food webs. These connections have been
   lost throughout the lower Laurentian Great Lakes as a consequence of the

   of each ecosystem to surface ocean organic matter pools over time and

We used stable isotope analysis to reconstruct the trophic structure of the fish community of Lake Gatun and to compare it to that of a minimally invaded reference lake, Lake Bayano. We found significant differences between the trophic structures of these two Neotropical lakes, notably that Lake Gatun's fish community was characterized by a longer food chain, greater isotopic diversity, a broader range of trophic positions and body sizes, and shifts in the isotopic positions of several native taxa relative to Lake Bayano. The degree of isotopic overlap between native and non-native trophic guilds in Lake Gatun was variable, with herbivores exhibiting the lowest (20%-29%) overlap and carnivores the greatest (81%-100%).

For four seasons, samples of the above-mentioned organisms were collected on five occasions (July and October 2018 and January, April, and July 2019) in Minamata Bay. Isotope analysis showed that Minamata Bay food web structures were almost entirely fueled by microphytobenthos. The THg values of the fish and macrobenthos species were positively correlated with their δ(13)C. This indicates that their diets, which were highly fueled by microphytobenthos, led to high THg bioaccumulation in both macrobenthos and fish. The feeding habits of fishes differ depending on the species, and they prey on organisms of many taxa, including fish (mainly Japanese anchovy), crabs, shrimp, copepods, annelids, and algae. Fish species that preyed on benthic crustaceans had high THg.

"Leighton, Gabriella R M and Froneman, William and Serieys, Laurel E K and Bishop, Jacqueline M",2023,Trophic downgrading of an adaptable carnivore in an urbanising landscape.,Scientific reports,"Urbanisation critically alters wildlife habitat and resource distribution, leading to shifts in trophic dynamics. The loss of apex predators in human-transformed landscapes can result in changes in the ecological roles of the remaining mesocarnivores. Decreased top-down control together with increased bottom-up forcing through greater availability of anthropogenic foods can result in a predation paradox. Understanding these changes is important for conserving ecological function and biodiversity in rapidly urbanising systems. Here, we use stable isotope analysis to provide insight into longer term changes in trophic position, niche width and overlap of an elusive, medium-sized urban adapter, the caracal (Caracal caracal) in and around the city of Cape Town, South Africa. Using fur samples (n = 168) from individuals along a gradient of urbanisation we find that overall caracals have a broad isotopic dietary niche that reflects their large variation in resource use. When accounting for underlying environmental differences, the﻿ intensity of anthropogenic pressure, measured using the Human Footprint Index (HFI), explained variation in both food subsidy use (δ(13)C values) and trophic status (δ(15)N values). The significantly higher δ(13)C values (P < 0.01) and lower δ(15)N values (P < 0.001) of caracals in more urbanised areas suggest that predator subsidy consumption occurs via predictable, anthropogenic resource subsidies to synanthropic prey. These prey species are predominantly primary consumers, resulting in shifts in diet composition towards lower trophic levels. Further, caracals using areas with higher HFI had narrower isotope niches than those in less impacted areas, likely due to their hyperfocus on a few lower trophic level prey species. This pattern of niche contraction in urban areas is retained when accounting for caracal demographics, including sex and age. The removal of apex predators in human-transformed landscapes together with reliable resource availability, including abundant prey, may paradoxically limit the ecological influence of the remaining predators, and bring about a degree of predator trophic downgrading. The dampening of top-down control, and thus ecosystem regulation, likely points to widespread disruption of trophic dynamics in rapidly developing areas globally.",10.1038/s41598-023-48868-x [pii] and 48868 [pii] and 10.1038/s41598-023-48868-x [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Invasive piscivore diet plasticity could complicate suppression success; thus, understanding invasive predator consumption is insightful to meeting conservation targets. Here, we determine if diet plasticity exists in an invasive apex piscivore and whether plasticity could influence native species recovery benchmarks and invasive species suppression goals. We compared diet and stable isotope signatures of invasive lake trout and native Yellowstone cutthroat trout (cutthroat trout) from Yellowstone Lake, Wyoming, U.S.A. as a function of no, low-, moderate-, and high-lake trout density states. Lake trout exhibited plasticity in relation to their density; consumption of cutthroat trout decreased 5-fold (diet proportion from 0.89 to 0.18) from low- to high-density state. During the high-density state, lake trout switched to amphipods, which were also consumed by cutthroat trout, resulting in high diet overlap (Schoener's index value, D = 0.68) between the species. As suppression reduced lake trout densities (moderate-density state), more cutthroat trout were consumed (proportion of cutthroat trout = 0.42), and diet overlap was released between the species (D = 0.30). A shift in lake trout δ13C signatures from the high- to the moderate-density state also corroborated increased consumption of cutthroat trout and lake trout diet plasticity. Observed declines in lake trout are not commensurate with expected cutthroat trout recovery due to lake trout diet plasticity. The abundance of the native species in need of conservation may take longer to recover due to the diet plasticity of the invasive species. The changes observed in diet, diet overlap, and isotopes associated with predator suppression provides more insight into conservation and suppression dynamics than using predator and prey biomass alone. By understanding these dynamics, we can better prepare conservation programs for potential feedbacks caused by invasive species suppression.",PONE-D-22-19581 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0279099 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The food web structure can indicate the response of these ecosystems to ecological threats, such as fish introduction, by analyzing the trophic dynamics. Nonetheless, the food webs of tropical HMLs are less well-studied than temperate HMLs. The present study assessed the food webs of two neighboring (600 m apart) tropical HMLs, El Sol and La Luna, inside the crater of the Nevado de Toluca volcano, Mexico. It used stable isotopes (δ13C and δ15N) and Bayesian mixing models with different trophic discrimination factors and priors to assess the impacts of introduced rainbow trout, persisting only in the larger lake, El Sol. The food web in Lake El Sol was more complex than in Lake La Luna, mainly due to its larger size, extensive vegetated littoral zone, and being fueled by autochthonous primary production. In contrast, the smaller and fishless Lake La Luna has a reduced and bare littoral zone that harbored a simple food web substantially sustained by allochthonous carbon inputs. The persistence of introduced rainbow trout in Lake El Sol but not in Lake La Luna accentuated the differences between the lakes. The models suggested that rainbow trout fed on key consumers of littoral macroinvertebrates (70-80%) and pelagic zooplankton (20-30%), increasing the linkage between sub-networks. In both tropical HMLs, the species richness and herbivorous fraction were elevated compared with temperate HMLs, while the linkage density and omnivorous fraction were lower. Basal nodes dominated these tropical HMLs, and the vegetated littoral zone of Lake El Sol had more intermediate (omnivore) nodes.

Following the arrival of Neolithic groups in the 6th millennium BCE, the Northern Dongola Reach of Upper Nubia witnessed a cultural florescence manifested through elaborate funerary traditions. However, despite the wealth of archaeological data available from funerary contexts, including evidence for domesticated animals and plants as grave goods, the paucity of stratified habitation contexts hinders interpretation of local subsistence trajectories. While it is recognised archaeologically that, against the backdrop of increasing environmental deterioration, the importance of agriculture based on Southwest Asian winter cereals increased throughout the Kerma period (2500-1450 BCE), the contribution of domesticated cereals to earlier Neolithic herding economies remains unclear. This paper presents direct dietary data from a total of 55 Middle Neolithic and Kerma period individuals from Kadruka 21 and Kadruka 1. Microbotanical data obtained from human dental calculus and grave sediments are integrated with human and faunal stable isotopes to explore changes in dietary breadth over time. The combined results demonstrate the consumption of wild plant species, including C4 wetland adapted grasses, by Middle Neolithic individuals at Kadruka 1. Despite existing evidence for domesticated barley in associated graves, the results obtained in this study provide no clear evidence for the routine consumption of domesticated cereals by Middle Neolithic individuals. Rather, direct microparticle evidence for the consumption of Triticeae cereals is only associated with a single Kerma period individual and corresponds with an isotopic shift indicating a greater contribution of C3-derived resources to diet. These results provide evidence for Neolithic dietary flexibility in Upper Nubia through the persistence of foraging activities and support existing evidence linking increased agricultural reliance to the development of the Kerma culture.",PONE-D-22-23418 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0280347 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

   invasive species on food webs, especially when used in tandem with other
   dietary tracers. An invasion by one of the most notorious freshwater
   invaders in North America, the quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis), is
   imminent in Lake Champlain, United States. An invasion by this filter
   feeder has the potential to drastically alter energy pathways and
   destabilize pelagic fisheries via bottom-up impacts. However, the extent
   and magnitude of these impacts depend on the current food web structure
   of the mid-trophic pelagic food web, which was previously not well
   described. We used Bayesian stable isotope mixing models informed by
   stomach content analysis to identify which energy pathways are currently
   most important to mid-trophic level fishes. We determined that in the
   Main Lake basin, the spring phytoplankton bloom and deep chlorophyll
   layer - the resources most vulnerable to quagga mussels - provide a
   disproportionate amount of support to the pelagic food web via
   zooplankton and the migrating macroinvertebrate Mysis. The food web in
   the Northeast Arm of Lake Champlain is supported by epilimnetic
   phytoplankton, which is more protected from the filtration effects of
   quagga mussels than the deep chlorophyll layer. However, the Northeast
   Arm will likely not provide a high-quality foraging refuge to coldwater
   pelagic fish due to unfavorable oxythermal conditions. The mid-trophic
   food web of Lake Champlain-and consequently piscivores who rely on these
   prey-may be vulnerable to the impending quagga mussel invasion if
   migratory Mysis are not able to shift their diet to benthic resources.",10.3389/fevo.2022.1061636,dreissenid mussels; MixSIAR; alewife; rainbow smelt; Mysis; food webs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

   lowest in the seasonally hypoxic central basin, while Oligochaeta
   densities were relatively consistent throughout Lake Erie. Values of

   patterns of delta N-15 in both taxa were probably related to the greater
   influence of agricultural land uses in the western basin. Spatial trends

   population and community level effects on aquatic biota have been well
   documented, food web responses remain poorly understood and difficult to
   char-acterize. The application of stable isotope analysis (SIA) provides
   a means to assess the effect of dams on food webs. Here we review the
   effect of dams on aquatic food webs using SIA, aiming to detect
   knowledge gaps in the field of dam impacts on aquatic food webs and
   propose a conceptual framework to help formulate hypotheses about dam
   impacts on food webs guided by food web theory. Dams can affect aquatic
   food webs via two pathways: a bottom-up pathway with altered basal food
   sources and their transfer to consumers through changes in flow,
   nutrients, temperature and sediment, and a top-down pathway with
   consumer species composition altered mainly through habitat
   fragmentation and related physiochemical changes. Taking these
   mechanisms into consideration, the impact of dams on food web attributes
   derived from SIA was evaluated. These studies generally apply mixing
   models to determine how dams alter the dominant carbon sources
   supporting food webs, use delta 15N to examine how dams alter food-chain
   length, or use Layman metrics of isotope variability to assess niche
   changes for invertebrate and fish assemblages. Most studies compare the
   patterns of SIA metrics spatially (e.g. upstream vs reservoir vs
   downstream of dams; regulated vs unregulated rivers) and temporally
   (before vs after dam construction), without explicit hypotheses and/or
   links to theoretical concepts of food webs. We propose several steps to
   make SIA studies of dam impacts more rigorous and enhance their
   potential for pro-ducing novel insights. Future studies should quantify
   the shape and strength of the effect of dams on SIA-measured food web

   threaten aquatic ecosystems. Among these invaders, the introduction of
   the European perch (Perca fluviatilis) can have particularly detrimental
   effects on native communities, affecting both ecosystem functioning and
   human well-being. In this study, carbon and nitrogen stable isotope
   analysis was employed, using perch originating from five different
   ecosystems, to model the effects of their hypothetical introduction into
   znik Lake, an economically and ecologically important, biodiversity-rich
   lake in northern Turkey, to ultimately assess their potential predation
   impact and competition with native predators. The results revealed that
   if perch were introduced to the community, they would - considering gape

   perch, could lead to cascading effects throughout the food web, altering

   dynamics from baseline biogeochemical cycling as drivers of the rapid

   These abrupt shifts in penguin delta 15N values and associated
   biogeochemical cycling aligned with climatic events during the Little

   proposed increase in Ekman upwelling via a southward migration of the

   decline in penguin trophic position over the Holocene that began prior
   to both recent anthropogenic climate change and a proposed
   ``krill-surplus{''} following historic marine mammal exploitation in the

   Nutrients, phytoplankton, zooplankton and stable isotope (delta C-13

   attributes of plankton communities and thus alter ecosystem
   trophodynamics. This study compares the mesozooplankton community
   structure in the inner and outer (eastern) Beagle Channel during spring
   and assesses the interactions of the main mesozooplankton trophic groups
   with lower and higher trophic level organisms under an isotopic
   approach. Oceanographic data and biological samples, ranging from
   sediment and phytoplankton to pelagic squat lobsters (Grimothea
   gregaria), were collected along the channel during two research cruises
   conducted in November 2019. Mesozooplankton abundance and taxonomic
   composition differed between sectors, in agreement with their distinct
   environmental conditions. The inner sector was dominated by copepods,
   mainly Clausocalanidae spp., followed by cirripede and echinoderm larvae
   and appendicularians. In the outer sector, with shallower, saltier, and
   warmer waters than the inner one, mesozooplankton abundances were
   notably higher and both copepods and decapod larvae, mainly Peltarion
   spinosulum and G. gregaria zoeae, were dominant. This pattern in
   meroplankton abundance was consistent with the bathymetric distribution
   reported for benthic adults. Betweensector differences in taxonomic
   composition, e.g., Macruronus novaezelandiae (hake) larvae occurring
   only in the outer sector, may be attributed to the higher connectivity
   between this sector and the open ocean and the semi-enclosed character
   of the inner channel. Mesozooplankton spatial variability was partially
   reflected in the isotopic niche width of their different trophic groups
   such as copepods, euphausiids and decapod larvae. However, at the
   community level, trophic attributes (i.e., baseline resources, trophic
   positions, isotopic diversity metrics) were quite similar in the two
   sectors, suggesting similar basal and vertical trophic structures.
   According to Bayesian stable isotope mixing models, most trophic groups,
   including pelagic G. gregaria, rely on phytoplankton as their main
   carbon source. This reveals a weak predation pressure on mesozooplankton
   by the squat lobster and reinforces a bottom-up regulation during the

   However, the importance of these subsidies for food webs and how they
   vary with lake trophic status remains unclear, especially for large
   lakes. We assessed the source and fate of organic matter and nutrients
   in seven perialpine lakes across a gradient of trophic status. We
   measured carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes of amino acids of
   lake-residing Atlantic trout, Salmo trutta, to determine the source of
   primary production (i.e., how carbon is fixed in the ecosystem) and how
   it is transferred through food webs, respectively. Based on essential
   amino acid carbon fingerprinting, we estimated the probability of
   organic carbon originating from autochthonous (algal), allochthonous
   (terrestrial plant), and recycled (bacterial) sources. In addition, we
   used amino acid delta N-15 to track how this primary production is
   transferred to consumers in general, and by using different trophic
   amino acids (glutamic acid and alanine), identify the trophic pathways
   involving either metazoan or protozoans. We found a high likelihood of
   autochthonous origin of organic carbon (86 +/- 9\%) in trout that
   contrasted with allochthonous origins of particulate organic matter and
   some sediments. We showed that those estimates are good proxies of
   source reliance. Our results also highlighted the importance of
   bacterial origin of organic carbon in fish (12\%). The likely
   autochthonous origin of this carbon was supported by trophic markers
   (Ala delta N-15) that suggest the role of protists in transferring
   recycled organic carbon up the food web. While the sources of nitrogen
   sustaining food webs varied among lakes, we found a conserved carbon
   fingerprinting of fish. Overall, this suggests an uncoupling between the
   source of nutrients and organic carbon in large perialpine lakes. Across
   a wide range of trophic status (c. 2 orders of magnitude range of
   phosphorus concentration), several lines of evidence suggested that
   perialpine lake food webs shared a common reliance on autochthonous and

   indicators in Central Appalachian streams",FRONTIERS IN WATER,"Mountaintop removal coal mining (MTR) has been a major source of
   landscape change in the Central Appalachians of the United States (US).
   Changes in stream hydrology, channel geomorphology and water quality
   caused by MTR coal mining can lead to severe impairment of stream
   ecological integrity. The objective of the Clean Water Act (CWA) is to
   restore and maintain the ecological integrity of the Nation's waters.
   Sensitive, readily measured indicators of ecosystem structure and
   function are needed for the assessment of stream ecological integrity.
   Most CWA assessments rely on structural indicators; inclusion of
   functional indicators could make these assessments more holistic and
   effective. The goals of this study were: (1) test the efficacy of
   selected carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling and microbial structural
   and functional indicators for assessing MTR coal mining impacts on
   streams; (2) determine whether indicators respond to impacts in a
   predictable manner; and (3) determine if functional indicators are less
   likely to change than are structural indicators in response to stressors
   associated with MTR coal mining. The structural indicators are water
   quality and sediment organic matter concentrations, and the functional
   indicators relate to microbial activity and biofilm production. Seasonal
   measurements were conducted over the course of a year in streams
   draining small MTR-impacted and forested watersheds in the Twentymile
   Creek watershed of West Virginia (WV). Five of the eight structural
   parameters measured had significant responses, with all means greater in
   the MTR-impacted streams than in the forested streams. These responses
   resulted from changes in source or augmentation of the original source
   of the C and N structural parameters because of MTR coal mining. Nitrate
   concentration and the stable carbon isotopic ratio of dissolved
   inorganic carbon were the most effective indicators evaluated in this
   study. Only three of the fourteen functional indicators measured had
   significant responses to MTR coal mining, with all means greater in the
   forested streams than in the MTR-impacted streams. These results suggest
   that stressors associated with MTR coal mining caused reduction in some
   aspects of microbial cycling, but resource subsidies may have
   counterbalanced some of the inhibition leading to no observable change
   in most of the functional indicators. The detritus base, which is
   thought to confer functional stability, was likely sustained in the
   MTR-impacted streams by channel storage and/or leaf litter inputs from
   their largely intact riparian zones. Overall, our results largely
   support the hypothesis that certain functional processes are more
   resistant to stress induced change than structural properties but also

   nutrient-rich, low-oxygen deep water. To increase our mechanistic
   understanding of how upwelling impacts plankton communities and trophic
   links, we investigated mesozooplankton community succession and gut
   fluorescence, fatty acid and elemental compositions (C, N, O, P), and
   stable isotope (delta C-13, delta N-15) ratios of dominant
   mesozooplankton and microzooplankton representatives in a mesocosm setup
   off Callao (Peru) after simulated upwelling with OMZ water from two
   different locations and different N:P signatures (moderate and extreme
   treatments). An oxycline between 5 and 15 m with hypoxic conditions (<
   50 mu mol L-1) below similar to 10 m persisted in the mesocosms
   throughout the experiment. No treatment effects were determined for the
   measured parameters, but differences in nutrient concentrations
   established through OMZ water additions were only minor. Copepods and
   polychaete larvae dominated in terms of abundance and biomass.
   Development and reproduction of the dominant copepod genera Paracalanus
   sp., Hemicyclops sp., Acartia sp., and Oncaea sp. were hindered as

   mesocosms and poor nutritional condition of copepods suggested from very
   low gut fluorescence and fatty acid compositions most likely explain the
   retarded copepod development. Correlation analysis revealed no
   particular trophic relations between dominant copepods and phytoplankton
   groups. Possibly, particulate organic matter with a relatively high C:N
   ratio was a major diet of copepods. C:N ratios of copepods and
   polychaetes ranged 4.8-5.8 and 4.2-4.3, respectively. delta N-15 was
   comparatively high (similar to 13 parts per thousand -17 parts per
   thousand), potentially because the injected OMZ source water was
   enriched in delta 15N as a result of anoxic conditions. Elemental ratios
   of dinoflagellates deviated strongly from the Redfield ratio. We
   conclude that opportunistic feeding of copepods may have played an
   important role in the pelagic food web. Overall, projected changes in

   used to study benthic OM utilization and food-web structure and to
   assess whether their spatial patterns reflect today's community
   differentiation among biogeographic regions and depth zones. Benthic
   fauna and OM mixtures were collected from two depth zones (100-150 m vs.

   a latitudinal gradient (59-78 degrees N) that was used as a

   results showed that Arctic and temperate communities are functionally
   different. Arctic communities were characterized by a strong resource
   partitioning among different feeding types, irrespective of depth zone.
   In contrast, all feeding types in temperate communities seemed to rely

This trend reflects a concomitant decrease in emphasis on marine resources and increased reliance on C4-based resources, especially maize. This dietary reorientation is most apparent for the early agricultural sample (AD 1150-1300), coinciding with the Mississippian fluorescence in the eastern United States. There is, however, a shift toward the use of C3 (non-maize) foods during the last prehistoric period (AD 1300-1450), which is likely related to environmental stress and social disruption. A heavier use of maize and terrestrial resources in general after the establishment of mission centers on barrier islands is indicated.

The very low δ(15)N values (-7.7 ‰) suggest that (1) Picea mainly uses inorganic nitrogen (probably mainly ammonium) or organic N in fresh litter, (2) Vaccinium (-4.3 ‰) with its ericoid mycorrhizae uses more stable organic matter, and (3) Calamagrostis (+0.9 ‰) exploits deeper soil horizons with higher δ(15)N values of soil N. We conclude that species limited by the same nutrient may coexist by drawing on different pools of soil N in a nutrient-deficient environment. The differences among life-forms decrease with increasing N availability. The different levels of δ(15)N are associated with different nitrogen concentrations in leaves, Picea having a lower N concentration (0.62 mmol g(-1)) than Vaccinium (0.98 mmol g(-1)) or Calamagrostis (1.33 mmol g(-1)). An extended vector analysis by Timmer and Armstrong (1987) suggests that N is the most limiting element for Picea in this habitat, causing needle yellowing at N concentrations below 0.5 mmol g(-1) or N contents below 2 mmol needle(-1). Increasing N supply had an exponential effect on twig and needle growth.

A diet switching experiment utilizing a predatory ladybird beetle, Hippodamia variegata (Goeze), evaluated the use of naturally occurring stable C and N isotopes as an economically feasible and safe method for quantifying pathways of energy flow within agroecosystems. Stable isotope values of the ladybird beetle Coleomegilla maculata lengi (Timberlake) collected from an agroecosystem were used to estimate the relative amount of C and N derived from agricultural plants and incorporated by ladybird beetles based on mass balance equations. At the beginning of the diet-switching experiment δ(13)C and δ(15)N values of H. variegata (-12.0‰ and 6.3‰, respectively) differed by -0.2‰ and 2.9‰ from the aphids that were provided exclusively as their diet. These data are consistent with previous estimates of trophic level isotope effects. After switching the diet of H. variegata to an alternative food, isotope values of H. variegata gradually shifted toward expected values for individuals fed this diet (-22.9‰ and 8.8‰ for δ(13)C and δ(15)N values, respectively). Isotope values of another ladybird beetle, C. maculata, collected from the field indicated that in May, alfalfa and maize (pollen) obtained in the previous year contributed 32% and 68% of the C or N to the diets of these individuals and in August, 52%, 6%, and 42% of the C or N assimilated by these insects was derived from alfalfa, wheat, and maize, respectively. These data are consistent with expectations based on the relative abundance of C. maculata in various crops during the season. The field and laboratory data are a clear indication that isotope values are sensitive to dietary changes on a relatively short time scale (days) and provide a strong basis for the use stable C and N isotope to trace energy flow patterns of these beneficial organisms within agroecosystems.",10.1007/s004420050064 [pii] and 10.1007/s004420050064 [doi],Agroecosystems and Energy flow and Food webs and Key words Stable isotopes and Lady beetles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, cross-system comparisons in delta(15)N can be complicated by differences in delta(15)N at the base of the food chain. Such baseline variation in delta(15)N is difficult to resolve using plankton because of the large temporal variability in the delta(15)N of small organisms that have fast nitrogen turnover. Comparisons using large primary consumers, which have stable tissue isotopic signatures because of their slower nitrogen turnover, show that delta(15)N increases markedly with the human population density in the lake watershed. This shift in delta(15)N likely reflects the high delta(15)N of human sewage. Correcting for this baseline variation in delta(15)N, we report that, contrary to expectations based on previous food-web analysis, the food chains leading up to fish varied by about only one trophic level among the 40 lakes studied.

Furthermore, results of this study suggest that the riverine productivity model (RPM) is more appropriate than the widely known river continuum concept (RCC) for the constricted region of this river. These␣conclusions are based on stable isotope analyses of potential sources of organic matter (riparian C(3) trees, riparian C(4) grasses and agricultural crops, submerged macrophytes, benthic filamentous algae, benthic particulate organic matter, and transported organic matter containing detritus and phytoplankton) and various functional feeding groups of invertebrate and fish consumers. The FPC, which stresses the key contribution of organic matter, particularly terrestrial organic matter, originating from the floodplain to riverine food webs, was judged inappropriate for the floodplain region of the Ohio River for hydrodynamic and biotic reasons. The rising limb and peak period of discharge typically occur in November through March when temperatures are low (generally much less than 10°C) and greater than bank-full conditions are relatively unpredictable and short-lived. The major food potentially available to riverine organisms migrating into the floodplain would be decaying vegetation because autotrophic production is temperature and light limited and terrestrial insect production is minimal at that time. It is clear from our data that terrestrial C(4) plants contribute little, if anything, to the consumer food web (based on δ(13)C values), and δ(15)N values for C(3) plants, coarse benthic organic matter, and fine benthic organic matter were too depleted (∼7-12‰ lower than most invertebrate consumer values) for this organic matter to be supporting the food web. The RPM, which emphasizes the primary role of autotrophic production in large rivers, is the most viable of the remaining two ecosystem models for the constricted-channel region of the Ohio based on stable isotope linkage between sources and consumers of organic matter in the food web. The most important form of food web organic matter is apparently transported (suspended) fine (FTOM) and ultra-fine particulate organic matter. We propose that phytoplankton and detritus of an autochthonous origin in the seston would represent a more usable energy source for benthic (bivalve molluscs, hydropsychid caddisflies) and planktonic (microcrustaceans) suspension feeders than the more refractory allochthonous materials derived from upstream processing of terrestrial organic matter. Benthic grazers depend heavily on nonfilamentous benthic algae (based on gut analysis from a separate study), but filamentous benthic algae have no apparent connection to invertebrate consumers (based on δ(13)C values). Amphipod and crayfish show a strong relationship to aquatic macrophytes (possibly through detrital organic matter rather than living plant tissue). These observations contrast with the prediction of the RCC that food webs in large rivers are based principally on refractory FTOM and dissolved organic matter from upstream inefficiencies in organic-matter processing and the bacteria growing upon these suspended or dissolved detrital compounds. The conclusions drawn here for the Ohio River cannot yet be extended to other floodplain and constricted-channel rivers in temperate and tropical latitudes until more comparable data are available on relatively pristine and moderately regulated rivers.",10.1007/s004420050692 [pii] and 10.1007/s004420050692 [doi],Flood pulse concept and Key words Food webs and Ohio River and River continuum concept and Stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From continuous measurements made across a 36-h period from three heights within the forest canopy, we generated mixing lines (Keeling plots) for δ(a)(13)CO(2), δ(a) C(18)O(16)O and δ(a) H(2)(18)O, to derive the isotopic composition of the signal being released from forest to atmosphere. These were compared directly with measurements of different respective pools within the forest system, i.e. δ(13)C of organic matter input for δ(a)(13)CO(2), δ(18)O of exchangeable water for δ(a) C(18)O(16)O and transpired water vapour for δ(a) H(2)(18)O. [CO(2)] and δ(a)(13)CO(2) showed strong coupling, where the released CO(2) was, on average, 4 per mil enriched compared to the organic matter of plant material in the system, suggesting either fractionation of organic material before eventual release as soil-respired CO(2), or temporal differences in ecosystem discrimination. δ(a) C(18)O(16)O was less well coupled to [CO(2)], probably due to the heterogeneity and transient nature of water pools (soil, leaf and moss) within the forest. Similarly, δ(a) H(2)(18)O was less coupled to [H(2)O], again reflecting the transient nature of water transpired to the forest, seen as uncoupling during times of large changes in vapour pressure deficit. The δ(18)O of transpired water vapour, inferred from both mixing lines at the canopy scale and direct measurement at the leaf level, approximated that of source water, confirming that an isotopic steady state held for the forest integrated over the daily cycle. This demonstrates that isotopic coupling of CO(2) and water vapour within a forest canopy will depend on absolute differences in the isotopic composition of the respective pools involved in exchange and on the stability of each of these pools with time.",10.1007/s004420050766 [pii] and 10.1007/s004420050766 [doi],CO2 and Carbon and Forest canopies and Key words Stable isotopes and Water vapour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Isotope ratios of carbon (delta(13)C) and nitrogen (delta(15)N) were monitored simultaneously in body tissue and mucus for up to 101 days in feeding or fasting Lumbricus festivus kept in an artificial substrate. When the diet of the earthworms was switched from clover (C(3) plant, legume) to maize (C(4), non-legume), the new dietary delta(13)C signature manifested itself much more rapidly in the mucus than in the body tissue of the animals, causing a delta(13)C shift of about 4 per thousand in mucus and 1 per thousand in tissue after 13.5 days. Turnover of earthworm body tissue carbon, unlike that of mucus carbon, was described adequately by an exponential, single-pool model. Nitrogen turnover could not be assessed because the delta(15)N difference between sources was too small. Fasting for 56 days did not result in the expected whole-body (15)N or (13)C enrichment, but it caused a significant decrease in mucus and tissue C:N ratios and in the ratio (mucus C:N ratio):(tissue C:N ratio). We conclude that the separate analysis of body tissue and mucus has great potential for studying the ecophysiology, feeding ecology and role in elemental cycling of earthworms and other invertebrates.",10.1007/s004420050697 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lake trout were also collected from three isolated lake systems (Lakes Nipigon, Simcoe and Opeongo), all located within the basin. All the samples were analysed for body burdens of total toxaphene and 22 toxaphene congeners. In addition, from each of the Great Lakes sites samples of major invertebrate dietary items, which included Mysis relicta, Diporeia hoyi and plankton, were similarly analysed. Whole lake trout samples, archived at -80 degrees C, were reanalysed to determine historical trends of toxaphene congeners plus carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures. The Lake Superior food web consistently had the highest levels of total toxaphene of all the Great Lakes monitored. The primary source of toxaphene to Lake Superior has been identified as atmospheric transport and deposition from sites in the southern US, Mexico and Central America (Hoff, R.M., Strachan, W.M.J., Sweet, C.W., Chan, C.H., Shackelton, M., Bidleman, T.F., Brice, K.A., Burnison, D.A., Cussion, S., Gatz, D.F., Harlin, K., Schroeder, W.H., 1996.

Stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon were analyzed in samples and used to establish trophic structure of the food web and to determine the importance of atmospheric versus sedimentary sources in delivering PCBs to the food web. Nitrogen isotopes were confounded by multiple variables in this system, particularly seasonal variation, and did not display a simple pattern of enrichment among trophic levels. However, delta13C displayed little seasonal variation and was positively correlated with PCB concentrations among food web members (r2 = 0.69). Plots of delta13C vs PCBs separate food web members into three distinct groupings comprised of invertebrates, primary forage fish, and predatory fish. Stable isotope values of the primary organic sources indicate that the atmosphere, and not the sediment, is the most likely source of PCBs to the food web of Lake Michigan. Additionally, we suggest that seston may be important in delivering PCBs to pelagic food web members and species that receive a majority of their nutrition through pelagic sources. In contrast, settling particles are implicated in delivering PCBs to benthic organisms and Mysis relicta.",10.1021/es0019225 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pygmy grasshoppers (Paratettix aztecus and P. mexicanus; Tetrigidae) graze river algae stranded along shorelines of the South Fork Eel River in northern California (39°44'N, 123°39'W) as the river recedes during the summer drought. Densities of tetrigids during the mid to late summer were highest (1 individual/m(2) in July) within 1 m of the river margin, and declined to near zero at 4 m from the margin, especially during peak temperatures in the afternoon. These observations suggested that the distribution of tetrigids was determined by the availability of algae, water, or both. We manipulated the presence/absence of water and beached algae (Cladophora glomerata) in a 2×2 factorial design. All treatments were positioned 2 m upslope from the river's edge (about 30 cm above the water table), where the cobble bar was naturally dry and devoid of algae and densities of tetrigids were lower than at the river margin (0.4 individuals/m(2) in July). Tetrigids responded only to the wet Cladophora treatment, which had 30× higher densities than other treatments. Stable isotopic signatures (δ(13)C) of tetrigids (-19.7‰) collected from the same cobble bars were more similar to those of epilithic algae (-20.4‰) than terrestrial plants (-28.2‰), and higher than those of acridid grasshoppers (-27.9‰) from the same habitats. Mixing models suggest that 88-100% of the C in tetrigid grasshoppers at our study site is derived from riverine algae. A preliminary analysis suggests that tetrigids ingested sufficient quantities of algae to easily meet their energetic demands during the summer. This study supports the idea that algae, produced in stream systems, can determine the distribution and relative abundance of a common terrestrial scavenger and provide an additional pathway for energy exchange between rivers and riparian food webs.",10.1007/s00442-002-0879-7 [pii] and 10.1007/s00442-002-0879-7 [doi],Pygmy grasshopper and Riparian and River-watershed exchange and Subsidy and Tetrigidae,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Eimers, M Catherine and Evans, R Douglas and Welbourn, P M",2002,Partitioning and bioaccumulation of cadmium in artificial sediment systems: application of a stable isotope tracer technique.,Chemosphere,"The utility of stable isotope tracers for investigating the relationship between cadmium (Cd) partitioning in artificial sediment-water systems and Cd accumulation in a benthic detritivore (Asellus racovitzai, Isopoda) was explored. In the laboratory, Cd isotopes were applied to synthetic sediment and isotope concentrations were measured in sediment, overlying water and exposed asellids over a 10-day period. Isotope ratios measured in sediment and water were compared to ratios measured in asellids to determine whether Cd partitioning could predict metal bioaccumulation. Two different parameters which might affect Cd partitioning between the sediment and overlying water compartments were investigated: the chemical form in which Cd was added to systems, and the organic matter content of the sediment. To test the effect of chemical form on Cd partitioning, three isotopes of cadmium were individually applied to formulated sediment in varying combinations of 113Cd(NO3)2, 112Cd-humic acid (HA) 114CdSO4. The results demonstrated that chemical form did not influence partitioning, as the Cd isotope that was applied to sediment in the nitrate form exhibited similar partitioning between sediment and overlying water as the isotope that was applied in the sulfate or HA form. However, Cd isotope concentrations in overlying water were strongly related to the pattern of isotope accumulation in asellids suggesting that overlying water concentrations determined Cd bioaccumulation. In contrast, when the organic matter content of sediment was increased through the addition of Sphagnum peat moss, total Cd concentrations in overlying water and tissue were low, and there was no relationship between Cd-isotope concentrations in tissue and water. These results indicate that Cd accumulation occurred primarily from water, and factors that increase metal partitioning to sediment, such as increased sediment organic matter content, decrease Cd accumulation in asellids. The stable isotope tracer method described herein appears to be a useful technique for investigating the relationship between metal partitioning and bioaccumulation in simple sediment systems, but could also be extended to more complex systems, and used with different metals that have multiple stable isotopes.",S0045-6535(01)00156-4 [pii] and 10.1016/s0045-6535(01)00156-4 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the simultaneous uptake and elimination of cadmium (Cd) in stream-dwelling caddisfly (Trichoptera: Hydropsychidae) larvae was measured in laboratory experiments with stable isotopes of Cd. In one experiment, animals were exposed to low levels (0.5 microg/L) of 114Cd in filtered river water and uptake was measured for 9 d, followed by 9 d during which the larvae were exposed to either 114Cd, 113Cd, or filtered river water. In a second experiment, the initial exposure concentration of 114Cd varied from 0.1 to 1.6 microg/L for 5 d, followed by 5 d during which the larvae were exposed to the same respective levels of 113Cd. The purpose of the two experiments was to test whether or not elimination of 114Cd from Hydropsyche larvae was the same in the presence or absence of Cd in the water and also whether or not elimination rates were dependent on exposure concentration. The results indicated that elimination of Cd by Hydropsyche larvae (elimination rate constant approximately 0.21-0.24/d) in the presence of Cd in the water was the same as the depuration when no metal was present. Furthermore, the elimination rate was independent of exposure concentrations, ranging between 0.1 and 1.6 microg/L. Thus, the stable isotope tracer technique enabled the simultaneous measurement of uptake and elimination of Cd in hydropsychid larvae and may have the potential to facilitate the labeling of various compartments (e.g., water, sediment, and food) in the aquatic environment.",NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But by the 1940s, an upward trend towards recovery was apparent and continued to their current stable population levels. These dramatic fluctuations in kite numbers may have been related to changes in rodent prey populations due to the conversion of native habitats to agriculture. To address this question, we evaluated the use of stable isotope analysis in determining if a shift in diet could be isotopically differentiated in current and historic kite populations. We first compared delta13C, delta15N, and delta34S values from present-day kite flight feathers and prey fur samples from four locations in California. The total ranges of isotope values for kite and their rodent prey were similar within each site. Carbon isotope values ranged from -27.1 to -22.2 per thousand in Arcata, -26.1 to -16.9 per thousand in Davis, -27.0 to -15.0 per thousand in Cosumnes, and -28.2 to -11.6 per thousand in Santa Barbara. Nitrogen isotope values ranged from 3.2 to 15.7 per thousand in Arcata, 2.8 to 12.7 per thousand in Davis, 4.0 to 15.7 per thousand in Cosumnes, and 1.7 to 20.0 per thousand in Santa Barbara. Sulfur isotope values ranged from -7.8 to 12.4 per thousand in Arcata, -1.1 to 9.2 per thousand in Davis, 0.7 to 10.9 per thousand in Cosumnes, and -8.6 to 15.6 per thousand in Santa Barbara. Carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur isotope values at each site reflect typical trophic enrichments due to physiological processes. At each site, delta13C and delta15N values reflected the influence of a predominantly C3 or a mixed C3/C4 plant community. Sulfur isotope values reflect the influence of predominant marine or terrestrial sulfur sources at each site. However, variability in isotope values may limit the usefulness of such analyses for addressing prey utilization and population dynamics.",10.1080/1025601031000108679 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OC distributions in these compartments have been determined to assess theirtransport routes into fish. Food diets have been estimated by analysis of fish stomach content and food web stable isotopes (delta13C and delta15N). OCs with octanol--water partition coefficient (Kow) higher than 10(6) showed lower concentrations in food than expected from theoretical octanol--water partition, indicating thatthe distribution of these compounds does not reach equilibrium within the life span of the food web organisms (ca. 1 year). On the other hand, the degree of biomagnification in fish increased with Kow, except in the case of the largest compound analyzed (seven chlorine substituents, PCB #180). OC exchange at fish gill and gut has been evaluated using a fugacity model based on the water, food, and fish concentrations. All compounds exhibited a net gill loss and a net gut uptake. A pseudostationary state was only achieved for compounds with log(Kow) < 6.

Macrophyte delta15N values increased with wastewater input and water-column dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentration. When macrophytes were divided into macroalgae and plants, they responded similarly to increases in wastewater N, although macroalgae was a more reliable indicator of both wastewater inputs and water-column DIN concentrations. Smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora Loisel.) Delta15N increased uniformly with wastewater inputs across a geographic range.

"Stewart, A Robin and Luoma, Samuel N and Schlekat, Christian E and Doblin, Martina A and Hieb, Kathryn A",2004,Food web pathway determines how selenium affects aquatic ecosystems: a San Francisco Bay case study.,Environmental science & technology,"Chemical contaminants disrupt ecosystems, but specific effects may be under-appreciated when poorly known processes such as uptake mechanisms, uptake via diet, food preferences, and food web dynamics are influential. Here we show that a combination of food web structure and the physiology of trace element accumulation explain why some species in San Francisco Bay are threatened by a relatively low level of selenium contamination and some are not. Bivalves and crustacean zooplankton form the base of two dominant food webs in estuaries. The dominant bivalve Potamocorbula amurensis has a 10-fold slower rate constant of loss for selenium than do common crustaceans such as copepods and the mysid Neomysis mercedis (rate constant of loss, ke = 0.025, 0.155, and 0.25 d(-1), respectively). The result is much higher selenium concentrations in the bivalve than in the crustaceans. Stable isotope analyses show that this difference is propagated up the respective food webs in San Francisco Bay. Several predators of bivalves have tissue concentrations of selenium that exceed thresholds thought to be associated with teratogenesis or reproductive failure (liver Se >15 microg g(-1) dry weight). Deformities typical of selenium-induced teratogenesis were observed in one of these species. Concentrations of selenium in tissues of predators of zooplankton are less than the thresholds. Basic physiological and ecological processes can drive wide differences in exposure and effects among species, but such processes are rarely considered in traditional evaluations of contaminant impacts.",10.1021/es0499647 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No nitrification activity was measured between spit applications of N fertilizer. However, nitrification was induced upon nitrogen amendment in intact soil cores. Despite induction by nitrogen amendment, the loss of nitrogen through coupled nitrification-denitrification was less than 10% of the plant nitrogen uptake.

This study examined Hg and stable C and N isotopic composition of baleen plates of the North Atlantic minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), which continues to be a food source for people in Greenland and elsewhere. We compared the Hg levels and stable isotopes of major tissues (kidney, liver and muscle) with those of baleen plates to see whether baleen could be used as a biomonitor of variations of Hg intake and diet both between individuals and within individuals over time. Mercury was significantly correlated with concentrations in all tissues (kidney, liver and muscle). Stable C and N isotopes in baleen were generally similar to those of muscle, which reflects the recent (approximately one month) feeding of the whale, but in some individuals there were significant differences between baleen and muscle. Sectioning of baleen into 1 cm longitudinal increments showed that these differences were due to marked dietary shifts by some individuals over time that had been recorded in the baleen but were lost from the muscle record. Whole baleen C and N isotopes were better correlated with tissue Hg levels, suggesting that baleen may provide a more reliable indicator of long-term average diet, which in turn may be better related to Hg accumulation in tissues than the shorter-term diet record contained in muscle.",S0048-9697(04)00203-7 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2004.03.024 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wissel, Björn and Fry, Brian",2005,Tracing Mississippi River influences in estuarine food webs of coastal Louisiana.,Oecologia,"The Breton Sound estuary in southern Louisiana receives large amounts of Mississippi River water via a controlled diversion structure at the upstream end of the estuary. We used stable isotopes to trace spatial and seasonal responses of the downstream food web to winter and spring introductions of river water. Analysis of delta13C, delta15N, and delta34S in the common local consumers such as grass shrimp (Palaemonetes sp.), barnacles (Balanus sp.), and small plankton-feeding fish (bay anchovies, Anchoa mitchilli) showed that the diversion was associated with two of the five major source regimes that were supporting food webs: a river regime near the diversion and a river-influenced productive marsh regime farther away from the diversion. Mixing models identified a third river-influenced source regime at the marine end of the estuary where major natural discharge from the Bird's Foot Delta wraps around into estuarine waters. The remaining two source regimes represented typical estuarine conditions: local freshwater sources especially from precipitation and a brackish source regime representing higher salinity marine influences. Overall, the Mississippi River diversion accounted for 75% of food web support in the upper estuary and 25% in the middle estuary, with influence strongest along known flow pathways and closest to the diversion. Isotopes also traced seasonal changes in river contributions, and indicated increased plant community productivity along the major flow path of diversion water. In the Breton Sound estuary, bottom-up forcing of food webs is strongly linked to river introductions and discharge, occurring in spatial and temporal patterns predictable from known river input regimes and known hydrologic circulation patterns.",10.1007/s00442-005-0119-z [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While CO(2) stimulates net primary production, O(3) reduces photosynthesis, altering plant C allocation and reducing ecosystem C storage. The effects of multiple air pollutants can alter belowground C allocation, leading to changes in the partial pressure of CO(2) (pCO(2)) in the soil , chemistry of dissolved inorganic carbonate (DIC) and the rate of mineral weathering. As this system represents a linkage between the long- and short-term C cycles and sequestration of atmospheric CO(2), changes in atmospheric chemistry that affect net primary production may alter the fate of C in these ecosystems. To date, little is known about the combined effects of elevated CO(2) and O(3) on the inorganic C cycle in forest systems. Free air CO(2) and O(3) enrichment (FACE) technology was used at the Aspen FACE project in Rhinelander, Wisconsin to understand how elevated atmospheric CO(2) and O(3) interact to alter pCO(2) and DIC concentrations in the soil. Ambient and elevated CO(2) levels were 360+/-16 and 542+/-81 microl l(-1), respectively; ambient and elevated O(3) levels were 33+/-14 and 49+/-24 nl l(-1), respectively. Measured concentrations of soil CO(2) and calculated concentrations of DIC increased over the growing season by 14 and 22%, respectively, under elevated atmospheric CO(2) and were unaffected by elevated tropospheric O(3). The increased concentration of DIC altered inorganic carbonate chemistry by increasing system total alkalinity by 210%, likely due to enhanced chemical weathering. The study also demonstrated the close coupling between the seasonal delta(13)C of soil pCO(2) and DIC, as a mixing model showed that new atmospheric CO(2) accounted for approximately 90% of the C leaving the system as DIC. This study illustrates the potential of using stable isotopic techniques and FACE technology to examine long- and short-term ecosystem C sequestration.",10.1007/s00442-004-1665-5 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used stable C and N isotope ratios to elucidate trophic relationships between C. pengoi, zooplankton (microzooplankton, 90-200 microm, mostly copepod nauplii and rotifers; mesozooplankton, >200 microm, mostly copepods), and zooplanktivorous fish (herring, size range 5-15 cm and sprat, 9-11 cm) in a coastal area of the northern Baltic Sea. The isotope ratios in C. pengoi and fish were much higher than those of zooplankton, showing general trends of enrichment with trophic level. Young-of-the-year (YOY) herring had a significantly higher (15)N/(14)N ratio than C. pengoi, suggesting of a trophic linkage between the two species. To evaluate the possible relative importance of different food sources for C. pengoi and YOY herring, two-source isotope-mixing models for N were used, with micro- and mesozooplankton as prey for C. pengoi and mesozooplankton and C. pengoi as prey for YOY herring. These models indicate that mesozooplankton was the major food source of both species. However, microzooplankton may be important prey for young stages of C. pengoi. Comparative analyses of the herring trophic position before and after the invasion by C. pengoi showed a trophic level shift from 2.6 to 3.4, indicating substantial alterations in the food web structure. Our findings contribute to a growing body of evidence, showing that C. pengoi can modify food webs and trophic interactions in invaded ecosystems.",10.1007/s00442-004-1791-0 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hair of NJA bears, which did not have access to anthropogenic foods, showed lower values of d13C and d15N than that of NC bears which had access to garbage and corn fields, especially during the summer. These results reflect somewhat differing diets between the NJA and NC bears. We attempted to assess the feeding history during the hair growth cycle using the growth section analysis method. Each hair sample had been cut into 3?mm lengths from root to tip, labeled, and analyzed along the hair growth. We measured the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of each 3?mm length of hair sample from one NC bear which had been killed while raiding a corn field. The sections showed wide ranges of isotope ratios, from -23.2% to -14.6% for delta13C, and from 0.3% to 4.6% for delta15N. It was shown that the diet of this bear shifted dramatically from principally C3 plants to more C4 plants and to foods of animal origin. An analysis of the whole hair reflects just the average feeding habit during hair growth, but the present method can trace its diet history. This method can contribute to obtain precise ecological information of wildlife.",Q0V4L55503617361 [pii] and 10.1080/10256010412331304211 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pickhardt, Paul C and Folt, Carol L and Chen, Celia Y and Klaue, Bjoern and Blum, Joel D",2005,Impacts of zooplankton composition and algal enrichment on the accumulation of mercury in an experimental freshwater food web.,The Science of the total environment,"There is a well documented accumulation of mercury in fish to concentrations of concern for human consumption. Variation in fish Hg burden between lakes is often high and may result from differences in Hg transfer through lower levels of the food web where mercury is bioconcentrated to phytoplankton and transferred to herbivorous zooplankton. Prior research derived patterns of mercury accumulation in freshwater invertebrates from field collected animals. This study provides results from controlled mesocosm experiments comparing the effects of zooplankton composition, algal abundance, and the chemical speciation of mercury on the ability of zooplankton to accumulate mercury from phytoplankton and transfer that mercury to planktivores. Experiments were conducted in 550-L mesocosms across a gradient of algal densities manipulated by inorganic nutrient additions. Enriched, stable isotopes of organic (CH3(200HgCl)) and inorganic (201HgCl2) mercury were added to mesocosms and their concentrations measured in water, seston, and three common zooplankton species. After 2 weeks, monomethylmercury (MMHg) concentrations were two to three times lower in the two copepod species, Leptodiaptomus minutus and Mesocyclops edax than in the cladoceran, Daphnia mendotae. All three zooplankton species had higher MMHg concentrations in mesocosms with low versus high initial algal abundance. However, despite higher concentrations of inorganic mercury (HgI) in seston from low nutrient mesocosms, there were no significant differences in the HgI accumulated by zooplankton across nutrient treatments. Bioaccumulation factors for MMHg in the plankton were similar to those calculated for plankton in natural lakes and a four-compartment (aqueous, seston, macrozooplankton, and periphyton/sediments) mass balance model after 21 days accounted for approximately 18% of the CH3(200Hg) and approximately 33% of the 201Hg added. Results from our experiments corroborate results from field studies and suggest the importance of particular zooplankton herbivores (e.g., Daphnia) in the transfer of Hg to higher trophic levels in aquatic food webs.",S0048-9697(04)00572-8 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2004.07.025 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Long, Eric S and Sweitzer, Richard A and Diefenbach, Duane R and Ben-David, Merav",2005,Controlling for anthropogenically induced atmospheric variation in stable carbon isotope studies.,Oecologia,"Increased use of stable isotope analysis to examine food-web dynamics, migration, transfer of nutrients, and behavior will likely result in expansion of stable isotope studies investigating human-induced global changes. Recent elevation of atmospheric CO2 concentration, related primarily to fossil fuel combustion, has reduced atmospheric CO2 delta13C (13C/12C), and this change in isotopic baseline has, in turn, reduced plant and animal tissue delta13C of terrestrial and aquatic organisms. Such depletion in CO2 delta13C and its effects on tissue delta13C may introduce bias into delta13C investigations, and if this variation is not controlled, may confound interpretation of results obtained from tissue samples collected over a temporal span. To control for this source of variation, we used a high-precision record of atmospheric CO2 delta13C from ice cores and direct atmospheric measurements to model modern change in CO2 delta13C. From this model, we estimated a correction factor that controls for atmospheric change; this correction reduces bias associated with changes in atmospheric isotopic baseline and facilitates comparison of tissue delta13C collected over multiple years. To exemplify the importance of accounting for atmospheric CO2 delta13C depletion, we applied the correction to a dataset of collagen delta13C obtained from mountain lion (Puma concolor) bone samples collected in California between 1893 and 1995. Before correction, in three of four ecoregions collagen delta13C decreased significantly concurrent with depletion of atmospheric CO2 delta13C (n > or = 32, P < or = 0.01). Application of the correction to collagen delta13C data removed trends from regions demonstrating significant declines, and measurement error associated with the correction did not add substantial variation to adjusted estimates. Controlling for long-term atmospheric variation and correcting tissue samples for changes in isotopic baseline facilitate analysis of samples that span a large temporal range.",10.1007/s00442-005-0181-6 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gratton, Claudio and Denno, Robert F",2006,Arthropod food web restoration following removal of an invasive wetland plant.,Ecological applications : a publication of the Ecological Society of America,"Restoration of habitats impacted by invasive plants is becoming an increasingly important tool in the management of native biodiversity, though most studies do not go beyond monitoring the abundance of particular taxonomic groups, such as the return of native vegetation. Yet, the reestablishment of trophic interactions among organisms in restored habitats is equally important if we are to monitor and understand how ecosystems recover. This study examined whether food web interactions among arthropods (as inferred by abundance of naturally occurring stable isotopes of C [delta13C] and N [delta15N]) were reestablished in the restoration of a coastal Spartina alterniflora salt marsh that had been invaded by Phragmites australis. From patterns of C and N stable isotopes we infer that trophic interactions among arthropods in the native salt marsh habitats are characterized by reliance on the dominant marsh plant Spartina as a basal resource. Herbivores such as delphacid planthoppers and mirid bugs have isotope signatures characteristic of Spartina, and predatory arthropods such as dolicopodid flies and spiders likewise have delta13C and delta15N signatures typical of Spartina-derived resources (approximately -13 per thousand and 10 per thousand, respectively). Stable isotope patterns also suggest that the invasion of Phragmites into salt marshes and displacement of Spartina significantly alter arthropod food web interactions. Arthropods in Phragmites-dominated sites have delta13C isotope values between -18 per thousand and -20 per thousand, suggesting reliance on detritus and/or benthic microalgae as basal resources and not on Phragmites, which has a delta13C approximately -26 per thousand. Since most Phragmites herbivores are either feeding internally or are rare transients from nearby Spartina, these resources do not provide significant prey resources for other arthropod consumers. Rather, predator isotope signatures in the invaded habitats indicate dependence on detritus/algae as basal resources instead of the dominant vegetation. The reestablishment of Spartina after removal of Phragmites, however, not only returned species assemblages typical of reference (uninvaded) Spartina, but stable isotope signatures suggest that the trophic interactions among the arthropods were also similar in reestablished habitats. Specifically, both herbivores and predators showed characteristic Spartina signatures, suggesting the return of the original grazer-based food web structure in the restored habitats.",10.1890/1051-0761(2006)016[0622:afwrfr]2.0.co;2 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Levin, Lisa A and Neira, Carlos and Grosholz, Edwin D",2006,Invasive cordgrass modifies wetland trophic function.,Ecology,"Vascular plants strongly control belowground environments in most ecosystems. Invasion by vascular plants in coastal wetlands, and by cordgrasses (Spartina spp.) in particular, are increasing in incidence globally, with dramatic ecosystem-level consequences. We examined the trophic consequences of invasion by a Spartina hybrid (S. alterniflora x S. foliosa) in San Francisco Bay (USA) by documenting differences in biomass and trophic structure of benthic communities between sediments invaded by Spartina and uninvaded sediments. We found the invaded system shifted from an algae-based to a detritus-based food web. We then tested for a relationship between diet and tolerance to invasion, hypothesizing that species that consume Spartina detritus are more likely to inhabit invaded sediments than those that consume surface algae. Infaunal diets were initially examined with natural abundance stable isotope analyses and application of mixing models, but these yielded an ambiguous picture of food sources. Therefore, we conducted isotopic enrichment experiments by providing 15N-labeled Spartina detritus both on and below the sediment surface in areas that either contained Spartina or were unvegetated. Capitellid and nereid polychaetes, and oligochaetes, groups shown to persist following Spartina invasion of San Francisco Bay tidal flats, took up 15N from labeled native and invasive Spartina detritus. In contrast, we found that amphipods, bivalves, and other taxa less tolerant to invasion consumed primarily surficial algae, based on 13C enrichment experiments. Habitat (Spartina vs. unvegetated patches) and location of detritus (on or within sediments) did not affect 15N uptake from detritus. Our investigations support a ""trophic shift"" model for ecosystem response to wetland plant invasion and preview loss of key trophic support for fishes and migratory birds by shifting dominance to species not widely consumed by species at higher trophic levels.",10.1890/04-1752 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Albers, Derk and Schaefer, Matthias and Scheu, Stefan",2006,Incorporation of plant carbon into the soil animal food web of an arable system.,Ecology,"We used stable isotopes to examine the incorporation of plant carbon into the belowground food web of an agricultural system. Plots were established and planted with maize (Zea mays) in a rye field (Secale cereale) near Göttingen (northern Germany) in May 1999. In October 1999, April 2000, and October 2000, meso- and macrofauna and maize and rye litter were collected in each plot and analyzed for 13C and 15N content. 15N signatures suggested that the soil animal species analyzed span three trophic levels with the trophic position of species varying little in time. The species investigated formed a continuum from primary to secondary decomposers to predators. On average, predator species differed from primary and secondary decomposers by 3.9 sigma15N suggesting that they fed on a mixed diet of both decomposer groups. The combined analysis of 13C and 15N signatures allowed us to identify links between prey and consumer species. In October 1999, shortly after maize residues had been incorporated into the plots, maize-born carbon was present in each of the animal species investigated, including top predators. The incorporation of maize carbon into the belowground food web increased during the following 12 months but the concentration of maize-born carbon never exceeded 50% in any of the species. Furthermore, the ranks of the incorporation of maize-born carbon of the species changed little. The results suggest that the belowground food web relies heavily on carbon originating from plant residues from before the recent two growing seasons. In most species the amount of maize-born carbon increased continuously; however, in some species it decreased during winter, suggesting that these species switched to a diet based more on C3 plants during winter, or predominantly metabolized carbon incorporated during the last growing season. The study documents that the combined analysis of 13C and 15N signatures in soil invertebrate species, after replacement of C3 by C4 plants, is a powerful tool to better understand the structure of the belowground food web and the flux of carbon through it.",10.1890/04-1728 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Isotopically identified range shifts were corroborated by global positioning system radio tracking data of the studied individuals. Comparison of the stable isotope record in the hair of one migrant individual with that of a resident population shows important differences in feeding and ranging behavior over time.

Both treatments had a negative effect on delta13C values which may reflect changes in carbon fluxes across food webs in the treated ponds associated with a shift in phytoplankton structure. A decrease in delta15N values was observed in the nymphs collected in mixture-treated ponds, which was presumably due to an increase in the abundance of rotifers and Chironominae larvae in these ponds.

"McIntyre, Peter B and Flecker, Alexander S",2006,Rapid turnover of tissue nitrogen of primary consumers in tropical freshwaters.,Oecologia,"Stable isotopes are widely used as time-integrating tracers of trophic interactions, but turnover rates of isotopes in animal tissues remain poorly understood. Here, we report nitrogen (N) isotope turnover rates in tissues of four primary consumer species: Ancistrus triradiatus armored catfish (muscle, fins, and whole blood), Tarebia granifera snails (muscle), and Rana palmipes tadpoles (muscle) from a Venezuelan river, and Lavigeria grandis snails (muscle) from Lake Tanganyika, East Africa. Turnover was estimated from the dilution of a 15N label introduced into consumer tissues by feeding on 15N-enriched periphyton. Muscle turnover rates were rapid (0.5-3.8% per day), and were attributable to metabolic replacement of N as well as growth in catfish and snails. N turnover in catfish muscle decreased with size, and fin tissue turned over more rapidly than whole blood or muscle, though the difference was not significant. Our results indicate that stable isotope signatures of these tropical species could change markedly within weeks following a shift in diet. However, generalization across taxa or latitudes is complicated by the strong size-dependence of isotope turnover rates. The enrichment-dilution approach outlined here may facilitate measurement of isotopic turnover in a wide variety of consumers under field conditions.",10.1007/s00442-005-0354-3 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Maros, Alexandra and Louveaux, Alain and Lelarge, Caroline and Girondot, Marc",2006,Evidence of the exploitation of marine resource by the terrestrial insect Scapteriscus didactylus through stable isotope analyzes of its cuticle.,BMC ecology,"BACKGROUND: About 4 x 10(5) eggs in more than 5000 marine turtle nests are deposited every year on a 3.6 km long beach in French Guiana (South America). The dry biomass of eggs is estimated to be 5 x 10(3) kg, yet only 25% of this organic matter will return to the ocean in the form of hatchlings. Such amounts of organic matter are supposed to drive the functioning of the beach ecosystem. Previous studies have shown that egg predators and detritivorous organisms dominate the trophic relationships and the dynamics of the system. The role of a terrestrial insect Scapteriscus didactylus (Latreille), which damages up to 40% of the eggs of the marine turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), was unexpected. However it was impossible from direct observations to prove that the mole cricket consumed a significant amount of these eggs. Therefore, the precise place of the mole cricket in the nitrogen and carbon cycles of the beach ecosystem could not be determined. In order to answer this question, we looked for a marine signature of carbon and nitrogen source metabolized by the mole cricket. RESULTS: This study estimated the individual variability of delta13C and delta15N in the cuticle of Scapteriscus didactylus. The isotopic signature was compared between individuals collected at two sites: a village where mole crickets fed on human food scraps and the nearby Awala-Yalimapo beach, where food availability depends seasonally on the nesting sea turtles. The mole crickets collected near the habitations garbage showed no significant variations in the stable isotopic signature, within-and between age groups. On the contrary, isotopic values shifted from a signature of a terrestrial herbivorous diet in the mole crickets during early developmental stages, to isotopic values in adults in accordance with the exploitation of marine animal resources. CONCLUSION: The heterogeneity of individual signatures during the year is due to a selective exploitation of the food sources, differing in space and time. Some individuals, from the beach sample consumed a sufficient quantity of turtle eggs to induce the increase of isotopic enrichment observed in the cuticle. Scapteriscus didactylus is an opportunist feeder and plays a role in the turn over of the beach organic matter.",1472-6785-6-6 [pii] and 10.1186/1472-6785-6-6 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Crait, Jamie R and Ben-David, Merav",2007,Effects of river otter activity on terrestrial plants in trophically altered Yellowstone Lake.,Ecology,"Animals that deposit aquatically derived nutrients on terrestrial landscapes link food webs and affect a variety of in situ processes. This phenomenon, however, is poorly documented in freshwater habitats, especially where species introductions have drastically changed an ecosystem's trophic structure. In this study, we used stable isotopes to document water-to-land nutrient transport by river otters (Lontra canadensis) around Yellowstone Lake, an ecosystem recently altered by nonnative species invasions. We then investigated the effects of otter fertilization on plant growth and prevalence at latrine (scent-marking) sites and evaluated how the recent changes to the lake's food web could influence these plant responses. Values of delta15N were higher on latrines compared to non-latrine sites in five of seven sample plant taxa. Additionally, latrine grasses had higher percentage N than those from non-latrines. Foliar delta15N positively related to fecal deposition rate for some plants, indicating that increased otter scent-marking led to a rise in these N values. Logistic regression models indicated that otters selected for well-shaded latrines with access to foraging. Atypical latrines, misclassified as non-latrines by the regression models, had values of delta15N similar to correctly classified latrines, suggesting that site effects alone cannot explain elevated N values at otter latrine sites. No difference in plant diversity or percent cover of N-fixing taxa occurred between latrine and nonlatrine sites, though specific genera did differ between site types. Measurements of shoot lengths indicated increased growth of some latrine currants (Ribes sp.). In Yellowstone Lake, a twofold reduction in otter numbers could result in an even greater decline in nutrient deposition at latrines, as otters may become less social in a system with decreased prey availability. Our results highlight the role of animals in linking aquatic and terrestrial habitats in inland freshwater systems and suggest that ongoing changes in the trophic structure of Yellowstone Lake could have unexpected ramifications well beyond the lake itself.",10.1890/06-0078 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Values of the delta(15)N were used as an index of trophic position in four length groups and compared to actual stomach contents. The diet of C. gariepinus within the length range of 201-600 mm L(T) mainly consisted of the small barb Barbus paludinosus, aquatic insects, and mollusks. The proportion of fish prey in the diet was 60% by volume, irrespective of fish size. The differences in delta(15)N values of individuals within and between length classes were less than 3 per thousand, and were not significantly related to total length, showing the similarity in trophic niche of the different sizes, which corresponded to recorded stomach contents. Mercury concentrations were in the range of 0.002-0.154 mg kg(-1) ww, and had no significant relationship to total length. Hence, even large specimens of C. gariepinus have Hg values below the WHO threshold of 0.2 mg kg(-1) ww. The slope of the regression line between log [Hg] and delta(15)N was small, 0.06, indicating the absence of trophic shifts and biomagnification of Hg in larger specimens in our samples. The low Hg concentrations in C. gariepinus compared to the Hg concentrations in other piscivorous fish species in Lake Awassa, such as Barbus intermedius and B. paludinosus, may be due to its dependence on invertebrate preys at small size, diet switching towards low Hg prey fish at larger size, and growth biodilution owing to higher growth rate.",S0048-9697(07)00155-6 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2007.01.091 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed an 8-year record of stable isotope data on Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) from southern California to infer how the trophic position of this widespread invasive species changes over time as native ant species are displaced. We couple this longitudinal analysis with a biregional comparison of stable isotope data (delta(15)N) on ants from Argentina (native range) and California (introduced range) to quantify (i) how the trophic position of L. humile differs between native and introduced populations, and (ii) how relative trophic position as estimated by delta(15)N values of Argentine ants compare with those of other ants at the same site. Both long-term and biregional comparisons indicate that the Argentine ant's relative trophic position is reduced at sites with a longer history of occupation. Over the course of 8 years, the relative trophic position of L. humile remained high at the leading edge of an invasion front but declined, on average, behind the front as native ants disappeared. Relative to native populations, where L. humile is among the most carnivorous of ants, Argentine ants from California occupied lower trophic positions. These results support the hypothesis that Argentine ants shift their diet after establishment as a result of resource depletion and increasing reliance on plant-based resources, especially honeydew-producing Hemiptera.

"Shaner, Pei-Jen and Bowers, Michael and Macko, Stephen",2007,"Giving-updensity and dietary shifts in the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus.",Ecology,"Dietary shifts are commonly exhibited by omnivorous consumers when foraging from variable food resources. One advantage of dietary shifts for a consumer is the ability to gain complementary resources from different foods. In addition, dietary shifts often affect food-web dynamics. Despite the importance of dietary shifts to organismal, community, and ecosystem ecology, empirical studies of the ecological mechanisms that control dietary shifts are limited in scope. In this study, we tested the effects of complementary resources on dietary shifts of an omnivorous mammal, the white-footed mouse Peromyscus leucopus, in the context of depletable food patches in the natural environment. We used two complementary resources: seeds that provide a higher energy gain per unit handling time and mealworms that provide a higher protein gain per unit handling time. Stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen (delta13C, delta15N) in mouse plasma were used to quantify dietary shifts, and we determined giving-up density (GUD), the food density at which a forager leaves a food patch (for an optimal forager, it should correspond to the quitting harvest rate that balances net fitness gain with various costs of foraging). The results showed that GUD increased most significantly when a mixture of seeds and mealworms was added, compared to when only seeds or mealworms were added. This suggests that, given a similar level of food availability, a patch with a mixture of complementary foods is of higher quality than a patch with only one type of food. Moreover, GUD measured with seeds (GUDs) correlated positively with seed availability, and GUD measured with mealworms (GUDmw) correlated positively with mealworm availability, indicating that the marginal value of seeds or mealworms decreases with their relatively availability in the environment. As GUDs increased, P. leucopus shifted their diets toward higher trophic levels, and as GUDmw increased, P. leucopus shifted their diets toward lower trophic levels, suggesting dietary shifts driven by food complementarity. This study demonstrated that the combination of giving-up density and stable-isotope analysis holds great potential for testing ecological mechanisms underlying dietary shifts.",10.1890/0012-9658(2007)88[87:gdadsi]2.0.co;2 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These techniques can also be applied to fossil material when preservation of bone and other tissues is sufficient. Excavations of abandoned Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) colonies in Antarctica often provide well preserved remains of bone, feathers, and eggshell dating from hundreds to thousands of years B.P. Herein we present an approximately 38,000-year time series of delta13C and delta15N values of Adélie penguin eggshell from abandoned colonies located in three major regions of Antarctica. Results indicate an abrupt shift to lower-trophic prey in penguin diets within the past approximately 200 years. We posit that penguins only recently began to rely on krill as a major portion of their diet, in conjunction with the removal of baleen whales and krill-eating seals during the historic whaling era.

Using stable isotope analyses, we found assimilation of organic SDPOM to double community secondary production, and stoichiometric analyses revealed SDPOM enriched in phosphorus (P) to foster putatively fast-growing, P-rich consumers in the subsidized reach. This altered consumer-resource stoichiometry impacted both community structure and nutrient fluxes through the invertebrate community. Community structure shifted toward significantly reduced diversity and evenness in the subsidized reach and consequently toward shorter food chains.

These chemical tracers-stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen; persistent organic pollutant (POP) concentrations, patterns and ratios; and fatty acid profiles-were measured in blubber biopsy samples from North Pacific killer whales (Orcinus orca) (n=84) and were used to provide further insight into their diet, particularly for the offshore group, about which little dietary information is available. The offshore killer whales were shown to consume prey species that were distinctly different from those of sympatric resident and transient killer whales. In addition, it was confirmed that the offshores forage as far south as California. Thus, these results provide evidence that the offshores belong to a third killer whale ecotype. Resident killer whale populations showed a gradient in stable isotope profiles from west (central Aleutians) to east (Gulf of Alaska) that, in part, can be attributed to a shift from off-shelf to continental shelf-based prey. Finally, stable isotope ratio results, supported by field observations, showed that the diet in spring and summer of eastern Aleutian Island transient killer whales is apparently not composed exclusively of Steller sea lions.",S0141-1136(06)00165-6 [pii] and 10.1016/j.marenvres.2006.07.002 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditionally, delta13C vs. delta15N bi-plots have been used to describe food web structure for a single time period or ecosystem. Comparisons of food webs across time and space are increasing, but development of statistical approaches for testing hypotheses regarding food web change has lagged behind. Here we present statistical methodologies for quantitatively comparing stable isotope food web data. We demonstrate the utility of circular statistics and hypothesis tests for quantifying directional food web differences using two case studies: an arthropod salt marsh community across a habitat gradient and a freshwater fish community from Lake Tahoe, USA, over a 120-year time period. We calculated magnitude and mean angle of change (theta) for each species in food web space using mean delta13C and delta15N of each species as the x, y coordinates. In the coastal salt marsh, arthropod consumers exhibited a significant shift toward dependence on Spartina, progressing from a habitat invaded by Phragmites to a restored Spartina habitat. In Lake Tahoe, we found that all species from the freshwater fish community shifted in the same direction in food web space toward more pelagic-based production with the introduction of nonnative Mysis relicta and onset of cultural eutrophication. Using circular statistics to quantitatively analyze stable isotope food web data, we were able to gain significant insight into patterns and changes in food web structure that were not evident from qualitative comparisons. As more ecologists incorporate a food web perspective into ecosystem analysis, these statistical tools can provide a basis for quantifying directional food web differences from standard isotope data.",10.1890/07-0121.1 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Roth, James D and Marshall, John D and Murray, Dennis L and Nickerson, David M and Steury, Todd D",2007,Geographical gradients in diet affect population dynamics of Canada lynx.,Ecology,"Geographical gradients in the stability of cyclic populations of herbivores and their predators may relate to the degree of specialization of predators. However, such changes are usually associated with transition from specialist to generalist predator species, rather than from geographical variation in dietary breadth of specialist predators. Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) and snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) populations undergo cyclic fluctuations in northern parts of their range, but cycles are either greatly attenuated or lost altogether in the southern boreal forest where prey diversity is higher. We tested the influence of prey specialization on population cycles by measuring the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in lynx and their prey, estimating the contribution of hares to lynx diet across their range, and correlating this degree of specialization to the strength of their population cycles. Hares dominated the lynx diet across their range, but specialization on hares decreased in southern and western populations. The degree of specialization correlated with cyclic signal strength indicated by spectral analysis of lynx harvest data, but overall variability of lynx harvest (the standard deviation of natural-log-transformed harvest numbers) did not change significantly with dietary specialization. Thus, as alternative prey became more important in the lynx diet, the fluctuations became decoupled from a regular cycle but did not become less variable. Our results support the hypothesis that alternative prey decrease population cycle regularity but emphasize that such changes may be driven by dietary shifts among dominant specialist predators rather than exclusively through changes in the predator community.",10.1890/07-0147.1 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we explore the influence of trophic structure on total mercury (Hg) accumulation in red snapper (RS, Lutjanus campechanus) and gray snapper (GS, Lutjanus griseus) from the coastal Louisiana region of the Gulf of Mexico, west of the Mississippi River. The objectives of this investigation were to: (1) determine the effectiveness of the use of offshore recreational fishing charter boats and marinas as sources of fish samples and (2) compare species differences in Hg bioaccumulation, trophic position, and carbon sources. Our data show that length-normalized Hg concentrations (> or = 97% as MeHg in tissue of both species) were 230% greater in GS in comparison to RS collected from the same general area. Stable C and N isotope signatures (delta15N and delta13C) indicate that GS occupy a slightly higher trophic position (approximately 30% of one trophic position higher) on the Gulf food web in comparison to RS and that GS appear to incorporate higher trophic positioned prey, continually and at smaller sizes. Mercury was strongly correlated with combined delta15N and delta13C in pooled species data, arguing that most of the substantial difference in Hg bioaccumulation between RS and GS can be explained by modest differences in their trophic position and, to a lesser degree, carbon sources, which had low variation and high overlap among species. These observations demonstrate that even minor to moderate differences in trophic position and food habits in sympatric species can create relatively large differences in bioaccumulation regimes and underscores the importance of quantitative characterization of trophic structure in marine MeHg bioaccumulation studies.",10.1890/06-1422.1 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the detrital pathways in mangrove food webs in native (Puerto Rican) and introduced (Hawaiian) Rhizophora mangle forests using a dual isotope approach and a mixing model. Based on trophic-level fractionation of 0-1 per thousand for delta(13)C and 2-3 per thousand for delta(15)N, among the invertebrates, only nematodes, oligochaetes, and nereid polychaetes from native mangroves exhibited stable isotopes consistent with a mangrove-derived diet. Certain fauna, in particular tubificid oligochaetes, had delta(13)C values consistent with the consumption of mangrove leaves, but they were depleted in (15)N, suggesting their primary nitrogen source was low in (15)N, and was possibly N(2)-fixing bacteria. In introduced mangroves, all feeding groups appeared to rely heavily on non-mangrove sources, especially phytoplankton inputs. Mixing model results and discriminant analysis showed clear separation of introduced and native mangrove sites based on differential food source utilization within feeding groups, with stronger and more diverse use of benthic foods observed in native forests. Observed differences between native and invasive mangrove food webs may be due to Hawaiian detritivores being poorly adapted to utilizing the tannin-rich, nitrogen-poor mangrove detritus. In addition, differential utilization of mangrove detritus between native and introduced mangroves may be a consequence of forest age. We postulate that increasing mangrove forest age may promote diversification of bacterial food webs important in N and S cycling. Our results also suggest a potentially important role for sulfur bacteria in supporting the most abundant infaunal consumers, nematodes, in the most mature systems.",10.1007/s00442-007-0751-x [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assess the spatial and temporal distribution of Hg in the food web, young-of-the-year (YOY) spottail shiners (Notropis hudsonius) were collected in August 2005 from five sites along the Cornwall waterfront within a Hg-contaminated zone and two reference zones. The results were compared to analyses made between 1979 and 2000 by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment. Total Hg concentrations in spottail shiners from the contaminated zone were significantly higher than in reference zones, confirming previous observations. Within the contaminated zone, there were significant differences in Hg concentrations among three sites spaced about 500 m apart, consistent with a high degree of site fidelity of YOY fish and suggesting a possible internal source of Hg. Hg concentrations in spottail shiners are decreasing regionally, although year-to-year variability was high, particularly in the contaminated zone. Stable isotope analyses of spottail shiners did not reveal any differences in nitrogen isotope composition among zones that would indicate differences in food-web structure and Hg biomagnification. However, carbon sources at an upstream reference zone were not the same as within the Area of Concern. Differences in carbon isotope composition at two sites within the contaminated zone corresponded to differences in Hg concentrations, consistent with a unique internal source of Hg. The variation in Hg contamination of YOY spottail shiners over fine spatial and temporal scales provide important insights about the potential release of Hg from contaminated sediments and the role of climate in regional trends. Sessile YOY fish provide a precise indicator for demonstrating these differences and for assessing their cause.",10.1007/s00244-007-9040-2 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rats are opportunistic predators that are notorious for their impact on a variety of animal and plant species. However, little documented evidence on the complexities of these interactions is available.In our study, we assessed the impact of black rats Rattus rattus introduced on a small uninhabited island with a relatively simple ecosystem, Surprise Island, New Caledonia. We also compared the diet of R. rattus in the presence and absence of breeding seabirds, assessing the dietary compensation for this potentially important food source. From 2002 to 2005, we used live trapping studies combined with stable isotope analysis and conventional diet analyses (direct observations, gut and faecal contents) to characterize the diet of rats.Our results suggest a heavy predatory impact on seabirds, which could constitute as much as 24% of the rat diet. Moreover, in the absence of birds, rats compensated marginally by preying more heavily on other components of their diet but mostly acquired a new resource. They shifted their diet by preying heavily upon another endangered species, the hatchlings of sea turtles Chelonia mydas, which could constitute the main resource in the diet of R. rattus in those periods. Abundance, body condition and distribution of the rats were consistent with heavy predation upon this additional resource.Synthesis and applications. In island ecosystems invasive rats prey mainly upon seabird eggs and chicks, thereby threatening their populations. Although rats are certainly capable of surviving on terrestrial foods outside the seabird nesting season, their ability to prey upon ephemeral but abundant resources, such as hatchling sea turtles, may contribute to maintaining their populations. This may explain their success on Surprise Island, an ecosystem of extreme conditions, and suggests that biologists and managers working with threatened species should be aware of the possibility of temporary diet shifts by introduced rodents that may cause unexpected heavy predation on these species. This dietary shift from one endangered taxa to another has major implications for the conservation of seabirds and sea turtles world-wide and more generally for the biodiversity of invaded insular communities.",JPE1438 [pii] and 10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01438.x [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we investigate the principal sources of organic carbon supporting local shredder communities across a gradient in different levels of anthropogenic development along riverine reaches, in South Australia. In forested/wooded reaches with minimum to limited development, semi-emergent macrophytes were the principal sources of organic carbon supporting the local shredder communities. However, in developed reaches, course particulate organic matter and filamentous algae were the principal food sources. The C:N ratios of the food sources in developed reaches were higher than those of their consumers indicating a stoichiometric mismatch.

Threadfin shad competitively displaced other planktivorous fish in the lake, such as inland silversides, young-of-year (YOY) largemouth bass, and YOY bluegill, by reducing zooplankton abundance. As a result, all three species shifted from a diet that was dominated by zooplankton to one that was almost entirely zoobenthos. Stable carbon isotopes corroborated this pattern with each species becoming enriched in delta13C, which is elevated in benthic vs. pelagic organisms. Concomitant with these changes, Hg concentrations increased by approximately 50% in all three species. In contrast, obligate benthivores such as prickly sculpin showed no relationship between diet or delta13C and the presence of threadfin shad, suggesting that effects of the shad were not strongly linked to the benthic fish community. There were also no changes in Hg concentrations of prickly sculpin. The temporary extirpation of threadfin shad from the lake resulted in zooplankton densities, foraging patterns, isotope ratios, and Hg concentrations in pelagic fishes returning to pre-shad values.

We used the large-scale experimental framework of four marine reserves, spanning an oceanographic gradient in northeastern New Zealand, to test the extent to which the exploitation of reef predators can alter kelp carbon flux and secondary production. We provide evidence that the reduction of predatory snapper (Pagrus auratus) and lobster (Jasus edwardsii) can lead to an increase in sea urchins (Evechinus chloroticus) and indirect declines in kelp biomass in some locations but not others. Stable carbon isotope ratios (delta13C) of oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and mussels (Perna canaliculus) transplanted in reserve and fished sites within four locations revealed that fishing indirectly reduced the proportion of kelp-derived organic carbon assimilated by filter feeders in two locations where densities of actively grazing sea urchins were 23.7 and 8.3 times higher and kelp biomass was an order of magnitude lower than in non-fished reserve sites. In contrast, in the two locations where fishing had no effect on urchin density or kelp biomass, we detected no effect of fishing on the carbon signature of filter feeders. We show that the effects of fishing on nearshore trophic structure and carbon flux are context-dependent and hinge on large-scale, regional oceanographic factors. Where cascading effects of fishing on kelp biomass were documented, enhanced assimilation of kelp carbon did not result in the magnification of secondary production. Instead, a strong regional gradient in filter feeder growth emerged, best predicted by chlorophyll a. Estimates of kelp contribution to the diet of transplanted consumers averaged 56.9% +/- 6.2% (mean +/- SE) for mussels and 33.8% +/- 7.3% for oysters, suggesting that organic carbon fixed by kelp is an important food source fueling northeastern New Zealand's nearshore food webs. The importance of predators in mediating benthic primary production and organic carbon flux suggests that overfishing can have profound consequences on ecosystem functioning particularly where pelagic primary production is limiting. Our results underscore the broader ecosystem repercussions of overfishing and its context-dependent effects.",10.1890/07-1777.1 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diet analysis indicated that there were clear ontogenetic shifts in foraging habitats and trophic position. Pelagic diet decreased and benthic diet increased with increasing fish length in bluegill, black crappie, inland silverside, and largemouth bass, whereas there was no shift for prickly sculpin or threadfin shad. Stable carbon isotope values (delta13C) were inversely related to the proportion of pelagic prey items in the diet, but there was no clear relationship with benthic foraging. There were distinct differences between pelagic and benthic prey basal delta13C values, with a range of approximately -28 per thousand in pelagic zooplankton to approximately -20 per thousand in benthic caddisflies. Profundal prey such as chironomid larvae had intermediate delta13C values of approximately -24 per thousand, reflecting the influence of pelagic detrital subsidies and suppressing the propagation of the benthic carbon isotope signal up the food chain. Fish total mercury (TotHg) concentrations varied with habitat-specific foraging, trophic position, and size; however, the relationships differed among species and ages. When controlling for the effects of species, length, and trophic position, TotHg and delta13C were positively correlated, indicating that Hg trophic transfer is linked to benthic foraging. When examined on a species-specific basis, TotHg was positively correlated with delta13C only for bluegill, largemouth bass, and threadfin shad. However, diet-based multiple regression analyses suggested that TotHg also increased with benthic foraging for inland silverside and black crappie. In both species, benthic prey items were dominated by chironomid larvae, explaining the discrepancy with delta13C.

We investigated relationships between aquatic resource utilization and contaminant exposure for a riparian invertivore assemblage (spiders and herptiles) along a stream contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Stable carbon (delta13C) and nitrogen (delta15N) isotopes indicated that aquatic insect utilization varied among predators, with progressive enrichment of delta13C and depletion of delta15N as predators shifted from aquatic to terrestrial prey. PCB concentrations significantly increased along these isotopic gradients; delta13C and delta15N explained 65% and 15% of the variance in predator sigmaPCBs, respectively. PCBs in predators were high, exceeding 2000 ng/g wet mass (the human-health advisory prohibiting any consumption of fish tissue) in three species. Greater consideration should be given to streams as lateral exporters rather than simply as longitudinal conduits for contaminants. Persistent contaminants are underutilized for addressing landscape-level questions in subsidy research, but our results demonstrate they are an ideal in situ tracer of stream-derived energy because they label stream organic matter and invertebrates over large distances.

We found the trophic position of omnivorous crayfish to be positively correlated with lake trophic status, but found no evidence for any influence of lake size or productive space on crayfish trophic position. The higher trophic position of crayfish in eutrophic lakes was largely caused by a shift in crayfish diet and not by an increase in trophic links in basal parts of the food web. Hence, our results support the ""productivity hypothesis,"" suggesting that food chains can be longer in more productive systems. Furthermore, stable isotope data indicated that larger crayfish are more predatory than smaller crayfish in lakes with wider littoral zones. Wider littoral zones promoted the development of intrapopulation differences in trophic position whereas narrow littoral zones did not. Hence, differences in habitat quality between and within lakes seem to influence the trophic positions of omnivorous crayfish.",10.1007/s00442-008-1019-9 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although macroinvertebrate taxon body mass was negatively correlated with tissue metal concentration at several sites, it did not increase with trophic level (as delta15N) in any of the sites, suggesting that changes in body mass were not the cause of biodilution. Our findings suggest invertebrates at higher trophic levels may exhibit increasingly efficient excretion of metals. Autotrophic epilithon (mean delta13C= -21.3 per thousand) had a much higher concentration of mined metals than did riparian vegetation (mean delta13C= -29.3 per thousand); nonetheless, a carbon-mixing model indicated that taxa feeding on autochthonous carbon sources did not accumulate more metal than allochthonous feeders. It is likely that the notably high metal concentration of allochthonous FPOM plays an important role in the trophic transfer of metals. Our data suggest the strong potential for stable isotope analysis to enhance our understanding of metal transfer through stream macroinvertebrate food webs.",S0048-9697(08)00010-7 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.01.006 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Whitcraft, Christine R and Levin, Lisa A and Talley, Drew and Crooks, Jeffrey A",2008,Utilization of invasive tamarisk by salt marsh consumers.,Oecologia,"Plant invasions of coastal wetlands are rapidly changing the structure and function of these systems globally. Alteration of litter dynamics represents one of the fundamental impacts of an invasive plant on salt marsh ecosystems. Tamarisk species (Tamarix spp.), which extensively invade terrestrial and riparian habitats, have been demonstrated to enter food webs in these ecosystems. However, the trophic impacts of the relatively new invasion of tamarisk into marine ecosystem have not been assessed. We evaluated the trophic consequences of invasion by tamarisk for detrital food chains in the Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve salt marsh using litter dynamics techniques and stable isotope enrichment experiments. The observations of a short residence time for tamarisk combined with relatively low C:N values indicate that tamarisk is a relatively available and labile food source. With an isotopic (15N) enrichment of tamarisk, we demonstrated that numerous macroinvertebrate taxonomic and trophic groups, both within and on the sediment, utilized 15N derived from labeled tamarisk detritus. Infaunal invertebrate species that took up no or limited 15N from labeled tamarisk (A. californica, enchytraeid oligochaetes, coleoptera larvae) occurred in lower abundance in the tamarisk-invaded environment. In contrast, species that utilized significant 15N from the labeled tamarisk, such as psychodid insects, an exotic amphipod, and an oniscid isopod, either did not change or occurred in higher abundance. Our research supports the hypothesis that invasive species can alter the trophic structure of an environment through addition of detritus and can also potentially impact higher trophic levels by shifting dominance within the invertebrate community to species not widely consumed.",10.1007/s00442-008-1144-5 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Millions of people in the lake basin depend on several fish species for consumption. Due to the importance of fish consumption as an exposure route of mercury to humans, we sampled Lake Tanganyika in 2000 to assess total mercury concentrations and biomagnification of total mercury through the food web. Stable nitrogen and carbon isotope analyses of food web structure indicate a complex food web with overlapping omnivory with some specialist fish species. Stable nitrogen isotope analyses further confirm that mercury is biomagnifying through the Tanganyika food web at rates similar to those seen in Lakes Malawi and Victoria, the other two African Great Lakes. Most collected fish species and all invertebrate species had mercury concentrations below 0.2 microg Hg/g wet weight. However, several fish species, Ctenochromis horei (average 0.15 microg/g ww), Neolamprologus boulengeri (0.2 microg/g ww) , Bathybates spp.spp. (0.21 microg/g ww), Mastacembelus cunningtoni (0.22 microg/g ww) and Clarias theodorae (0.22 microg/g ww) approached or slightly exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO)'s recommended guideline of 0.2 microg Hg/g for vulnerable populations with high rates of fish consumption. Two individuals of the piscivorous fish species Lates microlepis (0.54, 0.78 microg/g ww) and a Polypterus congicus (1.3 microg/g ww) exceeded the international marketing limit value of 0.5 microg/g ww. Because C. theodorae and L. microlepis are also important market fish species, there is a need to monitor mercury concentrations in internationally marketed fish from Lake Tanganikya to ensure that those fish do not present a risk to human consumers.",S0048-9697(08)00450-6 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.04.017 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Effect of DDT on isotopic fractionation in Perca fluviatilis.,Chemosphere,"Nitrogen and carbon stable isotope analyses are frequently used to assess contaminant biomagnification in animals in the wild. Previous studies, mainly on plant but also on animal tissues, have shown that chemical stress can lead to shifts in delta(15)N. In order to assess if an exposure to DDT at realistic concentration disrupted stable isotope signature in animals, delta(15)N and delta(13)C were studied in several tissues (liver, muscle, gill) of Perca fluviatilis fed with the same commercial diet uncontaminated or contaminated with DDT. We observed no DDT effect on the delta(15)N and delta(13)C of fish tissues. Our results show that stable isotopes can remain useful for field ecotoxicological studies despite food-chain contamination.

Despite decades of research directed toward reducing N losses from agroecosystems, progress has been minimal, and the currently promoted best management practices are not necessarily the most effective. We investigated the fate of N additions to temperate grain agroecosystems using a meta-analysis of 217 field-scale studies that followed the stable isotope 15N in crops and soil. We compared management practices that alter inorganic fertilizer additions, such as application timing or reduced N fertilizer rates, to practices that re-couple the biogeochemical cycles of carbon (C) and N, such as organic N sources and diversified crop rotations, and analyzed the following response variables: 15N recovery in crops, total recovery of 15N in crops and soil, and crop yield. More of the literature (94%) emphasized crop recovery of 15N than total 15N recovery in crops and soil (58%), though total recovery is a more ecologically appropriate indicator for assessing N losses. Findings show wide differences in the ability of management practices to improve N use efficiency. Practices that aimed to increase crop uptake of commercial fertilizer had a lower impact on total 15N recovery (3-21% increase) than practices that re-coupled C and N cycling (30-42% increase). A majority of studies (66%) were only one growing season long, which poses a particular problem when organic N sources are used because crops recover N from these sources over several years. These short-term studies neglect significant ecological processes that occur over longer time scales. Field-scale mass balance calculations using the 15N data set show that, on average, 43 kg N x ha(-1) x yr(-1) was unaccounted for at the end of one growing season out of 114 kg N x ha(-1) x yr(-1), representing approximately 38% of the total 15N applied. This comprehensive assessment of stable-isotope research on agroecosystem N management can inform the development of policies to mitigate nonpoint source pollution. Nitrogen management practices that most effectively increase N retention are not currently being promoted and are rare on the landscape in the United States.",10.1890/08-1122.1 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gantner, Nikolaus and Hintelmann, Holger and Zheng, Wang and Muir, Derek C",2009,Variations in stable isotope fractionation of Hg in food webs of Arctic lakes.,Environmental science & technology,"Biotic and abiotic fractionation of mercury (Hg) isotopes has recently been shown to occur in aquatic environments. We determined isotope ratios (IRs) of Hg in food webs (zooplankton, chironomids, Arctic char) and sediments of 10 Arctic lakes from four regions and investigated the extent of Hg isotope fractionation. Hg IRs were analyzed by multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP/MS). Hg mass independent fractionation (MIF; Delta(199)Hg) and mass dependent fractionation (MDF; delta(202)Hg) were calculated and compared among samples. IRs of Hg in sediment were characterized mainly by MDF and low MIF (Delta(199)Hg -0.37 to 0.74 per thousand). However, all biota showed evidence of MIF, most pronounced in zooplankton (Delta(199)Hg up to 3.40 per thousand) and char (Delta(199)Hg up to 4.87 per thousand). Zooplankton takes up highly fractionated MeHg directly from the water column, while benthic organisms are exposed to sedimentary Hg, which contains less fractionated Hg. As evidenced by delta(13)C measurements, benthic chironomids make up a large proportion of char diet, explaining in part why MIF(char) < MIF(zooplankton) in lakes, where both samples were measured. Hg IRs in char varied among regions, while char from lakes from each region showed similar degrees of MIF. A MIF-offset was derived representing the mean MIF difference between sediment and fish, and indicated that fish in two regions retain sediment signatures altered by a consistent offset. Due to its minimal lake-to-catchment area and very high water retention time ( approximately 330 years), the meteor impact crater lake (Pingualuk) reflects a ""pure"" atmospheric Hg signature, which is modified only by aqueous in-lake processes. All other lakes are also affected by terrestrial Hg inputs and sediment processes.",10.1021/es901771r [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In marine systems, although large animals that return to land can be fitted with tracking devices, minimum instrument sizes preclude deployments on small seabirds that may nevertheless be highly abundant and hence major consumers. An increasingly popular approach is to use N and C stable isotope analysis of feathers sampled at colonies to provide information on distribution and trophic level for the preceding, and generally little-known, nonbreeding period. Despite the burgeoning of this research, there have been few attempts to verify such relationships. In this study, we demonstrate a clear correspondence between isotope ratios of feathers and nonbreeding distributions of seven species from South Georgia tracked using loggers. This generated a rudimentary isoscape that was used to infer the habitat preferences of eight other species ranging in size from storm petrels to albatrosses, and which could be applied, with caveats, in other studies. Differences in inferred distribution within and between species had major implications for relative exposure to anthropogenic threats, including climate change and fisheries. Although there were no differences in isotope values between sexes in any of the smaller petrels, mean stable C (delta(13)C), but not stable N isotope ratios (delta(15)N), tended to be greater in females than males of the larger, and more sexually size-dimorphic species. This indicates a difference in C source (distribution), rather than trophic level, and a correspondence between the degree of sexual size dimorphism in Procellariiformes and the level of between-sex niche segregation.",10.1007/s00442-009-1342-9 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stable isotopic signatures (i.e., 13C/12C, delta13C; 15N/14N, delta15N) in hair and two blood compartments (packed blood cells/clot and serum) were determined to assess the variation of Hg concentrations among polar bears in relation to their feeding ecology and other biological factors. Concentrations of Hg in hair and blood (2.2-23.9 microg/g dry wt and 0.007-0.213 microg/g wet wt, respectively) were within the range of values previously reported for polar bears in Canada and East Greenland. Mercury concentration in hair from females was higher than that in hair from males, and concentration was related to interactions between delta13C, delta15N, and longitude of capture location. Mercury concentrations in hair were inversely correlated to delta13C in hair and blood, suggesting that polar bears with greater total Hg concentrations fed more on pelagic prey, such as ringed seals or beluga whale, than on benthic prey. Variability in Hg concentrations in polar bear hair and blood may be the result of intraspecific or regional variation in prey selection rather than strictly trophic level interactions.",08-557 [pii] and 10.1897/08-557.1 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent discoveries have expanded the known ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotes from the domain Bacteria to Archaea. However, in the complex soil environment it remains unclear whether ammonia oxidation is exclusively or predominantly linked to Archaea as implied by their exceptionally high abundance. Here we show that Bacteria rather than Archaea functionally dominate ammonia oxidation in an agricultural soil, despite the fact that archaeal versus bacterial amoA genes are numerically more dominant. In soil microcosms, in which ammonia oxidation was stimulated by ammonium and inhibited by acetylene, activity change was paralleled by abundance change of bacterial but not of archaeal amoA gene copy numbers. Molecular fingerprinting of amoA genes also coupled ammonia oxidation activity with bacterial but not archaeal amoA gene patterns. DNA-stable isotope probing demonstrated CO(2) assimilation by Bacteria rather than Archaea. Our results indicate that Archaea were not important for ammonia oxidation in the agricultural soil tested.",EMI1891 [pii] and 10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.01891.x [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dietary reconstructions inferred from stable isotopes of fossil herbivorous mammalian tooth enamel document environmental and climatic changes in ancient ecosystems, including C(3)/C(4) transitions and relative seasonality. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we use stable carbon and oxygen isotopes preserved in fossil teeth to document the magnitude of mammalian dietary shifts and ancient floral change during geologically documented glacial and interglacial periods during the Pliocene (approximately 1.9 million years ago) and Pleistocene (approximately 1.3 million years ago) in Florida. Stable isotope data demonstrate increased aridity, increased C(4) grass consumption, inter-faunal dietary partitioning, increased isotopic niche breadth of mixed feeders, niche partitioning of phylogenetically similar taxa, and differences in relative seasonality with warming. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data show that global warming resulted in dramatic vegetation and dietary changes even at lower latitudes (approximately 28 degrees N). Our results also question the use of models that predict the long term decline and extinction of species based on the assumption that niches are conserved over time.

Polybrominated diphenyl ethers also were analyzed to provide a point of reference for comparison to previous studies. Concentrations of the dominant PBDE congeners (BDEs 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, and 154) increased significantly from 1979 until the mid-1990s, then either leveled off or decreased significantly between 1998 and 2004, a result that corresponds to those of previous studies.

The temporal trends of the non-PBDE flame retardants varied, with sum (sigma) HBCD and DP showing significant overall decreases; BTBPE, sigmaSCCP, and sigmaMCCP showing parabolic trends; and PEB showing no overall change during the study period. Because many of the non-PBDE chemicals may be used as replacements for penta- and octa-BDE mixtures, these results will provide a baseline to evaluate future usage patterns. Possible changes in food-web structure, evaluated through stable nitrogen isotopes (delta15N), may be influencing our interpretations of contaminant trends in lake trout and are hypothesized to be partially responsible for the observed decrease in concentrations of BDEs 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, and 154 between 1998 and 2004.

Higher concentrations of PCBs occurred in decapods and fish than in mollusks. In contrast, concentrations of PAHs and alkylphenols were lower in decapods and fish than in mollusks. Unlike PCBs, whose concentrations largely increased with increasing delta(15)N (i.e. increasing trophic level), all PAHs and alkylphenols analyzed followed a reverse trend. Molecular weights of PAHs are lower than those of PCBs, therefore low membrane permeability caused by large molecular size is an unlikely factor in the ""biodilution"" of PAHs.

Ecologically and physiologically meaningful biochemical tracers provide a means to characterize and quantify these transfers within food webs. In this study, changes in the ratios of stable N isotopes (e.g., delta(15)N), fatty acids (FA), and persistent contaminants were used to trace food web pathways utilized by herring gulls (Larus argentatus) breeding along the shores of the St Lawrence River, Canada. Egg delta(15)N values varied significantly among years and were used as an indicator of gull trophic position. Temporal trends in egg delta(15)N values were related to egg FA profiles. In years when egg delta(15)N values were greater, egg FA patterns reflected the consumption of more aquatic prey. Egg delta(15)N values were also correlated with annual estimates of prey fish abundance. These results indicated that temporal changes in aquatic prey availability were reflected in the gull diet (as inferred from ecological tracer profiles in gull eggs). Analysis of individual eggs within years confirmed that birds consuming more aquatic prey occupied higher trophic positions. Furthermore, increases in trophic position were associated with increased concentrations of most persistent organic contaminants in eggs. However, levels of highly brominated polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners, e.g, 2,2',3,3',4,4',5,5',6,6'-decabromoDE (BDE-209), showed a negative relationship with trophic position. These contrasting findings reflected differences among contaminant groups/homologs in terms of their predominant routes of transfer, i.e., aquatic versus terrestrial food webs. High trophic level omnivores, e.g., herring gulls, are common in food webs.

We provide a 6-year history of elephant diet by examining tail hair collected from 4 elephants in the same social family unit in northern Kenya. Sequential measurements of carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen isotope rations in hair provide a weekly record of diet and water resources. Carbon isotope ratios were well correlated with satellite-based measurements of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of the region occupied by the elephants as recorded by the global positioning system (GPS) movement record; the absolute amount of C(4) grass consumption is well correlated with the maximum value of NDVI during individual wet seasons. Changes in hydrogen isotope ratios coincided very closely in time with seasonal fluctuations in rainfall and NDVI whereas diet shifts to relatively high proportions of grass lagged seasonal increases in NDVI by approximately 2 weeks. The peak probability of conception in the population occurred approximately 3 weeks after peak grazing. Spatial and temporal patterns of resource use show that the only period of pure browsing by the focal elephants was located in an over-grazed, communally managed region outside the protected area.

In general, free range and organic egg components showed enrichment of (15)N values up to 4‰ relative to caged and barn laid eggs, suggesting a higher animal protein (trophic) contribution to the chicken's diet than pure plant-based foods and/or that the feed was organically manufactured. One sample of free range and two samples of organic eggs had δ(15)N values within the range of caged or barn laid eggs, suggesting either that these eggs were mislabeled (the hens were raised under ""battery"" or ""barn"" conditions, and not permitted to forage outside) or that there was insufficient animal protein gained by foraging to shift the δ(15)N values of their primary food source. δ(13)C values of potential food sources are discussed with respect to dietary intake and contribution to the isotopic signature of the eggs to determine mixing of C(3) and C(4) diets, although they did not elucidate laying regimen.

Adding organic residues to agricultural systems may therefore enhance pest control. We investigated whether resource addition (maize mulch) strengthens aboveground trophic cascades in winter wheat fields. Evaluating the flux of the maize-borne carbon into the food web after 9 months via stable isotope analysis allowed differentiating between prey in predator diets originating from the above- and belowground subsystems. Furthermore, we recorded aphid populations in predator-reduced and control plots of no-mulch and mulch addition treatments. All analyzed soil dwelling species incorporated maize-borne carbon. In contrast, only 2 out of 13 aboveground predator species incorporated maize carbon, suggesting that these 2 predators forage on prey from the above- and belowground systems. Supporting this conclusion, densities of these two predator species were increased in the mulch addition fields. Nitrogen isotope signatures suggested that these generalist predators in part fed on Collembola thereby benefiting indirectly from detrital resources. Increased density of these two predator species was associated by increased aphid control but the identity of predators responsible for aphid control varied in space. One of the three wheat fields studied even lacked aphid control despite of mulch-mediated increased density of generalist predators. The results suggest that detrital subsidies quickly enter belowground food webs but only a few aboveground predator species include prey out of the decomposer system into their diet. Variation in the identity of predator species benefiting from detrital resources between sites suggest that, depending on locality, different predator species are subsidised by prey out of the decomposer system and that these predators contribute to aphid control. Therefore, by engineering the decomposer subsystem via detrital subsidies, biological control by generalist predators may be strengthened.",1604 [pii] and 10.1007/s00442-010-1604-6 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our data indicate a significant dietary shift between fish and krill, with a gradual decrease from past to present time in the proportion of fish compared to krill in Adélie penguin diet. From 7,200 to 2,000 years BP, δ(13)C and δ(15)N values indicate fish as the most eaten prey. The dietary contribution of lower-trophic prey in penguin diet started becoming evident not earlier than 2,000 years BP, when the δ(13)C values reveal a change in the penguin feeding behavior. Modern eggshell and guano samples reveal a major dietary contribution of krill but not a krill-dominated diet, since δ(13)C values remain much too high if krill prevail in the diet. According to the Holocene environmental background attested for Victoria Land, Adélie penguin dietary shifts between fish and krill seem to reflect penguin paleoecological responses to different paleoenvironmental settings with different conditions of sea-ice extension and persistence. Furthermore, Adélie penguin diet appears to be particularly affected by environmental changes in a very specific period within the breeding season, namely the egg-laying period when penguin dietary and feeding habit shifts are clearly documented by the δ(13)C of eggshell carbonate.",10.1007/s00442-010-1790-2 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The importance of these flatfish as a human dietary resource indicates they are potential sources of mercury (Hg) to fish-consuming citizens. In this study, summer flounder (SF) and winter flounder (WF) were collected from the Narragansett Bay (Rhode Island, USA) and were measured for total Hg burden in whole-body or dorsal muscle tissue. Interspecies differences in Hg contamination were analyzed relative to flounder body size, age, and Hg content of preferred prey. Stable isotope signatures were also used to elucidate the effect of trophic processes on Hg accumulation in the estuarine food web. The mean Hg content of SF exceeded concentrations measured in WF across multiple life-history stages (0.039-0.100 and 0.016-0.029 mg Hg/kg wet weight for SF and WF, respectively), and observed values for both species were lower than the US Environmental Protection Agency regulatory threshold of 0.3 mg Hg/kg wet weight. Total Hg concentrations were also positively correlated with flounder age and length, verifying that both flatfish bioaccumulate Hg. SF accumulate Hg at an accelerated rate, however, owing to this species consuming Hg-enriched prey (teleosts, squid, and macrocrustaceans; mean Hg content = 0.023 mg Hg/kg wet weight), whereas WF feed on prey with low Hg levels (amphipods and polychaetes; mean Hg content = 0.013 mg Hg/kg wet weight). The positive correlation observed between mean biota Hg content and stable nitrogen (delta(15)N) isotope signatures further indicates that Hg is trophically transferred through the food web, and higher trophic level organisms (i.e., enriched delta(15)N) have increased Hg concentrations. Therefore, results from this study suggest that dietary preference and trophic structure are the main factors affecting Hg bioaccumulation in the estuary. Total Hg concentrations of flatfish from the Narragansett Bay, however, do not necessarily reflect coastwide contamination patterns. This reinforces the importance of having research conducted at sufficiently small spatial scales, including the local assessment of Hg contamination for the purpose of issuing state consumption advisories.",10.1007/s00244-009-9423-7 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In both species, changes in delta(13)C (C. cinclus) or delta(15)N (C. mexicanus) in female plasma relative to red blood cells indicated a dietary shift during laying that was not observed in males. Eurasian dippers increased prey consumption as breeding approached, shifting from primarily trichopteran insect larvae to ephemeropterans and plecopterans. In American dippers, egg-laying females switched to feeding at a higher trophic level by consuming more fish. Eggs derived from higher trophic level diets contained more mercury (American dipper), polychlorinated biphenyls and some organochlorines, especially DDT metabolites.

Both diet and isotope results indicated that the S. alpinus population relied mainly on littoral benthic energy sources. The strong littoral reliance appeared largely independent of season or fish size, although the data lacked small (total length, L(T), <130 mm) and young (<3 years) S. alpinus. Liver isotope values of intermediate-sized S. alpinus (200-350 mm), however, suggested exploitation of the increase in the abundance of pelagic zooplankton in the late open-water season. The results suggest that, in general, a strong littoral reliance of fishes can be a feature in subarctic lakes throughout the year. Due to its faster isotopic turnover rate and thus higher resolution for temporal diet changes, liver could be more commonly used in stable-isotope studies of fish trophic niche shifts instead of using only the less responsive muscle tissue.",JFB2656 [pii] and 10.1111/j.1095-8649.2010.02656.x [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased photosynthetic activity is expected, especially for C-3 plants, thereby influencing vegetation dynamics; however, little is known about the path of fixed carbon into soil-borne communities and resulting feedbacks on ecosystem function. Here, we examine how arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) act as a major conduit in the transfer of carbon between plants and soil and how elevated atmospheric CO(2) modulates the belowground translocation pathway of plant-fixed carbon. Shifts in active AMF species under elevated atmospheric CO(2) conditions are coupled to changes within active rhizosphere bacterial and fungal communities. Thus, as opposed to simply increasing the activity of soil-borne microbes through enhanced rhizodeposition, elevated atmospheric CO(2) clearly evokes the emergence of distinct opportunistic plant-associated microbial communities. Analyses involving RNA-based stable isotope probing, neutral/phosphate lipid fatty acids stable isotope probing, community fingerprinting, and real-time PCR allowed us to trace plant-fixed carbon to the affected soil-borne microorganisms. Based on our data, we present a conceptual model in which plant-assimilated carbon is rapidly transferred to AMF, followed by a slower release from AMF to the bacterial and fungal populations well-adapted to the prevailing (myco-)rhizosphere conditions. This model provides a general framework for reappraising carbon-flow paths in soils, facilitating predictions of future interactions between rising atmospheric CO(2) concentrations and terrestrial ecosystems.",0912421107 [pii] and 200912421 [pii] and 10.1073/pnas.0912421107 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present the first dietary and environmental reconstructions in Northeastern Thailand, using stable isotope abundances in mammalian tooth enamel from the late Middle Pleistocene locality, Tham Wiman Nakin (Snake Cave), which reflect a much higher (over 70%) than modern (13%) occurrence of C4 plants. Bovids and cervids appear to have had almost entirely a C4 plant diet. Carnivores consumed a mixture of C3 (suids) and C4 (bovids, cervids) consumers. Rhinoceroses and orangutan appear to have maintained their preference through time for forested or open C3 environment, respectively. (13)C/(12)C from bone bioapatite, horn and hair of modern Southeast Asian mammals almost exclusively demonstrate C3 vegetation dominance. C4 consumption is rare in analysed modern species and it could be related to anthropogenic influences such as ingestion of domestic crops or livestock. Interesting implications emerge in the C4 vegetation distribution in southern Eurasian ecosystems, indicating that Southeast Asia, south of the Tibet, could be part of the global C4 vegetation spread, which occurred around 7 Ma. However, the C4 percentage in ecosystems varied geographically. Despite modern reversal towards C3 habitats due to factors such as increasing CO(2), we think that anthropological influences may be responsible for habitat and dietary changes in extant species. Bovids demonstrate the most significant shift in diet and habitat through time, from C4-dominated open habitats to C3-dominated habitats indicative of dense forest understory.",10.1007/s00114-009-0642-6 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jin, Virginia L and Evans, R D",2010,Elevated CO2 increases plant uptake of organic and inorganic N in the desert shrub Larrea tridentata.,Oecologia,"Resource limitations, such as the availability of soil nitrogen (N), are expected to constrain continued increases in plant productivity under elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO(2)). One potential but under-studied N source for supporting increased plant growth under elevated CO(2) is soil organic N. In arid ecosystems, there have been no studies examining plant organic N uptake to date. To assess the potential effects of elevated atmospheric CO(2) on plant N uptake dynamics, we quantified plant uptake of organic and inorganic N forms in the dominant desert shrub Larrea tridentata under controlled environmental conditions. Seedlings of L. tridentata were grown in the Mojave Desert (NV, USA) soils that had been continuously exposed to ambient or elevated atmospheric CO(2) for 8 years at the Nevada Desert FACE Facility. After 6 months of growth in environmentally controlled chambers under ambient (380 micromol mol(-1)) or elevated (600 micromol mol(-1)) CO(2), pots were injected with stable isotopically labeled sole-N sources ((13)C-[2]-(15)N glycine, (15)NH(4) (+), or (15)NO(3) (-)) and moved back to their respective chambers for the remainder of the study. Plants were destructively harvested at 0, 2, 10, 24, and 49 days. Plant uptake of soil N derived from glycine, NH(4) (+), and NO(3) (-) increased under elevated CO(2) at days 2 and 10. Further, root uptake of organic N as glycine occurred as intact amino acid within the first hour after N treatment, indicated by approximately 1:1 M enrichment ratios of (13)C:(15)N. Plant N uptake responses to elevated CO(2) are often species-specific and could potentially shift competitive interactions between co-occurring species. Thus, physiological changes in root N uptake dynamics coupled with previously observed changes in the availability of soil N resources could impact plant community structure as well as ecosystem nutrient cycling under increasing atmospheric CO(2) levels in the Mojave Desert.",10.1007/s00442-010-1562-z [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ecological data spanning centuries to millennia provide important contextual information for long-term management strategies, especially for species that now are living in relict populations. Here we use a variety of methods to reconstruct bald eagle diets and local abundance of their potential prey on the Channel Islands from the late Pleistocene to the time when the last breeding pairs disappeared from the islands in the mid-20th century. Faunal and isotopic analysis of bald eagles shows that seabirds were important prey for immature/adult eagles for millennia before the eagles' local extirpation. In historic times (A.D. 1850-1950), however, isotopic and faunal data show that breeding bald eagles provisioned their chicks with introduced ungulates (e.g., sheep), which were locally present in high densities. Today, bald eagles are the focus of an extensive conservation program designed to restore a stable breeding population to the Channel Islands, but native and nonnative prey sources that were important for bald eagles in the past are either diminished (e.g., seabirds) or have been eradicated (e.g., introduced ungulates). In the absence of sufficient resources, a growing bald eagle population on the Channel Islands could expand its prey base to include carrion from local pinniped colonies, exert predation pressure on a recovering seabird population, and possibly prey on endangered island foxes.",0913011107 [pii] and 200913011 [pii] and 10.1073/pnas.0913011107 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that community structure and trophic position of oribatid mites of dry grassland soils and bark of trees are similar since these habitats have similar abiotic characteristics (open, dry) compared with forest soil. Further, we hypothesized that derived taxa of oribatid mites reproducing sexually dominate on the bark of trees since species in this habitat consume living resources such as lichens. In contrast to our hypothesis, the community structure of oribatid mites differed among grassland, forest and bark indicating the existence of niche differentiation in the respective oribatid mite species. In agreement with our hypothesis, sexually reproducing taxa of oribatid mites dominated on the bark of trees whereas parthenogenetic species were more frequent in soil. Several species of bark-living oribatid mites had stable isotope signatures that were similar to lichens indicating that they feed on lichens. However, nine species that frequently occurred on tree bark did not feed on lichens according to their stable isotope signatures. No oribatid mite species could be ascribed to moss feeding. We conclude that sexual reproduction served as preadaptation for oribatid mites allowing them to exploit new habitats and new resources on the bark of trees. Abiotic factors likely are of limited importance for bark-living oribatid mites since harsh abiotic conditions are assumed to favor parthenogenesis.",9366 [pii] and 10.1007/s10493-010-9366-8 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using results from laboratory diet manipulations and monthly sampling of field populations, we illustrate how nitrogen isotopes may be used to quantify spatio-temporal variation in resource assimilation in ants. First, we determined nitrogen enrichment using a controlled laboratory experiment with the invasive Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). After 12 weeks, worker δ(15)N values from colonies fed an animal-based diet had δ(15)N values that were 5.51% greater compared to colonies fed a plant-based diet. The shift in δ(15)N values in response to the experimental diet occurred within 10 weeks. We next reared Argentine ant colonies with or without access to honeydew-producing aphids and found that after 8 weeks workers from colonies without access to aphids had δ(15)N values that were 6.31% larger compared to colonies with access to honeydew. Second, we sampled field populations over a 1-year period to quantify spatio-temporal variability in isotopic ratios of L. humile and those of a common native ant (Solenopsis xyloni). Samples from free-living colonies revealed that fluctuations in δ(15)N were 1.6-2.4‰ for L. humile and 1.8-2.9‰ for S. xyloni. Variation was also detected among L. humile castes: time averaged means of δ(15)N varied from 1.2 to 2.5‰ depending on the site, with δ(15)N values for queens ≥ workers > brood. The estimated trophic positions of L. humile and S. xyloni were similar within a site; however, trophic position for each species differed significantly at larger spatial scales. While stable isotopes are clearly useful for examining the trophic ecology of arthropod communities, our results suggest that caution is warranted when making ecological interpretations when stable isotope collections come from single time periods or life stages.",1694 [pii] and 10.1007/s00442-010-1694-1 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Especially in anaerobic habitats, a large diversity of unrecognized microbial populations may be responsible for their degradation. Still, our present understanding of the respective microbiota and their ecophysiology is almost exclusively based on a small number of cultured organisms, mostly within the Proteobacteria. Here, by DNA-based stable isotope probing (SIP), we directly identified the most active sulfate-reducing toluene degraders in a diverse sedimentary microbial community originating from a tar-oil-contaminated aquifer at a former coal gasification plant. On incubation of fresh sediments with (13)C(7)-toluene, the production of both sulfide and (13)CO(2) was clearly coupled to the (13)C-labeling of DNA of microbes related to Desulfosporosinus spp. within the Peptococcaceae (Clostridia). The screening of labeled DNA fractions also suggested a novel benzylsuccinate synthase alpha-subunit (bssA) sequence type previously only detected in the environment to be tentatively affiliated with these degraders. However, carbon flow from the contaminant into degrader DNA was only ∼50%, pointing toward high ratios of heterotrophic CO(2)-fixation during assimilation of acetyl-CoA originating from the contaminant by these degraders. These findings demonstrate that the importance of non-proteobacterial populations in anaerobic aromatics degradation, as well as their specific ecophysiology in the subsurface may still be largely ungrasped.",ismej201054 [pii] and 10.1038/ismej.2010.54 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stable isotopic ratios of carbon ((13)C/(12)C) and nitrogen ((15)N/(14)N) were determined as well to provide insights into diet variations between regions or through time. Mercury concentrations decreased the first years of life of the animals suggesting that Hg had been transferred from the mother to the foetus and newborn. The Hg concentrations in teeth were significantly lesser in ringed seals from central West Greenland compared to those from central East Greenland. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopic values measured in the animals differed also significantly between the two regions. Increasing temporal trends of dental Hg concentrations between 1994 and 2006 were observed in ringed seals from both central West Greenland and central East Greenland. These increases were attributed to global changes in environmental Hg levels since no temporal trends in delta(15)N values were found to support the hypothesis of a diet shift over time. Furthermore, a decreasing temporal trend in delta(13)C values was observed in the teeth of seals from central East Greenland, and explained by a likely change over time towards more pelagic feeding habits; alternatively, the so-known Seuss effect was thought to be responsible for this decrease.

The aim of this study was to relate the transfer of total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) in a Gulf of St. Lawrence food web to the trophic structure, from primary consumers to seabirds, using stable nitrogen (δ(15)N) and carbon (δ(13)C) isotope analysis and physical environmental parameters. The energy reaching upper trophic level species was principally derived from pelagic primary production, with particulate organic matter (POM) at the base of the food chain. We developed a biomagnification factor (BMF) taking into account the various prey items consumed by a given predator using stable isotope mixing models. This BMF provides a more realistic estimation than when using a single prey. Lipid content, body weight, trophic level and benthic connection explained 77.4 and 80.7% of the variation in THg and MeHg concentrations, respectively in this food web. When other values were held constant, relationships with lipid and benthic connection were negative whereas relationships with trophic level and body weight were positive. Total Hg and MeHg biomagnified in this food web with biomagnification power values (slope of the relationship with δ(15)N) of 0.170 and 0.235, respectively on wet weight and 0.134 and 0.201, respectively on dry weight. Values of biomagnification power were greater for pelagic and benthopelagic species compared to benthic species whereas the opposite trend was observed for levels at the base of the food chain. This suggests that Hg would be readily bioavailable to organisms at the base of the benthic food chain, but trophic transfer would be more efficient in each trophic level of pelagic and benthopelagic food chains.",S0048-9697(10)00747-3 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.07.053 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In South America, the presence of well-developed Prosopis flexuosa woodlands in the Monte Desert region east of the Andes has puzzled scientists for decades. Today these woodlands provide crucial subsistence to local populations, including descendants of the indigenous Huarpes. We explore the vulnerability and importance of phreatic groundwater for the productivity of the region, comparing the contributions of local rainfall to that of remote mountain recharge that is increasingly being diverted for irrigated agriculture before it reaches the desert. We combined deep soil coring, plant measurements, direct water-table observations, and stable-isotopic analyses (2H and 18O) of meteoric, surface, and ground waters at three study sites across the region, comparing woodland stands, bare dunes, and surrounding shrublands. The isotopic composition of phreatic groundwaters (delta2H: -137 per thousand +/- 5 per thousand) closely matched the signature of water brought to the region by the Mendoza River (-137 per thousand +/- 6 per thousand), suggestin that mountain-river infiltration rather than in situ rainfall deep drainage (-39 per thousand +/- 19 per thousand) was the dominant mechanism of recharge. Similarly, chloride mass balances determined from deep soil profiles (> 6 m) suggested very low recharge rates. Vegetation in woodland ecosystems, where significant groundwater discharge losses, likely >100 mm/yr occurred, relied on regionally derived groundwater located from 6.5 to 9.5 m underground. At these locations, daily water-table fluctuations of 10 mm, and stable-isotopic measurements of plant water, indicated groundwater uptake rates of 200-300 mm/yr. Regional scaling suggests that groundwater evapotranspiration reaches 18-42 mm/yr across the landscape, accounting for 7 17% of the Mendoza River flow regionally. Our study highlights the reliance of ecosystem productivity in natural oases on Andean snowmelt, which is increasingly being diverted to one of the largest irrigated regions of the continent.

To investigate SRB involvement in methylation in Amazonian periphyton, the relationship between Hg methylation potential and SRB (Desulfobacteraceae, Desulfobulbaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae) abundance in Eichhornia crassipes and Polygonum densiflorum root associated periphyton was examined. Periphyton subsamples of each macrophyte were amended with electron donors (lactate, acetate and propionate) or inhibitors (molybdate) of sulfate reduction to create differences in SRB subgroup abundance, which was measured by quantitative real-time PCR with primers specific for the 16S rRNA gene. Mercury methylation and demethylation potentials were determined by a stable isotope tracer technique using 200HgCl and CH3(202)HgCl, respectively. Relative abundance of Desulfobacteraceae (<0.01-12.5%) and Desulfovibrionaceae (0.01-6.8%) were both highly variable among samples and subsamples, but a significant linear relationship (p<0.05) was found between Desulfobacteraceae abundance and net methylmercury formation among treatments of the same macrophyte periphyton and among all P. densiflorum samples, suggesting that Desulfobacteraceae bacteria are the most important mercury methylators among SRB families. Yet, molybdate only partially inhibited mercury methylation potentials, suggesting the involvement of other microorganisms as well.

"Gibb, Heloise and Cunningham, Saul A",2011,Habitat contrasts reveal a shift in the trophic position of ant assemblages.,The Journal of animal ecology,"1. Trophic structure within a guild can be influenced by factors such as resource availability and competition. While ants occupy a wide range of positions in food webs, and ant community composition changes with habitat, it is not well understood if ant genera tend to maintain their position in the trophic structure, or if trophic position varies across habitats. 2. We used ratios of stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen to test for differences in the trophic structure and position of assemblages of ants among habitat types. We tested for differences between assemblages in replicate sites of the land use categories: (i) pastures with old large trees; (ii) recently revegetated pastures with small young trees; and (iii) remnant woodlands. Known insect herbivores and predatory spiders provided baselines for herbivorous and predaceous arthropods. Soil samples were used to correct for the base level of isotopic enrichment at each site. 3. We found no significant interactions between land use and ant genus for isotope enrichment, indicating that trophic structure is conserved across land use categories. The fixed relative positions of genera in the trophic structure might be re-enforced by competition or some other factor. However, the entire ant assemblage had significantly lower δ(15) N values in revegetated sites, suggesting that ants feed lower down in the food chain i.e. they are more 'herbivorous' in revegetated sites. This may be a result of the high availability of plant sugars, honeydew and herbivorous arthropod prey. 4. Surprisingly, ants in remnants and pastures with trees displayed similar isotopic compositions. Interactions within ant assemblages are thus likely to be resilient to changes in land use, but ant diets in early successional habitats may reflect the simplicity of communities, which may have comparatively lower rates of saprophagy and predation.",10.1111/j.1365-2656.2010.01747.x [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gibson, Luke",2011,Possible shift in macaque trophic level following a century of biodiversity loss in Singapore.,Primates; journal of primatology,"Biodiversity loss in tropical forests is a major problem in conservation biology, and nowhere is this more dire than in Southeast Asia. Deforestation and the associated loss of species may trigger shifts in habitat and feeding preferences of persisting species. In this study, I compared the habitat use and diet of long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis) populations in Singapore from two time periods: museum specimens originally collected between 1893 and 1944, and living macaques sampled in 2009. I collected hair and used stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis to identify temporal changes in dietary source and trophic position, respectively. δ(13)C ratios were virtually identical, suggesting that macaques foraged in similar habitats during both time periods. However, δ(15)N ratios decreased considerably over time, suggesting that macaques today feed at a lower trophic level than previously. This decline in trophic level may be because of the disappearance or decline of other species that compete with macaques for fruit. This study highlights the effect of biodiversity loss on persisting species in degraded habitats of Southeast Asia, and improves our understanding of how species will adapt to further human-driven changes in tropical forest habitats.",10.1007/s10329-011-0251-9 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bluefish Hg concentrations were analyzed relative to fish length, prey Hg content, and ontogenetic shifts in habitat use and foraging ecology, the latter assessed using stomach content analysis (n = 711) and stable nitrogen (δ(15)N) and carbon (δ(13)C) isotope measurements (n = 360). Diet and δ(13)C analysis showed that age 0 bluefish consumed both benthic and pelagic prey (silversides, sand shrimp, planktonic crustaceans; δ(13)C = - 16.52‰), whereas age 1 + bluefish fed almost exclusively on pelagic forage fish (Atlantic menhaden, herring; δ(13)C = - 17.33‰). Bluefish total Hg concentrations were significantly correlated with length (mean Hg = 0.041 and 0.254 ppm wet wt for age 0 and age 1 + bluefish, respectively). Furthermore, Hg biomagnification rates were maximal during bluefish early life stages and decelerated over time, resulting in relatively high Hg concentrations in age 0 fish. Rapid Hg accumulation in age 0 bluefish is attributed to these individuals occupying a comparable trophic level to age 1 + bluefish (δ(15)N = 15.58 and 16.09‰; trophic level = 3.55 and 3.71 for age 0 and age 1 + bluefish, respectively), as well as juveniles having greater standardized consumption rates of Hg-contaminated prey. Finally, bluefish larger than 30 cm total length consistently had Hg levels above the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency criterion of 0.3 ppm. As such, frequent consumption of bluefish could pose a human health risk, and preferentially consuming smaller bluefish may be an inadequate strategy for minimizing human dietary exposure to Hg.",10.1002/etc.516 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the consequences of such habitat shifts in terms of changes in exposure to contaminants are poorly understood. We evaluated the exposure of the waterbird community breeding at the saltworks of Thyna (Tunisia) to total Hg (THg) and Se according to their differential use of saltworks dietary resources, as revealed by δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N values in their eggs (included species [n] -sorted according to increasing reliance on saltworks resources: Yellow-legged Gull Larus michahellis [12], Common Tern Sterna hirundo [12], Slender-billed Gull Larus genei [15], Little Egret Egretta garzetta [20], and Pied Avocet Recurvirostra avosetta [22]). Concentrations of THg and Se were under the threshold points for deleterious effects. Egg THg concentrations significantly decreased as the dietary contribution of saltworks resources increased (mean: 3.23, 1.66, 0.76, 0.4, and 0.27 μg/g dw, respectively). Conversely, egg Se concentrations did not vary according to foraging habitats (2.49, 2.96, 2.61, 3.27, and 1.5 μg/g dw, respectively).

"Shaner, Pei-Jen L and Macko, Stephen A",2011,Trophic shifts of a generalist consumer in response to resource pulses.,PloS one,"Trophic shifts of generalist consumers can have broad food-web and biodiversity consequences through altered trophic flows and vertical diversity. Previous studies have used trophic shifts as indicators of food-web responses to perturbations, such as species invasion, and spatial or temporal subsidies. Resource pulses, as a form of temporal subsidies, have been found to be quite common among various ecosystems, affecting organisms at multiple trophic levels. Although diet switching of generalist consumers in response to resource pulses is well documented, few studies have examined if the switch involves trophic shifts, and if so, the directions and magnitudes of the shifts. In this study, we used stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes with a Bayesian multi-source mixing model to estimate proportional contributions of three trophic groups (i.e. producer, consumer, and fungus-detritivore) to the diets of the White-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) receiving an artificial seed pulse or a naturally-occurring cicadas pulse. Our results demonstrated that resource pulses can drive trophic shifts in the mice. Specifically, the producer contribution to the mouse diets was increased by 32% with the seed pulse at both sites examined. The consumer contribution to the mouse diets was also increased by 29% with the cicadas pulse in one of the two grids examined. However, the pattern was reversed in the second grid, with a 13% decrease in the consumer contribution with the cicadas pulse. These findings suggest that generalist consumers may play different functional roles in food webs under perturbations of resource pulses. This study provides one of the few highly quantitative descriptions on dietary and trophic shifts of a key consumer in forest food webs, which may help future studies to form specific predictions on changes in trophic interactions following resource pulses.",PONE-D-10-04205 [pii] and 10.1371/journal.pone.0017970 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Total mercury (THg in mg kg(-1), ww) concentrations were low, with mean values of 0.033, 0.034, 0.025, and 0.011, in C. gariepinus, T. zillii, C. auratus, and O. niloticus, respectively. The relationships between mercury concentrations against total length (TL) and total weight (TW) were positive and significant in T. zillii, C. auratus, and C. gariepinus (P<0.01), but not in O. niloticus, which even showed a decreasing tendency with increase in TL and TW. Regression of log THg vs. δ(15)N among all fish species showed a significant correlation, indicating that mercury is biomagnifying along the food web of Lake Ziway. Isotope ratios indicated that C. gariepinus occupied the highest trophic level of the food web of Lake Ziway; but contained similar THg concentrations as T. zillii, which is located at a lower trophic level, probably due to a faster growth rate of C. gariepinus, and thus an example of biodilution.",S0147-6513(11)00006-6 [pii] and 10.1016/j.ecoenv.2011.01.005 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we detected the concentrations of PCBs, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites (DDTs) and hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) in muscle, liver and kidney of birds that inhabit in an e-waste recycling site. Associated with the stable isotope ratio (δ (15)N), we investigated the effect of trophic level on the body burdens of persistent contaminants in birds. The tissue distributions of contaminants in these birds were examined, and a preliminary risk assessment was also conducted. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specimens from eight bird species were collected from Qingyuan County, Guangdong Province, South China. Pectoral muscle, liver and kidney tissues were Soxhlet-extracted and finally dissolved in isooctane. Both PCBs and OCPs were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The subsamples for nitrogen stable isotope analysis were lyophilized, ground and analyzed by a flash EA 112 series elemental analyzer interfaced with an isotope ration mass spectrometer. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: PCBs exhibited the highest concentrations among all target compounds, and a preliminary risk assessment suggested that adverse effects might occur in some birds for its high level. Generally, the concentrations of pollutants in liver and kidney were higher than those in muscle, which was mainly driven by passive diffusion to the 'lipid-compartment'. Significant differences in level of contaminants were obtained among species due to the varieties in dietary composition and habitat. An increasing trend was obtained between concentrations of PCBs and DDTs with trophic levels; however, HCHs exhibited the same level among species. RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: Because of the e-waste recycling activities, the study area has been heavily polluted by PCBs. Studies on the species-specific hazard assessment associated with exposure to PCBs are urgently needed in the study of birds in the area.",10.1007/s11356-010-0397-9 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HgT concentrations were generally lowest in crayfish (0.005-0.112 μg/g dw) and highest in smallmouth (0.093-4.041 μg/g dw), as was δ¹⁵N. HgT was also lower and δ¹⁵N was higher in all biota from a stream draining a more heavily populated historical lead-zinc mining area than from similar sites with mostly undeveloped forested watersheds. δ¹³C in biota was lowest at spring-influenced sites, reflecting CO₂ inputs and temperature influences, and δ³⁴S increased from south to north in all taxa. However, HgT was not strongly correlated with either δ¹³C or δ³⁴S in biota. Trophic position (TP) computed from crayfish δ¹⁵N was lower in hog suckers (mean=2.8) than in smallmouth (mean=3.2), but not at all sites. HgT, δ¹³C, δ³⁴S, and TP in hog suckers increased with total length (length) at some sites, indicating site-specific ontogenetic diet shifts. Changes with length were less evident in smallmouth. Length-adjusted HgT site means in both species were strongly correlated with HgT in crayfish (r²=0.97, P<0.01), but not with HgT in Corbicula (r²=0.02, P>0.05). ANCOVA and regression models incorporating only TP and, for hog suckers, length, accurately and precisely predicted HgT concentrations in both fish species from all locations. Although low compared to many areas of the USA, HgT (and therefore methylmercury) concentrations in smallmouth and hog suckers are sufficiently high to represent a threat to human health and wildlife. Our data indicate that in Ozark streams, Hg concentrations in crayfish are at least partly determined by their diet, with concentrations in hog suckers, smallmouth, and possibly other higher-level consumers largely determined by concentrations in crayfish and other primary and secondary consumers, fish growth rates, and TP.",S0147-6513(11)00251-X [pii] and 10.1016/j.ecoenv.2011.08.008 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The area experiences a humid tropical climate with frequent, high-intensity rainfall (4000 mm annual average). Nevertheless, there is a shortage of water during the peak dry season immediately before the onset of monsoon because of a rapid fall in the groundwater level. From the humid high-altitude forests to the intense agriculture in the coastal area, there is an urgent need to understand the movement of water between evapotranspiration, rainfall, river systems and the groundwater compartments in order to achieve better water resource management. Demographic pressure on the area with over half a million inhabitants and industrial activity strongly influence this fragile ecosystem. The coastal area is characterized by shallow open wells, which are particularly sensitive to pollution and eutrophication. Stable water isotopes ((18)O and deuterium) were used for the first time in this region to determine the isotopic characteristics of the different waters. There is a clear seasonal difference in the isotopic ratios and d-excess values between the summer and winter monsoon periods, with a predominance of lighter isotopes in the latter period. No significant variations in isotopic ratios were observed in relation to altitude because of the possible role of mist formation at high altitude. Greater d-excess values were observed in the west-flowing streams than in rivers flowing east on account of the moist westerly oceanic winds and water vapour recycling.",10.1002/rcm.5104 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most studies addressing the causes of the recent increases and expansions of mesopredators in many ecosystems have focused on the top-down, releasing effect of extinctions of large apex predators. However, in the case of the northward expansion of the red fox into the arctic tundra, a bottom-up effect of increased resource availability has been proposed, an effect that can counteract prey shortage in the low phase of the multi-annual rodent cycle. Resource subsidies both with marine and with terrestrial origins could potentially be involved. 2. During different phases of a multi-annual rodent cycle, we investigated the seasonal dynamics and spatial pattern of resource use by red foxes across a coast to inland low arctic tundra gradient, Varanger Peninsula, Norway. We employed two complementary methods of diet analyses: stomach contents and stable isotope analysis. 3. We found that inland red foxes primarily subsisted on reindeer carrions during the low phase of a small rodent population cycle. Lemmings became the most important food item towards the peak phase of the rodent cycle, despite being less abundant than sympatric voles. Isotopic signatures of tissue from both predator and prey also revealed that red foxes near the coast used marine-derived subsidies in the winter, but these allochthonous resources did not spillover to adult foxes living beyond 20-25 km from the coast. 4. Although more needs to be learned about the link between increasing primary productivity due to climatic warming and trophic dynamics in tundra ecosystems, we suggest that changes in reindeer management through a bottom-up effect, at least regionally, may have paved the way towards the establishment of a new mesopredator in the tundra biome.",10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01840.x [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stable isotope ratios of nitrogen (δ(15)N) and carbon (δ(13)C) are powerful ecological tools that are used to provide a temporally integrated description of the feeding ecology of aquatic animals such as fish. The main objective of this study was to use stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon to determine if dietary changes affected mercury (Hg) and zinc (Zn) accumulation in yellow perch ranging in size from approximately 5 cm to 27 cm. Results showed that Hg bioaccumulation generally increased with increasing trophic level in fish feeding at higher trophic levels, however, the relationship between Hg levels and δ(15)N was non-linear showing no relationship in small fish (less than 15 cm). In contrast, there was a negative, linear relationship between δ(15)N and Zn, suggesting that as perch fed at progressively higher trophic levels, less of Zn bioaccumulated. No relationship was observed between δ(13)C and metal levels in perch. Collectively, these results demonstrate a contrast in the behavior of Zn and Hg bioaccumulation in yellow perch as a function of trophic status.",S0147-6513(11)00445-3 [pii] and 10.1016/j.ecoenv.2011.11.033 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Average δ(13)C and δ(15)N values in oyster shell (-21 ± 1‰ and 9-11‰, respectively) were consistent with consumption of naturally available SPM as opposed to values in oil (-27 ± 0.2‰, 1.6 ± 0.4‰). Stable isotope ratios in oyster adductor muscle were similar to shell for δ(15)N but not δ(13)C, suggesting either a recent shift in diet composition or differential assimilation of C between tissue types. We found no evidence of assimilation of oil-derived C and N and, therefore, no evidence of an oyster-based conduit to higher trophic levels. Trace elements in shell were inconclusive to corroborate oil exposure. These findings are not an indication that oysters were not exposed to oil; rather they imply oysters either did not consume oil-derived materials or consumed too little to be detectable compared to natural diet.",10.1021/es302369h [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Earthworms are ecosystem engineers known to affect the dynamics of SOM. Endogeic earthworms ingest large amounts of soil and assimilate a part of organic matter it contains. During gut transit, microorganisms are transported to new substrates and their activity is stimulated by (i) the production of readily assimilable organic matter (mucus) and (ii) the possible presence of fresh organic residues in the ingested soil.

To further understand the trophodynamics of Cr, As and cobalt (Co), we investigated concentrations and transfer throughout the food web in each basin of Lake Moreno. Each basin differs in morphology in that the gently-sloping Lake Moreno West has more littoral habitat than deeper Lake Moreno East with its higher proportion of pelagic habitat. Despite the morphological differences, both basins share similar water quality parameters and species assemblages. As a result, Lake Moreno provides an exceptional opportunity to compare trophodynamics of elements that enable us to hypothesize pelagic-littoral habitat coupling in response to lake morphology as the underlying factor influencing both Cr pathway and Co and As trophodynamic modeling. Using stable isotopes of nitrogen (δ¹⁵N) and carbon (δ¹³C) to characterize metals trophodynamics in each basin, biodilution of As, Cr and Co were indicated by negative regressions.

In experiment 1, juvenile yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were raised in captivity on commercial food pellets and then their diet was either maintained on unamended food pellets (0.1 μg/g MeHg) or was switched to food pellets with 1.0 μg/g or 4.0 μg/g of added MeHg, for a period of 2 months. The difference in δ(202)Hg (MDF) and Δ(199)Hg (MIF) between fish tissues and food pellets with added MeHg was within the analytical uncertainty (δ(202)Hg, 0.07 ‰; Δ(199)Hg, 0.06 ‰), indicating no isotope fractionation. In experiment 2, lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) were raised in captivity on food pellets and then shifted to a diet of bloater (Coregonus hoyi) for 6 months. The δ(202)Hg and Δ(199)Hg of the lake trout equaled the isotopic composition of the bloater after 6 months, reflecting reequilibration of the Hg isotopic composition of the fish to new food sources and a lack of isotope fractionation during trophic transfer. We suggest that the stable Hg isotope ratios in fish can be used to trace environmental sources of Hg in aquatic ecosystems.",10.1021/es300794q [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the stomach contents, the S. trutta changed their diet at c. 30 cm total length (L(T) ). The smaller size classes fed on benthic invertebrates and surface insects, whereas larger S. trutta (>30 cm) fed mainly on whitefish Coregonus lavaretus. A similar, but more gradual shift to piscivory in the size range 25-30 cm was found when using the stable isotope mixing model SIAR to reveal dietary ontogeny. The δ¹³C isotopic signature confirmed that S. trutta independent of size predominantly relied upon benthic energy sources, suggesting that the littoral zone was the primary foraging habitat for both invertebrate and piscivorous feeders. The δ¹⁵N values and trophic position increased with predator length, ranging from an average of 3·60 for small-sized S. trutta (<15 cm) to 4·15 for large-sized fish (>35 cm). The S. trutta exhibited a relatively slow growth rate during the predominant invertebrate feeding stages up to 7 years of age and 28 cm L(T) , whereas fish above this size and age displayed a rapid growth rate of 9-11 cm year⁻¹, demonstrating the profitability of piscivorous feeding.",10.1111/j.1095-8649.2012.03294.x [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We coupled stable isotope probing (SIP) with 16S rRNA pyrosequencing in dark seawater culture experiments on euphotic and mesopelagic communities from the Sargasso Sea. Parallel cultures were amended with equimolar quantities of four DO(13) C substrates to simultaneously evaluate community utilization and population-specific incorporation. Of the substrates tested - two cyanobacterial products (exudates or lysates from a culture of Synechococcus) and two defined monosaccharides (glucose or gluconic acid) - the cyanobacterial exudates were incorporated by the greatest diversity of oligotrophic bacterioplankton populations in surface waters, including taxa from > 10 major subclades within the Flavobacteria, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Proteobacteria (including SAR11). In contrast, the monosaccharide glucose was not incorporated by any taxa belonging to extant oligotrophic oceanic clades. Conversely, proteobacterial copiotrophs, which were rare in the ambient water (< 0.1% of sequences), grew rapidly on all DOC amendments at both depths, but with different substrate preferences among lineages. We present a new analytical framework for using SIP to detect DOC incorporation across diverse oligotrophic bacterioplankton and discuss implications for the ecology of bacterial-DOC interactions among populations of diverging trophic strategies.",10.1111/j.1462-2920.2012.02738.x [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is still unclear which compartment is the major source or sink due to the lack of estimation and comparison of the net methylmercury (MeHg) production or degradation in these compartments. The lack of this information has limited our understanding of Hg cycling in this ecosystem. This study adopted a double stable isotope ((199)Hg(2+) and Me(201)Hg) addition technique to determine the methylation/demethylation rate constants and the net MeHg production rates in each compartment. This study improved the previous models for estimating these parameters by (1) taking into account the difference between newly input and ambient mercury in methylation/demethylation efficiency and (2) correcting the contribution of photodemethylation to Me(199)Hg concentration when calculating methylation rates in water. The net MeHg production rate in each compartment was then estimated to identify the major sources and sinks of MeHg. The results indicate that these improvements in modeling are necessary, as a significant error would occur otherwise. Soil was identified to be the largest source of MeHg in the Everglades, while the floc and water column were identified as the major sinks. The role of periphyton varies, appearing to be a source in the northern Everglades and a sink in the southern Everglades. Soil could be the largest source for MeHg in the water column, while methylation in periphyton could also contribute significantly in the northern Everglades.",10.1021/es204410x [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both pastures consisted exclusively of C(3) plants. Before the experiment, all animals grazed a common pasture for 6 wk. Grasses and perirenal adipose tissues of the sheep were analyzed for fatty acids by gas chromatography. Stable C-isotope ratios (δ(13)C values in ‰ vs. the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite standard) were determined in the composite samples by elemental analysis-isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The δ(13)C of the individual fatty acids were measured by gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The δ(13)C value of the entire mountain pasture grass was -27.5‰ (SD 0.31), whereas that of the lowland pasture grass was -30.0‰ (SD 0.07). This difference was reflected in the perirenal adipose tissues of the corresponding sheep (P < 0.05), even though the δ(13)C values were less in the animals than in the grass. The δ(13)C values for cis-9 16:1 and cis-9 18:1 in perirenal fat differed between mountain and lowland lambs (P < 0.05). The 16:0 in the adipose tissue was enriched in (13)C by 5‰ compared with the dietary 16:0, likely as a result of partly endogenous synthesis. The δ(13)C values of cis-9,trans-11 18:2 (cis-9,trans-11 CLA) in the adipose tissue were smaller than those of its dietary precursors, cis-9,cis-12 18:2 and cis-9,cis-12,cis-15 18:3; conversely, the δ(13)C values of trans-11 18:1 were not, suggesting that large proportions of perirenal cis-9,trans-11 18:2 were of endogenous origin and discrimination against (13)C occurred during Δ(9)-desaturation. The same discrimination was indicated by the isotopic shift between 16:0 and cis-9 16:1 in the mountain grazing group. Furthermore, the δ(13)C values of cis-9,trans-11 18:2 were smaller relative to the precursor fatty acids in the mountain lambs compared with the lowland group. This result suggests a reduced extent of biohydrogenation in lambs grazing on mountain grass in comparison with those grazing on lowland grass. This was supported by the smaller cis-9,trans-11 18:2 concentrations in total fatty acids found in the adipose tissues of the lowland lambs (P < 0.001). The results of this study demonstrate that natural differences between δ(13)C values of swards from different pastures and the adipose tissue fatty acids could be used as tracers in studies of lipid metabolism in ruminants.",jas.2011-4284 [pii] and 10.2527/jas.2011-4284 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sparrows were captured during the non-breeding season from 2006 to 2008 in North Carolina salt marshes near Wrightsville Beach, New Hanover County. Generalized linear models were used to test for the influence of species, δ(15)N, and δ(13)C on breast feather Hg. The most parsimonious model included species, δ(15)N, and their interaction term and explained 36% of the variation in breast feather Hg. Each species exhibited a different association between breast feather δ(15)N and Hg with Seaside Sparrows showing a positive correlation (r=0.27, P=0.03), Nelson's Sparrows a negative correlation (r=-0.28, P=0.01), and Saltmarsh Sparrows with no significant association. For Saltmarsh Sparrows, δ(15)N and Hg revealed decoupling between breast feather Hg and trophic position. Our results demonstrate that the influence of δ(15)N on breast feather Hg is likely indicative of geographic variation in δ(15)N baselines rather than trophic position.",S0048-9697(12)00005-8 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.01.003 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Freshwater ecosystems may receive higher amounts of subsidies (i.e., resources produced outside the focal ecosystem) than terrestrial ecosystems, potentially leading to increased secondary production in freshwaters. Here we used a meta-analytic approach to quantify the magnitude and direction of subsidy inputs across the freshwater-land interface and to determine subsequent responses in recipient animals. Terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems differed in the magnitude of subsidies they received, with aquatic ecosystems generally receiving higher subsidies than terrestrial ecosystems. Surprisingly, and despite the large discrepancy in magnitude, the contribution of these subsidies to animal carbon inferred from stable isotope composition did not differ between freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, likely due to the differences in subsidy quality. The contribution of allochthonous subsidies was highest to primary consumers and predators, suggesting that bottom-up and top-down effects may be affected considerably by the input of allochthonous resources. Future work on subsidies will profit from a food web dynamic approach including indirect trophic interactions and propagating effects.",10.1890/11-1210.1 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the risk of dispersion and accumulation of ³⁶Cl in the biosphere as a consequence of a potential contamination, there is a need for an appropriate understanding of the chlorine cycling dynamics in the ecosystems. To date, a small number of studies have investigated the chlorine transfer in the ecosystem including the transformation of chloride to organic chlorine but, to our knowledge, none have modelled this cycle. In this study, a model involving inorganic as well as organic pools in soils has been developed and parameterised to describe the biogeochemical fate of chlorine in a pine forest. The model has been evaluated for stable chlorine by performing a range of sensitivity analyses and by comparing the simulated to the observed values. Finally a range of contamination scenarios, which differ in terms of external supply, exposure time and source, has been simulated to estimate the possible accumulation of ³⁶Cl within the different compartments of the coniferous stand. The sensitivity study supports the relevancy of the model and its compartments, and has highlighted the chlorine transfers affecting the most the residence time of chlorine in the stand. Compared to observations, the model simulates realistic values for the chlorine content within the different forest compartments. For both atmospheric and underground contamination scenarios most of the chlorine can be found in its organic form in the soil. However, in case of an underground source, about two times less chlorine accumulates in the system and proportionally more chlorine leaves the system through drainage than through volatilisation.",S0265-931X(11)00309-2 [pii] and 10.1016/j.jenvrad.2011.12.014 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Palaeoenvironmental modelling of δ(13) C and δ(15) N values is crucial in determining whether changes in the stable isotope values are a result of dietary change, rather than temporal or geographical fluctuations in carbon and nitrogen. Investigating faunal dietary behaviour can provide an insight into past foddering and land management strategies. METHODS: Detailed sampling of wild and domestic species for bulk collagen analysis was undertaken in order to characterise geographical variations in δ(13) C and δ(15) N values in the Outer Hebrides and Orkney. Samples from the Neolithic to the Norse period were analysed to assess temporal and geographical variations in δ(13) C and δ(15) N values, in addition to determining the contribution of marine foods to the diet of local fauna. RESULTS: A δ(15) N shift of 1‰ was observed between the Outer Hebrides and Orkney in the Neolithic and Iron Age. A geographical variation in δ(13) C values was observed in the Norse period between Orkney and the Outer Hebrides. Temporal fluctuations in δ(13) C and δ(15) N values demonstrate variations in foddering practices of sheep in the Outer Hebrides. Pig specimens from the Outer Hebrides demonstrated evidence of marine food consumption in the Iron Age. CONCLUSIONS: Faunal dietary behaviour can act as a vital indicator of the importance of marine resources in the past. Characterisation of faunal δ(13) C and δ(15) N values geographically and temporally is crucial in our interpretation of human dietary behaviour.",10.1002/rcm.6319 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We presently investigated the temporal changes (1982-2010) in MeO-PBDPB concentrations and congener patterns, as well as chemical tracers of diet (ratios of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes), in egg pool homogenates from five selected colony sites across the Great Lakes. Egg pool homogenates from the Channel-Shelter (C-S) Island (Lake Huron) contained ∑MeO-PBDPB concentrations orders of magnitude greater than those from other colonies, suggesting potential point contamination sources nearby. In the C-S Island egg pools, concentrations increased from the initial study year (31 ng/g wet weight) and peaked around the late 1990s, followed by a general decline until 2010. Over the period, concentrations generally increased in eggs from Fighting Island (Lake Erie), Toronto Harbour (Lake Ontario) and Big Sister Island (Lake Michigan) colonies, whereas the levels in Agawa Rock (Lake Superior) declined. Although other factors likely exist, changes over time in the carbon and nitrogen isotope tracers reflected a shift of the gull diet from aquatic to more terrestrial origins, and suggested this diet shift partially accounted for the temporal changes of ∑MeO-PBDPB levels in eggs from most colonies. The ratio of Br(6)- to Br(5)-MeO-PBDPB congeners generally decreased over time in the colonies at Channel-Shelter Island, Fighting Island and Agawa Rock. This suggested that Br(5)- versus Br(6)-MeO-PBDPB congeners and/or possibly their nonmethoxylated and higher brominated precursors may have been more abundant in diets of terrestrial origin. Notably, these MeO-PBDPB congeners are not ""emerging"" brominated substances, but rather ""recently discovered"" contaminants since, as of 2011, ∑MeO-PBDPB concentrations have been constantly in the range of 30-100 ng/g ww for at least the last 30 years.",10.1021/es3018978 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biological sciences,"The lemurs of Madagascar represent a prodigious adaptive radiation. At least 17 species ranging from 11 to 160 kg have become extinct during the past 2000 years. The effect of this loss on contemporary lemurs is unknown. The concept of competitive release favours the expansion of living species into vacant niches. Alternatively, factors that triggered the extinction of some species could have also reduced community-wide niche breadth. Here, we use radiocarbon and stable isotope data to examine temporal shifts in the niches of extant lemur species following the extinction of eight large-bodied species. We focus on southwestern Madagascar and report profound isotopic shifts, both from the time when now-extinct lemurs abounded and from the time immediately following their decline to the present. Unexpectedly, the past environments exploited by lemurs were drier than the protected (albeit often degraded) riparian habitats assumed to be ideal for lemurs today. Neither competitive release nor niche contraction can explain these observed trends. We develop an alternative hypothesis: ecological retreat, which suggests that factors surrounding extinction may force surviving species into marginal or previously unfilled niches.",rspb.2012.0727 [pii] and rspb20120727 [pii] and 10.1098/rspb.2012.0727 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concentrations of total mercury (THg), monomethylmercury (MMHg), and total selenium (TSe) were monitored in the bay, the latter of which might reduce Hg toxicity. The food web structure and dolphins' trophic level-specific consumption rates were evaluated using stable isotope ratios of carbon (δ(13) C) and nitrogen (δ(15) N). Regressions developed for Hg biomagnification in the food chain were log10 CTHg (nanograms per gram) =0.27 × δ(15) N (‰) - 0.42, R(2)  =0.87, for THg and log10 CMMHg  =0.33 × δ(15) N (‰) - 1.0, R(2)  =0.93, for MMHg.

The authors evaluated Hg bioaccumulation within and among four snake species (northern watersnakes, Nerodia sipedon; queen snakes, Regina septemvittata; common garter snakes, Thamnophis sirtalis; and rat snakes, Elaphe obsoleta [Pantherophis alleghaniensis]) from a contaminated site on the South River (Waynesboro, VA, USA) and two nearby reference sites. Total Hg (THg) concentrations in northern watersnake tail tissue at the contaminated site ranged from 2.25 to 13.84 mg/kg dry weight (mean: 4.85 ± 0.29), or 11 to 19 times higher than reference sites. Blood THg concentrations (0.03-7.04 mg/kg wet wt; mean: 2.24 ± 0.42) were strongly correlated with tail concentrations and were the highest yet reported in a snake species. Within watersnakes, nitrogen stable isotope values indicated ontogenetic trophic shifts that correlated with THg bioaccumulation, suggesting that diet plays a substantial role in Hg exposure. Female watersnakes had higher mean THg concentrations (5.67 ± 0.46 mg/kg) than males (4.93 ± 0.49 mg/kg), but no significant differences between sexes were observed after correcting for body size. Interspecific comparisons identified differences in THg concentrations among snake species, with more aquatic species (watersnakes and queen snakes) accumulating higher mean concentrations (5.60 ± 0.40 and 4.59 ± 0.38 mg/kg in tail tissue, respectively) than the more terrestrial species, garter snakes and rat snakes (1.28 ± 0.32 and 0.26 ± 0.09 mg/kg, respectively).

By using fossils from the well-dated Shungura Formation (lower Omo Valley, northern Turkana Basin, southern Ethiopia), we investigate palaeodietary changes in one bovid and in one suid lineage from 3 to 2 Ma using stable isotope analysis of tooth enamel. Results show unexpectedly large increases in C(4) dietary intake around 2.8 Ma in both the bovid and suid, and possibly in a previously reported hippopotamid species. Enamel δ(13)C values after 2.8 Ma in the bovid (Tragelaphus nakuae) are higher than recorded for any living tragelaphin, and are not expected given its conservative dental morphology. A shift towards increased C(4) feeding at 2.8 Ma in the suid (Kolpochoerus limnetes) appears similarly decoupled from a well-documented record of dental evolution indicating gradual and progressive dietary change. The fact that two, perhaps three, disparate Pliocene herbivore lineages exhibit similar, and contemporaneous changes in dietary behaviour suggests a common environmental driver. Local and regional pollen, palaeosol and faunal records indicate increased aridity but no corresponding large and rapid expansion of grasslands in the Turkana Basin at 2.8 Ma. Our results provide new evidence supporting ecological change in the eastern African record around 2.8 Ma, but raise questions about the resolution at which different ecological proxies may be comparable, the correlation of vegetation and faunal change, and the interpretation of low δ(13)C values in the African Pliocene.",rsbl.2012.0890 [pii] and rsbl20120890 [pii] and 10.1098/rsbl.2012.0890 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We measured oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios of stem water from herbs, grasses and trees growing side by side, as well as the isotopic composition of water in soil profile, groundwater and rainfall, and predawn (Ψ(pd)) and midday (Ψ(md)) leaf water potentials. We used a stable isotope mixing model to estimate vertical partitioning of soil water by the three growth forms. Grasses relied on shallow soil water (5-50 cm) and were strongly anisohydric. Ψ(pd) and Ψ(md) decreased significantly from the wet to the dry season. Trees extracted water from deeper regions of the soil profile (60-120 cm) and were isohydric. Ψ(pd) and Ψ(md) did not change from the wet to the dry season. Herbs overlapped with grasses in patterns of water extraction in the dry season (between 10 and 40 cm), but they took up water at soil depths intermediate (70-100 cm) to those of trees and grasses during the wet season. They showed seasonal changes in Ψ(pd) but not in Ψ(md).

The presence of sulfate reducing prokaryotes was detected in all compartments (T-RFLP based on dsrAB amplified through nested PCR) and their main role in Hg methylation could be demonstrated. In turn, sulfate reduction inhibition did not affect demethylation activities. The estimation of net MeHg budgets in these ecosystems suggested that aquatic rhizosphere is the principal location for methylmercury production and may represent an important source for the contamination of the aquatic food chain.",S0269-7491(12)00388-0 [pii] and 10.1016/j.envpol.2012.08.004 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In laboratory microcosms, benzene was degraded at rates of ≥ 11 μM per day and per gram coconut textile under oxic conditions. Carbon isotope fractionation with isotopic enrichment factors (ε) of -0.6 to -1‰ and no significant hydrogen isotope fractionation indicated a dihydroxylation reaction for the initial ring attack. The incubation with [(13)C₆]-benzene led to (13)CO₂ formation accompanied by (13)C-labeling of RNA and proteins of the active biomass. Phylogenetic analysis of the (13)C-labeled RNA revealed that phylotypes related to Zoogloea, Ferribacterium, Aquabacterium, and Hydrogenophaga within the Betaproteobacteria predominantly assimilated carbon from benzene. Although the phylogenetic classification of identified (13)C-labeled proteins was biased by the incomplete metagenome information of public databases, it matched with RNA-SIP results at genus level.

The majority of plants support N uptake by symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Mineralization of N is regulated by microfauna, in particular, protozoa grazing on bacteria. We hypothesized that AM fungi and protozoa interactively facilitate plant N nutrition from OM. In soil systems consisting of an OM patch and a root compartment, plant N uptake and consequences for plant carbon (C) allocation were investigated using stable isotopes. Protozoa mobilized N by consuming bacteria, and the mobilized N was translocated via AM fungi to the host plant. The presence of protozoa in both the OM and root compartment stimulated photosynthesis and the translocation of C from the host plant via AM fungi into the OM patch. This stimulated microbial activity in the OM patch, plant N uptake from OM and doubled plant growth. The results indicate that protozoa increase plant growth by both mobilization of N from OM and by protozoa-root interactions, resulting in increased C allocation to roots and into the rhizosphere, thereby increasing plant nutrient exploitation. Hence, mycorrhizal plants need to interact with protozoa to fully exploit N resources from OM.",10.1111/nph.12249 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biological sciences,"Species interactions form food webs, impacting community structure and, potentially, ecological dynamics. It is likely that global climatic perturbations that occur over long periods of time have a significant influence on species interaction patterns. Here, we integrate stable isotope analysis and network theory to reconstruct patterns of trophic interactions for six independent mammalian communities that inhabited mammoth steppe environments spanning western Europe to eastern Alaska (Beringia) during the Late Pleistocene. We use a Bayesian mixing model to quantify the contribution of prey to the diets of local predators, and assess how the structure of trophic interactions changed across space and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), a global climatic event that severely impacted mammoth steppe communities. We find that large felids had diets that were more constrained than those of co-occurring predators, and largely influenced by an increase in Rangifer abundance after the LGM. Moreover, the structural organization of Beringian and European communities strongly differed: compared with Europe, species interactions in Beringian communities before--and possibly after--the LGM were highly modular. We suggest that this difference in modularity may have been driven by the geographical insularity of Beringian communities.",rspb.2013.0239 [pii] and rspb20130239 [pii] and 10.1098/rspb.2013.0239 [doi],Pleistocene and climate change and food webs and mammoth steppe and stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each basin has differing proportions of littoral and pelagic habitats, thereby providing an opportunity to assess the importance of habitat (e.g. food web structure or benthic MeHg production) in the transfer of Hg and Se to top trophic fish species. Pelagic plankton, analyzed in three size classes (10-53, 53-200, and >200 μm), had very high [THg], exceeding 200 μg g(-1) dry weight (DW) in the smallest, and a low ratio of MeHg to THg (0.1 to 3%). In contrast, [THg] in littoral macroinvertebrates showed lower values (0.3 to 1.8 μg g(-1) DW). Juvenile and small fish species feeding upon plankton had higher [THg] (0.2 to 8 μg g(-1) muscle DW) compared to large piscivore fish species (0.1 to 1.6 μg g(-1) muscle DW). Selenium concentrations exhibited a much narrower variation range than THg in the food web, varying from 0.5 to 2.7 μg g(-1) DW. Molar Se:Hg ratios exceeded 1 for the majority of organisms in both basins, with most ratios exceeding 10. Using stable nitrogen isotopes as indicator of trophic level, no significant correlations were found with [THg], [Se] or Se:Hg. The apparent lack of biomagnification trends was attributed to elevated [THg] in plankton in the inorganic form mostly, as well as the possibility of consistent Se supply reducing the biomagnification in the food web of the organic portion of THg.",S0048-9697(13)00299-4 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.03.008 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few records of species that live beyond the continental shelves date back more than 60 y, and the sheer size of oceanic regions makes their food webs difficult to study, even in modern times. Here, we use stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes to study the foraging history of a generalist, oceanic predator, the Hawaiian petrel (Pterodroma sandwichensis), which ranges broadly in the Pacific from the equator to near the Aleutian Islands. Our isotope records from modern and ancient, radiocarbon-dated bones provide evidence of over 3,000 y of dietary stasis followed by a decline of ca. 1.8‰ in δ(15)N over the past 100 y. Fishery-induced trophic decline is the most likely explanation for this sudden shift, which occurs in genetically distinct populations with disparate foraging locations. Our isotope records also show that coincident with the apparent decline in trophic level, foraging segregation among petrel populations decreased markedly. Because variation in the diet of generalist predators can reflect changing availability of their prey, a foraging shift in wide-ranging Hawaiian petrel populations suggests a relatively rapid change in the composition of oceanic food webs in the Northeast Pacific. Understanding and mitigating widespread shifts in prey availability may be a critical step in the conservation of endangered marine predators such as the Hawaiian petrel.",1300213110 [pii] and 201300213 [pii] and 10.1073/pnas.1300213110 [doi],fishing and seabird and stable isotope,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The challenge grows from the uncertainty of N cycle responses and the extent to which shifts in soil N are coupled with the C cycle and productivity of tundra systems. We used a long-term (since 2003) experiment of summer warming and supplemental summer water additions to a High Arctic ecosystem in NW Greenland, and applied a combination of discrete sampling and in situ soil core incubations to measure C and N pools and seasonal microbial processes that might control plant-available N. We hypothesized that elevated temperature and increased precipitation would stimulate microbial activity and net inorganic N mineralization, thereby increasing plant N-availability through the growing season. While we did find increased N mineralization rates under both global change scenarios, water addition also significantly increased net nitrification rates, loss of NO3 (-) -N via leaching, and lowered rates of labile organic N production. We also expected the chronic warming and watering would lead to long-term changes in soil N-cycling that would be reflected in soil δ(15) N values. We found that soil δ(15) N decreased under the different climate change scenarios. Our results suggest that temperature accelerates biological processes and existing C and N transformations, but moisture increases soil hydraulic connectivity and so alters the pathways, and changes the fate of the products of C and N transformations. In addition, our findings indicate that warmer, wetter High Arctic tundra will be cycling N and C in ways that may transform these landscapes in part leading to greater C sequestration, but simultaneously, N losses from the upper soil profile that may be transported to depth dissolved in water and or transported off site in lateral flow.",10.1111/gcb.12318 [doi],carbon and climate change and global warming and mineralization and nitrification and nitrogen and polar semidesert and precipitation and stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Determining how species respond to forest fragmentation is essential for management efforts. We use stable isotope biogeochemistry to investigate how disturbance affects resource partitioning between two genera of cheirogaleid lemurs (Cheirogaleus and Microcebus) from three humid forest sites: continuous and fragmented forest at Tsinjoarivo, and selectively logged forest at Ranomafana. We test three hypotheses: (H1) cheirogaleids are unaffected by forest fragmentation, (H2) species respond individually to disturbance and may exploit novel resources in fragmented habitat, and (H3) species alter their behavior to rely on the same key resource in disturbed forest. We find significant isotopic differences among species and localities. Carbon data suggest that Microcebus feed lower in the canopy than Cheirogaleus at all three localities and that sympatric Cheirogaleus crossleyi and C. sibreei feed at different canopy heights in the fragmented forest. Microcbus have higher nitrogen isotope values than Cheirogaleus at all localities, indicating more faunivory. After accounting for baseline isotope values in plants, our results provide the most support for H3. We find similar isotopic variations among localities for both genera. Small differences in carbon among localities may reflect shifts in diet or habitat use. Elevated nitrogen values for cheirogaleid lemurs in fragments may reflect increased arthropod consumption or nutritional stress. These results suggest that cheirogaleids are affected by forest disturbance in Eastern Madagascar and stress the importance of accounting for baseline isotopic differences in plants in any work comparing localities.",10.1007/s00114-013-1094-6 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Bocherens, Hervé and Drucker, Dorothée G and Madelaine, Stéphane",2014,Evidence for a (15)N positive excursion in terrestrial foodwebs at the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition in south-western France: Implications for early modern human palaeodiet and palaeoenvironment.,Journal of human evolution,"The Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition around 35,000 years ago coincides with the replacement of Neanderthals by anatomically modern humans in Europe. Several hypotheses have been suggested to explain this replacement, one of them being the ability of anatomically modern humans to broaden their dietary spectrum beyond the large ungulate prey that Neanderthals consumed exclusively. This scenario is notably based on higher nitrogen-15 amounts in early Upper Palaeolithic anatomically modern human bone collagen compared with late Neanderthals. In this paper, we document a clear increase of nitrogen-15 in bone collagen of terrestrial herbivores during the early Aurignacian associated with anatomically modern humans compared with the stratigraphically older Châtelperronian and late Mousterian fauna associated with Neanderthals. Carnivores such as wolves also exhibit a significant increase in nitrogen-15, which is similar to that documented for early anatomically modern humans compared with Neanderthals in Europe. A shift in nitrogen-15 at the base of the terrestrial foodweb is responsible for such a pattern, with a preserved foodweb structure before and after the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition in south-western France. Such an isotopic shift in the terrestrial ecosystem may be due to an increase in aridity during the time of deposition of the early Aurignacian layers. If it occurred across Europe, such a shift in nitrogen-15 in terrestrial foodwebs would be enough to explain the observed isotopic trend between late Neanderthals and early anatomically modern humans, without any significant change in the diet composition at the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition.",S0047-2484(14)00019-0 [pii] and 10.1016/j.jhevol.2013.12.015 [doi],Collagen and Early Aurignacian and Stable isotopes and Western Europe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As managers implement recovery plans, shifts in species interactions may occur broadly with potential consequences for ecosystem structure and function. In kelp forests off San Nicolas Island, California, USA, we describe striking changes in size structure and life history traits (e.g., size at maturation and sex change) of a heavily fished, ecologically important predator, the California sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher). These changes occurred in two phases: (1) after intense commercial fishery exploitation in the late 1990s and (2) following recovery in the late 2000s, nearly a decade after management intervention. Using gut contents and stable-isotope values of sheephead and their prey, we found evidence for a dietary niche expansion upon recovery of population size structure to include increased consumption of sea urchins and other mobile invertebrate grazers by larger sized fish. By examining historical diet data and a time series of benthic community composition, we conclude that changes in dietary niche breadth are more likely due to the recovery of size structure from fishing than major shifts in prey availability. Size-dependent predator-prey interactions may have ecosystem consequences and management measures that preserve or restore size structure, and therefore historical trophic roles of key predators, could be vital for maintaining kelp forest ecosystem health.",10.1890/13-0014.1 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the Florida Everglades, seasonal reductions in freshwater flow and precipitation lead to annual migrations of aquatic taxa from marsh habitats to deep-water refugia in estuaries. The timing and intensity of freshwater reductions, however, will be modified by ongoing ecosystem restoration and predicted climate change. Understanding the importance of seasonally pulsed resources to predators is critical to predicting the impacts of management and climate change on their populations. As with many large predators, however, it is difficult to determine to what extent predators like bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) in the coastal Everglades make use of prey pulses currently. We used passive acoustic telemetry to determine whether shark movements responded to the pulse of marsh prey. To investigate the possibility that sharks fed on marsh prey, we modelled the predicted dynamics of stable isotope values in bull shark blood and plasma under different assumptions of temporal variability in shark diets and physiological dynamics of tissue turnover and isotopic discrimination. Bull sharks increased their use of upstream channels during the late dry season, and although our previous work shows long-term specialization in the diets of sharks, stable isotope values suggested that some individuals adjusted their diets to take advantage of prey entering the system from the marsh, and as such this may be an important resource for the nursery. Restoration efforts are predicted to increase hydroperiods and marsh water levels, likely shifting the timing, duration and intensity of prey pulses, which could have negative consequences for the bull shark population and/or induce shifts in behaviour. Understanding the factors influencing the propensity to specialize or adopt more flexible trophic interactions will be an important step in fully understanding the ecological role of predators and how ecological roles may vary with environmental and anthropogenic changes.",10.1111/1365-2656.12106 [doi],food webs and habitat use and movements and shark nursery and trophic ecology and δ13C,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We need to expand our insight between the feeding guilds of fauna and not just count biodiversity. The soil fauna drive nutrient cycling and play a pivotal, but little understood role within both the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles that may be ecosystem dependent. Here, we define the structure of the SFW in two habitats (grassland and woodland) on the same soil type and test the hypothesis that land management would alter the SFW in these habitats. To do this, we census the community structure and use stable isotope analysis to establish the pathway of C and N through each trophic level within the ecosystems. Stable isotope ratios of C and N from all invertebrates were used as a proxy for trophic niche, and community-wide metrics were obtained. Our empirically derived C/N ratios differed from those previously reported, diverging from model predictions of global C and N cycling, which was unexpected. An assessment of the relative response of the different functional groups to the change from agricultural grassland to woodland was performed. This showed that abundance of herbivores, microbivores, and micropredators were stimulated, while omnivores and macropredators were inhibited in the grassland. Differences between stable isotope ratios and community-wide metrics, highlighted habitats with similar taxa had different SFWs, using different basal resources, either driven by root or litter derived resources.

A common dilemma in risk assessment is that monitoring data reveals contaminant concentrations in wildlife, while the source concentrations, route of uptake and acceptable source concentrations remain unsolved. To overcome this problem, different models have been developed in order to obtain more precise risk estimates for the food webs. However, there is still an urgent need for studies combining modelled and measured data in order to verify the functionality of the models. Studies utilising field-collected data covering entire food webs are particularly scarce. This study aims to contribute to tackling this problem by determining the validity of two bioaccumulation models, BIOv1.22 and AQUAWEBv1.2, for application to a multispecies aquatic food web. A small boreal lake, Lake Kernaalanjärvi, in Finland was investigated for its food web structure and concentrations of PCBs in all trophic levels. Trophic magnification factors (TMFs) were used to measure the bioaccumulation potential of PCBs, and the site-specific environmental parameters were used to compare predicted and observed concentrations. Site-specific concentrations in sediment pore water did not affect the modelling endpoints, but accurate site-specific measurements of freely dissolved concentrations in water turned out to be crucial for obtaining realistic model-predicted concentrations in biota. Numerous parameters and snapshot values affected the model performances, bringing uncertainty into the process and results, but overall, the models worked well for a small boreal lake ecosystem.

Isotope labeled plant material has been used in various studies of litter decomposition and soil organic matter formation(1-4). From these and other studies, however, it has become apparent that structural components of plant material behave differently than metabolic components (i.e. leachable low molecular weight compounds) in terms of microbial utilization and long-term carbon storage(5-7). The ability to study structural and metabolic components separately provides a powerful new tool for advancing the forefront of ecosystem biogeochemical studies. Here we describe a method for producing (13)C and (15)N labeled plant material that is either uniformly labeled throughout the plant or differentially labeled in structural and metabolic plant components. Here, we present the construction and operation of a continuous (13)C and (15)N labeling chamber that can be modified to meet various research needs. Uniformly labeled plant material is produced by continuous labeling from seedling to harvest, while differential labeling is achieved by removing the growing plants from the chamber weeks prior to harvest. Representative results from growing Andropogon gerardii Kaw demonstrate the system's ability to efficiently label plant material at the targeted levels. Through this method we have produced plant material with a 4.4 atom%(13)C and 6.7 atom%(15)N uniform plant label, or material that is differentially labeled by up to 1.29 atom%(13)C and 0.56 atom%(15)N in its metabolic and structural components (hot water extractable and hot water residual components, respectively). Challenges lie in maintaining proper temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration, and light levels in an airtight (13)C-CO2 atmosphere for successful plant production. This chamber description represents a useful research tool to effectively produce uniformly or differentially multi-isotope labeled plant material for use in experiments on ecosystem biogeochemical cycling.",51117 [pii] and 10.3791/51117 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the contribution of terrestrial particulate organic carbon (tPOC) from annual leaf fall to lake food webs has not yet been adequately traced and quantified. In this study, we conducted whole-lake experiments to trace artificially added tPOC through the food webs of two shallow lakes of similar eutrophic status, but featuring alternative stable regimes (macrophyte rich vs. phytoplankton dominated). Lakes were divided with a curtain, and maize (Zea mays) leaves were added, as an isotopically distinct tPOC source, into one half of each lake. To estimate the balance between autochthonous carbon fixation and allochthonous carbon input, primary production and tPOC and tDOC (terrestrial dissolved organic carbon) influx were calculated for the treatment sides. We measured the stable isotope ratios of carbon (delta13C) of about 800 samples from all trophic consumer levels and compared them between lake sides, lakes, and three seasons. Leaf litter bag experiments showed that added maize leaves were processed at rates similar to those observed for leaves from shoreline plants, supporting the suitability of maize leaves as a tracer. The lake-wide carbon influx estimates confirmed that autochthonous carbon fixation by primary production was the dominant carbon source for consumers in the lakes. Nevertheless, carbon isotope values of benthic macroinvertebrates were significantly higher with maize additions compared to the reference side of each lake. Carbon isotope values of omnivorous and piscivorous fish were significantly affected by maize additions only in the macrophyte-dominated lake and delta13C of zooplankton and planktivorous fish remained unaffected in both lakes. In summary, our results experimentally demonstrate that tPOC in form of autumnal litterfall is rapidly processed during the subsequent months in the food web of shallow lakes and is channeled to secondary and tertiary consumers predominantly via the benthic pathways. A more intense processing of tPOC seems to be connected to a higher structural complexity in littoral zones, and hence may differ between shallow lakes of alternative stable states.",10.1890/13-0390.1 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fanelli, E and Papiol, V and Cartes, J E and Rodriguez-Romeu, O",2014,Trophic ecology of Lampanyctus crocodilus on north-west Mediterranean Sea slopes in relation to reproductive cycle and environmental variables.,Journal of fish biology,"This study examined the population structure, reproductive cycle and feeding pattern of the lanternfish Lampanyctus crocodilus in the Balearic Basin (north-west Mediterranean Sea) from a depth of 450 to 1800 m and at a seasonal scale. Juveniles were mainly located at shallower depths, but also at deepest stations in autumn, while adults mostly inhabited intermediate depths with their centre of population density (CPD) located at 800-1000 m of depth. The migration of adults to deeper depths was detected in late summer to autumn, probably linked to the occurrence of nepheloid layers at c. 1200 m, which in turn enhances the biomass of the zooplankton prey. The diet was mainly based on euphausiids and mysids, with marked seasonal variations both on the upper (450-800 m) and lower (1000-1800 m), where suprabenthic gammariids and pelagic decapods were also dominant. Stomach fullness increased from winter to autumn on the US, while it had a maximum in spring on the LS, in parallel with high consumption of gelatinous zooplankton, which is probably more available after the phytoplankton bloom in late winter. Reproduction occurred in winter, confirmed by the higher percentage of mature females and high gonadosomatic indices (I(G)) at both depth ranges. Hepatosomatic indices (I(H)) showed an inverse trend to I(G) on the US, except in autumn, and was almost parallel on the LS, probably attributable to the migration of adults, which determined different temporal schemes in energy use and storage for reproduction on the US v. LS. Consistent with the different patterns observed at the two depth ranges, environmental drivers of fullness (i.e. feeding intensity) and I(G) (as a proxy of reproductive cycle) differed on the US and LS. The biomass of mysids and euphausiids was the greatest explanatory variables of fullness on the US and LS, pointing to the increasing feeding intensity when a resource was more available. I(H) also explained fullness, suggesting that greater feeding intensity in pre-reproductive periods enabled energy storage in the liver. I(G) was linked directly (i.e. mysids) or indirectly (i.e. surface primary production recorded 2 months before sampling) to food availability, implying a rapid response to vertical food inputs by deep-sea predators. Also, I(G) in L. crocodilus was related to population density, which suggests aggregations for reproduction. Estimates of L. crocodilus trophic levels, and of other accompanying mesopelagic fishes, indicated that the species feed through a continuum spanning the third trophic level, confirming the key role of mesopelagic fishes in transferring organic carbon between trophic levels. Trophic niche segregation among mesopelagic species was pronounced and non-overlapping groups could be distinguished because of the different vertical distribution and migratory behaviour. The study highlights the important role of the benthic boundary layer in sustaining benthopelagic communities in the deep Mediterranean Sea and the need to study the biology of a species throughout its whole depth range and not just at exploited depths (i.e. fishing grounds).",10.1111/jfb.12378 [doi],Balearic Basin and Myctophidae and biological traits and feeding habits and reproduction and stable isotope analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures were used to assess the effects of the dithiocarbamate fungicide thiram (35 and 170μg/L nominal concentrations) and of a petroleum distillate (0.01, 0.4, 2 and 20mg/L nominal loadings as Hydrocarbon Emulsion or Hydrocarbon Water Accommodated Fraction) on the trophic niche of two freshwater gastropods in artificial streams (Radix peregra) and ponds (Lymnaea stagnalis). Results were analyzed using classical univariate statistical methods and recently proposed uni- and multivariate metrics of the realized trophic niche of species. The trophic niche metrics were highly sensitive to both types of chemicals, but exposure resulted in different response patterns according to the nature of the tested compound. Thiram clearly affected gastropod trophic niche leading to a change in the food resources used and resulting in trophic niche expansion (i.e., increase of diversity of used resources, especially dead animals) or trophic niche contraction (i.e., decrease of diversity of used resources) across time. Both gastropod taxa exposed to hydrocarbons showed a clear trophic niche expansion. Trophic niche metrics therefore provide a promising way of investigating non-lethal effects of exposure to organic chemicals on aquatic invertebrates, and subsequent disturbances in food webs.",S0048-9697(14)00335-0 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.03.005 [doi],Artificial streams and Freshwater snails and Functional endpoints and Petroleum distillate and Pond mesocosms and Thiram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Soft tissues of dead vertebrates are rapidly decomposed by diverse animals. However, decomposition of hard tissues such as hairs and feathers is much slower because only a few animals can digest keratin, a protein that is concentrated in hairs and feathers. Although beetles of the family Trogidae are considered keratin feeders, their ecological function has rarely been explored. Here, we investigated the keratin-decomposition function of trogid beetles in heron-breeding colonies where keratin was frequently supplied as feathers. Three trogid species were collected from the colonies and observed feeding on heron feathers under laboratory conditions. We also measured the nitrogen (δ(15)N) and carbon (δ(13)C) stable isotope ratios of two trogid species that were maintained on a constant diet (feathers from one heron individual) during 70 days under laboratory conditions. We compared the isotopic signatures of the trogids with the feathers to investigate isotopic shifts from the feathers to the consumers for δ(15)N and δ(13)C. We used mixing models (MixSIR and SIAR) to estimate the main diets of individual field-collected trogid beetles. The analysis indicated that heron feathers were more important as food for trogid beetles than were soft tissues under field conditions. Together, the feeding experiment and stable isotope analysis provided strong evidence of keratin decomposition by trogid beetles.",10.1007/s00114-013-1137-z [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High atmospheric Hg emissions and ubiquitous reservoir fisheries may lead to elevated Hg bioaccumulation in Chinese freshwater fishes. However, stocking practices using fast-growing species can result in low fish total Hg (THg) concentrations. Here, we describe Hg transfer within the fish food web of a large subtropical reservoir, Qiandao Hu (Xin'anjiang reservoir) situated in eastern China. We measured food web Hg biomagnification and THg concentrations in 33 species of stocked and wild fishes. Mercury concentrations in most fishes were low, though we also found high Hg concentrations in wild top predators. The food web structure, assessed using stable isotopes of carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N), demonstrated a high degree of omnivory and a long food chain. THg concentrations were highly correlated with fish δ(15)N values. The regression of log10THg against δ(15)N revealed the overall Hg biomagnification rate was low. This study shows that where long food chains exist in subtropical reservoirs, elevated Hg accumulation in top predators can occur despite a low Hg biomagnification rate.",10.1007/s10646-013-1158-6 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Projecting the future adequacy of protected areas requires knowing major factors that drive such changes, and how readily the animals adjust to altered resources. In the Arctic, the viability of habitats for marine birds and mammals often depends on sea ice to dissipate storm waves and provide platforms for resting. However, some wind conditions (including weak winds during extreme cold) can consolidate pack ice into cover so dense that air-breathing divers are excluded from the better feeding areas. Spectacled Eiders (Somateria fischeri) winter among leads (openings) in pack ice in areas where densities of their bivalve prey are quite high. During winter 2009, however, prevailing winds created a large region of continuous ice with inadequate leads to allow access to areas of dense preferred prey. Stable isotope and fatty acid biomarkers indicated that, under these conditions, the eiders did not diversify their diet to include abundant non-bivalve taxa but did add a smaller, less preferred, bivalve species. Consistent with a computer model of eider energy balance, the body fat of adult eiders in 2009 was 33-35% lower than on the same date (19 March) in 2001 when ice conditions allowed access to higher bivalve densities. Ice cover data suggest that the eiders were mostly excluded from areas of high bivalve density from January to March in about 30% of 14 winters from 1998 to 2011. Thus, even without change in total extent of ice, shifts in prevailing winds can alter the areal density of ice to reduce access to important habitats. Because changes in wind-driven currents can also rearrange the dispersion of prey, the potential for altered wind patterns should be an important concern in projecting effects of climate change on the adequacy of marine protected areas for diving endotherms in the Arctic.",10.1890/13-0411.1 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within the Lake Michigan food web, invasive dreissenid mussels have caused rapid changes to food web structure and potentially altered the channels through which consumers acquire energy. We used stable C and N isotopes to determine how Lake Michigan food web structure has changed in the past decade, coincident with the expansion of dreissenid mussels, decreased pelagic phytoplankton production, and increased nearshore benthic algal production. Fish and invertebrate samples collected from sites around Lake Michigan were analyzed to determine taxa-specific 13C:12C (delta13C) and 15N:14N (delta15N) ratios. Sampling took place during two distinct periods, 2002-2003 and 2010-2012, that spanned the period of dreissenid expansion, and included nearshore, pelagic and profundal fish and invertebrate taxa. The magnitude and direction of the delta13C shift indicated significantly greater reliance upon nearshore benthic energy sources among nearly all fish taxa as well as profundal invertebrates following dreissenid expansion. Although the mechanisms underlying this delta13C shift likely varied among species, possible causes include the transport of benthic algal production to offshore waters and increased feeding on nearshore prey items by pelagic and profundal species. delta15N shifts were more variable and of smaller magnitude across taxa, although declines in delta15N among some pelagic fishes suggest a shift to alternative prey resources. Lake Michigan fishes and invertebrates appear to have responded to dreissenid-induced changes in nutrient and energy pathways by switching from pelagic to alternative nearshore energy subsidies. Although large shifts in energy allocation (i.e., pelagic to nearshore benthic) resulting from invasive species appear to affect total production at upper trophic levels, changes in trophic structure and utilization of novel energy pathways may help to stabilize food webs following species invasions.",10.1890/13-0329.1 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An interesting aspect of the impact of regime shift is that alternative regimes may induce distinct shifts in energy pathways; these have been less tested than structural changes. This paper addresses this by using stable isotopes to establish the energy pathways in fish communities. We specifically focus on the impact of regime shift on changes of the energy pathways, and how the magnitude and direction of these changes affect the local community. We found that energy pathways significantly varied among the planktivorous, benthivorous, and piscivorous trophic guilds as a result of the alternative regimes. The regime shift from a clear to a turbid state altered the food web towards planktonic energy pathways and truncated food chain length, which is indicative of less ecological efficiency. This was confirmed by the adaptive foraging strategies of prevalent omnivores in the current communities. These structural and functional characteristics of trophic interactions might not facilitate classic trophic cascading effects in such a turbid regime and suppress the system's response to environmental changes, e.g., nutrient loading, and restoration efforts in turbid to clear water regime shifts.",2878 [pii] and 10.1007/s00442-013-2878-2 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This 'release' from parasites has unstudied implications for native predators feeding on exotic prey. In particular, shifts from native to exotic prey should reduce levels of trophically transmitted parasites. We tested this hypothesis in native populations of pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) in Lake Opinicon, where fish stomach contents were studied intensively in the 1970s, prior to the appearance of exotic zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in the mid-1990s. Zebra mussels were common in stomachs of present-day pumpkinseeds, and stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen confirmed their importance in long-term diets. Because historical parasite data were not available in Lake Opinicon, we also surveyed stomach contents and parasites in pumpkinseed in both Lake Opinicon and an ecologically similar, neighboring lake where zebra mussels were absent. Stomach contents of pumpkinseed in the companion lake did not differ from those of pre-invasion fish from Lake Opinicon. The companion lake, therefore, served as a surrogate ""pre-invasion"" reference to assess effects of zebra mussel consumption on parasites in pumpkinseed. Trophically transmitted parasites were less species-rich and abundant in Lake Opinicon, where fish fed on zebra mussels, although factors other than zebra mussel consumption may contribute to these differences. Predation on zebra mussels has clearly contributed to a novel trophic coupling between littoral and pelagic food webs in Lake Opinicon.",10.1007/s00442-014-2898-6 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data was complemented and analysed according to previous stomach content information and compared with studies performed in the North East Atlantic. Our results revealed that tope sharks fed at a low trophic level and within a more pelagic-based food web when compared with other North Atlantic regions. MixSIR application reflected its piscivorous diet and study area topography, oligotrophic waters and volcanic nature, suggesting the occurrence of a Mid-Atlantic tope shark population.

Methylation of Hg(2+) occurred during the course of the experiment, enhancing the uptake of Hg(2+) spikes.

Gas exchange of oxygen stable isotopes in CO₂ and H₂Ov served as the main tool of investigation and was monitored in real time on Fagus sylvatica saplings using laser spectroscopy. H₂(18)O-labelling showed that drought caused a slower transport of water molecules from soil to shoot, which was indicated by its direct derivation from independently measured concentrations and (18)O/(16)O ratios of CO₂ and H₂Ov, respectively. Furthermore, drought reduced the (18)O equilibrium between H₂O and CO₂ at the shoot level, resulting in less-enriched C(18)OO fluxes from leaf to atmosphere compared with control plants.

However, disturbance should also affect spatial networks by altering habitat heterogeneity and resource availability. Variation in resource availability should perturb the frequency and nature of social and ecological interactions within a population by affecting the spatial distribution of individuals. In disturbed habitats where resources are limiting, spatial relationships should reflect behavioural differences among individuals, with higher-quality resources controlled by dominant individuals. In contrast, all individuals may exploit preferred resources in resource-rich habitats. Environmental variation and population reorganization may also result in variation in morphological, behavioural and ecological traits, which ultimately affect fitness. We addressed these considerations for male tree lizards (Urosaurus ornatus) at three sites that differ in levels of disturbance. The habitats at these localities differed in the availability of live trees, the preferred microhabitat of U. ornatus. In addition, male U. ornatus exhibits a polymorphism in dewlap colour linked with differences in aggression, which should influence their position in a network and access to resources. We applied a network framework to characterize the spatial organization of male morphs at each site and quantified male aggressive behaviour in the laboratory. We also compared body size, body condition, number of bite marks, parasite load and the microhabitat use and diet, of males among the sites. We detected no significant differences in spatial network structure between unburned and infrequently burned sites. However, at a frequently burned site, the network shifted towards geographically closer, heteromorphic male neighbour associations. Males at this site were also larger, more aggressive and had more bite marks but fewer parasites than males at the other sites. Moreover, we detected divergence in microhabitat use and diet among the morphs at the frequently burned site that reflected the shift in spatial network structure and differences in morph behaviour. That is, only more aggressive morphs usurped trees and consumed prey from higher trophic levels. We conclude that environmental variation may influence animal spatial network structure.

Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) was used as a fungicide from 1945, leaving behind many contaminated sites. Very few studies have examined the biodegradation of HCB or the fate of HCB-derived carbon. Here we report that certain bacterial populations are capable of deriving carbon from HCB in contaminated soil under aerobic conditions. These populations are primarily Proteobacteria, including Methylobacterium and Pseudomonas, which predominated as detected by stable isotope probing (SIP) and 16S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing. Due to the nature of SIP, which can be used as a functional method solely for assimilatory processes, it is not possible to elucidate whether these populations metabolized directly HCB or intermediates of its metabolism produced by different populations. The possibility exists that HCB is degraded via the formation of pentachlorophenol (PCP), which is further mineralized. With this in mind, we designed primers to amplify PCP 4-monooxygenase-coding sequences based on the available pcpB gene sequence from Methylobacterium radiotolerans JCM 2831. Based on 16S rRNA gene analysis, organisms closely related to this strain were detected in (13)C-labeled DNA. Using the designed primers, we were able to amplify pcpB genes in both total community DNA and (13)C-DNA. This indicates that HCB might be transformed into PCP before it gets assimilated.

We also use nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes to determine if the dung beetle Saphobius edwardsi will consume marine-derived carrion. Nitrogen isotope ratios indicated trophic generalism in Saphobius dung beetles and this was supported by behavioural observations where a broad range of food resources were utilised. Alternative food resource use was further illustrated experimentally by nitrogen and carbon stable isotope signatures of S. edwardsi, where individuals provided with decomposed squid had δ(15)N and δ(13)C values that had shifted toward values associated with marine diet. Our findings suggest that, in the absence of native mammal dung resources, New Zealand dung beetles have evolved a generalist diet of dung and carrion. This may include marine-derived resources, as provided by the seabird colonies present in New Zealand forests before the arrival of humans. This has probably enabled New Zealand dung beetles to persist in indigenous ecosystems despite the decline of native birds and the introduction of many mammal species.",10.1007/s00442-014-3001-z [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ecological theories predict that individual specialization and population trophic niche are determined by biotic interactions and resource diversity emerging from environmental variations (i.e. ecological opportunities). However, due to the paucity of empirical and experimental demonstrations, the genuine importance of each of these drivers in determining trophic niche attributes is not fully appreciated. The present study aimed at determining the population level and individual responses of brown trout (Salmo trutta) to variations in ecological opportunities (terrestrial prey inputs) and autochthonous prey communities among 10 stream reaches along a riparian condition gradient using individual longitudinal monitoring and stable isotope analyses. Our results suggested that trophic niche diversity varied along the environmental gradient, while individual trophic specialization was indirectly driven by ecological opportunities through strengthened intraspecific competition. Individual diet was repeatable over the study period, and the growth rate of juvenile brown trout increased with their specialization for aquatic predatory invertebrates. Our findings highlight the dual influences of intraspecific competition and ecological opportunities on individual trophic specialization and population trophic niche.",10.1111/1365-2656.12208 [doi],competition and individual performances and inter‐individual variability and riparian land‐use and stable isotope analyses and trophic subsidies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three sites representing a large range of lake benthic-pelagic structures (based on depth and shoreline characteristics) and precipitation regimes were sampled. Nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes (δ(15)N, δ(13)C) were analyzed to assess Hg trophodynamics. Selenium concentrations were determined together with THg in order to consider its potential effect on Hg trophodynamics. High THg concentrations (0.1-255 µg g(-1) dry weight (DW)) were measured in plankton, largely in inorganic form (MeHg: 3-29 ng g(-1) DW, 0.02-7% of THg, in the two larger size classes). A trend of increasing THg concentrations, varying in two to three orders of magnitude, with decreasing plankton size was associated with precipitation measured prior to each sampling event. Passive adsorption of dissolved Hg(2+) from wet deposition and runoff is considered to be the principal Hg uptake mechanism at the base of the pelagic food web. Despite the initially high THg uptake in the smaller plankton classes, the transfer to G. maculatus, and consequently to the entire food web, is likely limited due to low proportion of MeHg to THg in plankton. Furthermore, evidence of G. maculatus with benthic feeding habits having higher impact on MeHg trophic transfer compared to the same species with more pelagic (e.g., zooplankton) feeding habits, was observed. Although there is a high THg uptake in plankton, limited amounts are incorporated in the entire food web from the pelagic compartment.",10.1007/s10646-014-1260-4 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However their effects on biogeochemical cycles have rarely been quantified. We estimated bird numbers, diet (from stable isotope analysis), food supply, and the food consumption on rice fields by overwintering waterbirds in one of the most important areas for rice production in southwestern Europe and a key area for various migrating and resident waterbird species. Herein, we modelled the nutrient (N and P) recycling in rice fields, and their transport to reservoirs. The energy consumption by waterbirds (96,605±18,311 individuals) on rice fields during winter averaged at 89.9±39.0 kJ·m(-2), with its majority (89.9%) belonging to foraging on rice seeds. Thus, the birds removed about 26% of rice seeds leftover after harvest (estimated in 932.5±504.7 seeds·m(-2) in early winter) wherein common cranes and dabbling ducks (four species) were the most important consumers. Waterbirds foraging and roosting in the rice fields recycled more than 24.1 (1.0 kg·ha(-1)) of N and an additional 5.0 tons (0.2 kg·ha(-1)) of P in the Extremadura's rice fields during winter. Additionally, we estimated that 2.3 tons of N and 550 kg of P were removed from rice fields and transported to reservoirs. The seasonal foraging of wildlife should result in a direct benefit for rice farmers by improving nutrient recycling through defecation by waterbirds with respect to artificial fertilisation. Additionally, rice fields located in the cranes' core wintering areas can provide sufficient food supply to induce habitat shift from their traditional wintering habitat in 'dehesas' to rice fields, which causes indirect socioeconomic benefit through reduced acorn consumption by cranes. Our modelling approach may thus be especially helpful for management decisions regarding rice agroecosystems in areas which are also important for the conservation of migratory waterbirds.",S0048-9697(14)01770-7 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.12.068 [doi],Cranes and Dabbling ducks and Ecosystem services and Extremadura and Isotopes and Management and Nitrogen and Phosphorous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Information is lacking about mercury methylation (Km) and demethylation (Kd) rates in periphytic biofilms from the Northern Hemisphere, as well as about the drivers of net MeHg production, hampering ecosystem modeling of Hg cycling. Mercury methylation and demethylation rates were measured in periphytic biofilms growing on submerged plants in a shallow fluvial lake located in a temperate cold region (St. Lawrence River, Quebec, Canada). Incubations were performed in situ within macrophyte beds using low-level spikes of (199)HgO and Me(200)Hg stable isotopes as tracers. A direct relationship was observed between Km (0.002 to 0.137 d(-1)) and [MeHg] in periphyton. A similar relationship was found between Kd (0.096 to 0.334 d(-1)) and [inorganic Hg]. Periphyton of Lake St. Pierre reached high levels of net MeHg production that were two orders of magnitude higher than those found in local sediment.

Biological sciences,"Mercury (Hg) is increasing in marine food webs, especially at high latitudes. The bioaccumulation and biomagnification of methyl mercury (MeHg) has serious effects on wildlife, and is most evident in apex predators. The MeHg body burden in birds is the balance of ingestion and excretion, and MeHg in feathers is an effective indicator of overall MeHg burden. Ivory gulls (Pagophila eburnea), which consume ice-associated prey and scavenge marine mammal carcasses, have the highest egg Hg concentrations of any Arctic bird, and the species has declined by more than 80% since the 1980s in Canada. We used feathers from museum specimens from the Canadian Arctic and western Greenland to assess whether exposure to MeHg by ivory gulls increased from 1877 to 2007. Based on constant feather stable-isotope (δ(13)C, δ(15)N) values, there was no significant change in ivory gulls' diet over this period, but feather MeHg concentrations increased 45× (from 0.09 to 4.11 µg g(-1) in adults). This dramatic change in the absence of a dietary shift is clear evidence of the impact of anthropogenic Hg on this high-latitude threatened species.

Comparisons of isotopic niche space and Schoener diet similarity index suggested a low to moderate degree of niche overlap between fish size groups. The δ(13)C gradient between mangrove and seagrass prey as well as results of Bayesian mixing models revealed that sampled fishes relied mostly on seagrass prey items. Only small and large juveniles of the carnivorous species L. apodus derived a part of their diet from mangroves by targeting mangrove-associated Grapsidae crabs and fish prey, respectively. Isotopic niche shifts were particularly obvious for carnivorous fishes that ingested larger prey items (Xanthidae crabs and fishes) during their ontogeny. The utilization of mangrove food resources is less than expected and depends on the ecology and life history of the fish species considered.

In addition, we checked the modulated patterns of DNA repair and heat shock protein (hsp) chaperoning genes of P. nana. UV-B radiation induced a significant reduction (7-87%) of the re-brooding rate of ovigerous females, indicating that UV-induced egg sac damage is closely correlated with a reduction in the hatching rate of UV-irradiated ovigerous female offspring. Using chlorophyll a and stable carbon isotope incubation experiments, we found a dose-dependent decrease (P<0.05) in food ingestion and the rate of assimilation to the body in response to UV radiation, implying that P. nana has an underlying ability to shift its balanced-energy status from growth and reproduction to DNA repair and adaptation. Also, expression of P. nana base excision repair (BER)-associated genes and hsp chaperoning genes was significantly increased in response to UV radiation in P. nana.

"Ross, Alastair B",2015,Whole grains beyond fibre: what can metabolomics tell us about mechanisms?,The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society,"Dietary fibre alone does not fully explain the frequent association between greater intake of whole grains and reduced risk of disease in observational studies, and other phytochemicals or food structure may also play an important role. For all the observational evidence for the benefits of a whole-grain-rich diet, we have only limited knowledge of the mechanisms behind this reduction in disease risk, aside from the action of specific cereal fibres on reduction of blood cholesterol and the post-prandial glucose peak. Nutritional metabolomics, the global measurement and interpretation of metabolic profiles, assesses the interaction of food with the endogenous gene-protein cascade and the gut microbiome. This approach allows the generation of new hypotheses which account for systemic effects, rather than just focusing on one or two mechanisms or metabolic pathways. To date, animal and human trials using metabolomics to investigate mechanistic changes to metabolism on eating whole grains and cereal fractions have led to new hypotheses around mechanistic effects of whole grains. These include the role of cereals as a major source of dietary glycine betaine, a possible effect on phospholipid synthesis or metabolism, the role of branched-chain amino acids and improvements in insulin sensitivity, and the possibility that whole grains may have an effect on protein metabolism. These hypotheses help explain some of the observed effects of whole grains, although mechanistic studies using stable isotopes and fully quantitative measures are required to confirm these potential mechanisms.",S0029665114001542 [pii] and 10.1017/S0029665114001542 [doi],BCAA branched-chain amino acid and Betaine: Health benefits and Insulin sensitivity and Metabolomics and Protein turnover and Whole grains,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Rose, Kevin C and Williamson, Craig E and Kissman, Carrie E H and Saros, Jasmine E",2015,Does allochthony in lakes change across an elevation gradient?,Ecology,"Ecosystems are subsidized with inputs of mass and energy from their surroundings. These allochthonous inputs regulate many ecosystem characteristics. In inland waters, terrestrial inputs of organic matter regulate food-web structure, ecosystem metabolism, water clarity, and thermal stratification. Future changes in allochthony may be especially pronounced in high-elevation ecosystems due to increases in vegetation and precipitation associated with climate change. Several techniques exist to characterize the degree of allochthony of organic matter in aquatic systems, including metrics such as ΔH, the net isotopic discrimination between water and particulate organic matter (POM) of deuterium stable isotopes, and the fluorescence index (FI), which characterizes the fluorescence of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Despite the importance of allochthonous organic carbon inputs, little is known about either how allochthony varies across elevation gradients or whether different metrics are similarly related to allochthony. We measured AH, FI, and a suite of related water-quality characteristics in 30 lakes across a montane to alpine elevation gradient (2340 to 3205 m) in the Beartooth Mountains of Montana and Wyoming, USA, to understand how FI and AH varied with elevation, with one another, and with other allochthony-related water-quality characteristics. We hypothesized that allochthony of POM and DOM would decrease at higher elevations, with alpine lakes above treeline being more autochthonous compared with low-elevation lakes below treeline. We observed a significant inverse linear relationship between AH and Fl, with both metrics indicating a decrease in allochthony at higher elevations. Characteristics including the natural log of the ratio of concentrations of dissolved organic carbon to chlorophyll a (ln(DOC: Chl)), the spectral slope ratio between different spectra of two wavebands (SR, ratio of spectra at 275-295 to 350-400 nm), and a ratio of diffuse attenuation coefficients at 320 and 380 nm (KR, Kd320: Kd380) varied with both ΔH and FI while pH varied only with ΔH. High-elevation systems were characterized by low ln(DOC: Chl) and K(R), and high S(R) and pH. These results indicate that high-elevation lakes are more autochthonous than low-elevation lakes. The relationships among ΔH, FI, elevation, and other water-quality characteristics provide important insights to understand future changes in carbon cycling in mountain ecosystems.",10.1890/14-1558.1 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the environmental compartments, seawater covers most of the earth's surface and may be directly or indirectly impacted. The interaction between radionuclides and the marine compartment is therefore essential for better understanding the transfer mechanisms from the hydrosphere to the biosphere. This information allows for the evaluation of the impact on humans via our interaction with the biotope that has been largely undocumented up to now. In this report, we attempt to make a link between the speciation of heavy elements in natural seawater and their uptake by a model marine organism. More specifically, because the interaction of actinides with marine invertebrates has been poorly studied, the accumulation in a representative member of the Mediterranean coralligenous habitat, the sponge Aplysina cavernicola, was investigated and its uptake curve exposed to a radiotracer (241)Am was estimated using a high-purity Ge gamma spectrometer. But in order to go beyond the phenomenological accumulation rate, the speciation of americium(III) in seawater must be assessed. The speciation of (241)Am (and natural europium as its chemically stable surrogate) in seawater was determined using a combination of different techniques: Time-Resolved Laser-Induced Fluorescence (TRLIF), Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) at the LIII edge, Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and the resulting data were compared with the speciation modeling. In seawater, the americium(III) complex (as well as the corresponding europium complex, although with conformational differences) was identified as a ternary sodium biscarbonato complex, whose formula can be tentatively written as NaAm(CO3)2·nH2O.

Mounting evidence has confirmed the significant importance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) in nitrification, plant nitrogen availability and atmospheric N2 O emissions, but their responses to environmental perturbations in drylands remain largely unknown. Here we evaluate how the factorial combinations of irrigation and fertilization in forests and land-use change from grassland to forest affects the dynamics of AOA and AOB following a 6-year dryland field study. Potential nitrification rates and AOA and AOB abundances were significantly higher in the irrigated plots, accompanied by considerable changes in community compositions, but their responses to fertilization alone were not significant. DNA-stable isotope probing results showed increased (13) CO2 incorporation into the amoA gene of AOA, but not of AOB, in plots receiving water addition, coupled with significantly higher net mineralization and nitrification rates. High-throughput microarray analysis revealed that active AOA assemblages belonging to Nitrosopumilus and Nitrosotalea were increasingly labelled by (13) CO2 following irrigation. However, no obvious effects of land-use changes on nitrification rates or metabolic activity of AOA and AOB could be observed under dry conditions. We provide evidence that water addition had more important roles than nitrogen fertilization in influencing the autotrophic nitrification in dryland ecosystems, and AOA are increasingly involved in ammonia oxidation when dry soils become wetted.",10.1111/1462-2920.12481 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mercury concentrations declined from May through July to October in both tissues, while concentrations of Cd were similar in May and July and lower in October. A decline in TP between May and July, indicating a shift from fish-based diet towards an invertebrate-based diet explains the declining Hg concentration. The low Hg and Cd concentrations in October may be a result of an increased elimination, probably related to moulting. Selenium decreased in the same manner as Hg in liver and muscle, possibly related to the formation of Se-Hg complexes. Zinc and Cu did not fluctuate in muscle tissue, whereas hepatic Zn concentrations where highest in May. Hepatic Zn concentrations were higher in females compared to males in May, possibly related to egg production.

Complete defaunation or decreasing density of less-tolerant taxa occurred under hypoxia during warmer months, especially at subtidal or sulfidic stations; this was followed by rapid recolonization by opportunistic polychaetes in fall-winter. Sedimentary H2S increased the mortality of macroinvertebrates under hypoxia or delayed population recovery during recolonization. The density of several polychaetes (e.g., Pseudopolydora reticulata) declined in winter, coincident with immigration of the predator Armandia lanceolata. This suggests that absence of A. lanceolata under moderate hypoxia enabled the proliferation of prey taxa.

The abundant and widespread unicellular cyanobacteria group A (UCYN-A) has recently been found to live symbiotically with a haptophyte. Here, we investigated the effect of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), iron (Fe) and Saharan dust additions on nitrogen (N2) fixation and primary production by the UCYN-A-haptophyte association in the subtropical eastern North Atlantic Ocean using nifH expression analysis and stable isotope incubations combined with single-cell measurements. N2 fixation by UCYN-A was stimulated by the addition of Fe and Saharan dust, although this was not reflected in the nifH expression. CO2 fixation by the haptophyte was stimulated by the addition of ammonium nitrate as well as Fe and Saharan dust. Intriguingly, the single-cell analysis using nanometer scale secondary ion mass spectrometry indicates that the increased CO2 fixation by the haptophyte in treatments without added fixed N is likely an indirect result of the positive effect of Fe and/or P on UCYN-A N2 fixation and the transfer of N2-derived N to the haptophyte. Our results reveal a direct linkage between the marine carbon and nitrogen cycles that is fuelled by the atmospheric deposition of dust. The comparison of single-cell rates suggests a tight coupling of nitrogen and carbon transfer that stays balanced even under changing nutrient regimes. However, it appears that the transfer of carbon from the haptophyte to UCYN-A requires a transfer of nitrogen from UCYN-A. This tight coupling indicates an obligate symbiosis of this globally important diazotrophic association.",ismej2014253 [pii] and 10.1038/ismej.2014.253 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The HCs were retrieved from a series of sediment cores from different depths. The HC δ(13)C values started to decrease with the onset of eutrophication. The HC δ(13)C temporal patterns varied among depths, which revealed spatial differences in the contribution of methanotrophic bacteria to the benthic secondary production. The estimates of the methane (CH4)-derived C contribution to chironomid biomass ranged from a few percent prior to the 1930s to up to 30 % in recent times. The chironomid fluxes increased concomitantly with changes in HC δ(13)C values before a drastic decrease due to the development of hypoxic conditions. The hypoxia reinforced the implication for CH4-derived C transfer to chironomid production. In Lake Annecy, the HC δ(13)C values were negatively correlated to total organic C (TOC) content in the sediment (Corg), whereas no relationship was found in Lake Bourget. In Lake Bourget, chironomid abundances reached their maximum with TOC contents between 1 and 1.5 % Corg, which could constitute a threshold for change in chironomid abundance and consequently for the integration of CH4-derived C into the lake food webs. Our results indicated that the CH4-derived C contribution to the benthic food webs occurred at different depths in these two large, deep lakes (deep waters and sublittoral zone), and that the trophic transfer of this C was promoted in sublittoral zones where O2 gradients were dynamic.",10.1007/s00442-015-3225-6 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Isotope signatures of the co-cultured sea cucumber at the IMTA site differed from those at the control site, indicating their assimilation of aquaculture wastes. In contrast, δ(13)C and δ(15)N of individual taxa of the cultured oyster and uncultured invertebrates were consistent between sites, suggesting a minor contribution of the aquaculture waste to benthic and pelagic food chains in and around the IMTA system.

In the present study, an ecosystem-scale model has been applied to determine how selenium in a seagrass food web is processed from sediments and water through diet to predators, using stable isotopes (δ(13) C and δ(15) N) to establish the trophic position of organisms. Trophic position, habitat, and feeding zone were examined as possible factors influencing selenium bioaccumulation. Selenium concentrations ranged from 0.2 μg/g dry weight in macroalgae species to 12.9 μg/g in the carnivorous fish Gerres subfasciatus. A mean magnification factor of 1.39 per trophic level showed that selenium is biomagnifying in the seagrass food web. Habitat and feeding zone influenced selenium concentrations in invertebrates, whereas feeding zone was the only significant factor influencing selenium concentrations in fish. The sediment-water partitioning coefficient (Kd ) of 4180 showed that partitioning of selenium entering the lake to particulate organic material (POM) is occurring, and consequently availability to food webs from POM is high. Trophic transfer factors (invertebrate = 1.9; fish = 1.2) were similar to those reported for other water bodies, showing that input source is not the main determinant of the magnitude of selenium bioaccumulation in a food web, but rather the initial partitioning of selenium into bioavailable POM.

In addition to direct ecotoxicity, the bioconcentration of PC in organisms is a phenomenon which could have an impact on the whole ecosystem. In order to study this phenomenon, we exposed unicellular algae (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) to (15)N-tamoxifen, an anticancer drug labelled with a stable nitrogen isotope used as a tracer. By measuring (15)N enrichment over time, we were able to measure the increase of tamoxifen content in algae. This enrichment was measured by an elemental analyser coupled with an isotopic ratio mass spectrometer (EA-IRMS). Algal cells were exposed for 7d to 3 concentrations of tamoxifen: 1, 10 and 100μgL(-1). Our result shows a high bioconcentration in algae from the first minutes of contact. The highest bioconcentration factor measured is around 26500. We also observe that bioconcentration is not linked to the exposure concentration.

Part A, Molecular & integrative and physiology","Reproductive success of seabirds is tightly associated with availability of their prey for which the spatiotemporal distribution may be influenced by sea surface temperature (SST) fluctuations. The objective of this study was to investigate whether Northern gannets (Morus bassanus) from the largest colony in North America (Bonaventure Island, Quebec, Canada) were in negative nutritional state during the unprecedented low reproductive success year of 2012, and whether this was associated with changes in SST anomalies and diet. The incubation period of gannets in 2012 was characterized by a significant decline, from early to late incubation, in plasma triglyceride levels that was associated with an increase in plasma corticosterone levels. However, no changes in plasma glycerol and β-hydroxybutyrate levels were noted. SST anomalies recorded in this area (south of the Gulf of St. Lawrence) during the breeding period were consistently higher in 2012 compared to the previous year (a better reproductive success year). Based on signatures of stable carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) isotopes in gannet red blood cells and in whole fish homogenates of three major preys (mackerel, herring, and capelin), a minor dietary shift was noted between those years and incubation periods. In light of these findings, it is suggested that the extreme warm-water perturbation event that prevailed in the Gulf of St. Lawrence during summer 2012 was associated with a rapid deterioration of nutritional condition of Bonaventure Island gannets during the incubation.

Log10THg increased significantly with δ(15)N and trophic position from invertebrates (0.01 ± 0.01 μg · g(-1) [113 ± 1 ng · g(-1)] dw in copepods) to Greenland Sharks (3.54 ± 1.02 μg · g(-1)). The slope of the log10THg vs. δ(15)N linear regression was higher for pelagic compared to benthic food web components (excluding Greenland Sharks, which could not be assigned to either food web), which resulted from THg concentrations being higher at the base of the benthic food web (i.e., in benthic than pelagic primary consumers). However, feeding habitat is unlikely to consistently influence shark THg exposure in Cumberland Sound because THg concentrations did not consistently differ between benthic and pelagic shark prey. Further, size, gender and feeding behavior (inferred from stable isotopes and fatty acids) were unable to significantly explain THg variability among individual Greenland Sharks. Possible reasons for this result include: 1) individual sharks feeding as generalists, 2) high overlap in THg among shark prey, and 3) differences in turnover time between ecological tracers and THg. This first assessment of Greenland Shark THg within an Arctic food web revealed high concentrations consistent with biomagnification, but low ability to explain intra-specific THg variability. Our findings of high THg levels and consumption of multiple prey types, however, suggest that Greenland Sharks acquire THg through a variety of trophic pathways and are a significant contributor to the total biotic THg pool in northern seas.",S0048-9697(14)00158-2 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.01.128 [doi],Fatty acid and Food web and Greenland Shark and Mercury biomagnification and Stable isotope and Trophic transfer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined food web structure (using carbon and nitrogen isotopes, δ(13)C and δ(15)N) and mercury (Hg) bioaccumulation and biomagnification in a small recurring polynya ecosystem near Nasaruvaalik Island (Nunavut, Canada). Methyl Hg (MeHg) concentrations increased by more than 50-fold from copepods (Calanus hyperboreus) to Arctic terns (Sterna paradisaea), the abundant predators at this site. The biomagnification of MeHg through members of the food web - using the slope of log MeHg versus δ(15)N - was 0.157 from copepods (C. hyperboreus) to fish. This slope was higher (0.267) when seabird chicks were included in the analyses. Collectively, our results indicate that MeHg biomagnification is occurring in this small polynya and that its trophic transfer is at the lower end of the range of estimates from other Arctic marine ecosystems. In addition, we measured Hg concentrations in some poorly studied members of Arctic marine food webs [e.g. Arctic alligatorfish (Ulcina olrikii) and jellyfish, Medusozoa], and found that MeHg concentrations in jellyfish were lower than expected given their trophic position. Overall, these findings provide fundamental information about food web structure and mercury contamination in a small Arctic polynya, which will inform future research in such ecosystems and provide a baseline against which to assess changes over time resulting from environmental disturbance.",S0048-9697(14)01117-6 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.07.087 [doi],Arctic and Biomagnification and Food web and Methylmercury and Polynya and Stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, few studies have examined factors affecting the variable Hg concentrations in landlocked Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) or the biomagnification of Hg through their food webs. We estimated the food web structure of six high Arctic lakes near Resolute Bay, Nunavut, Canada, using stable carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) isotopes and measured Hg (total Hg (THg) in char, the only fish species, and methylmercury (MeHg) in chironomids and zooplankton) concentrations in biota collected in 2010 and 2011. Across lakes, δ(13)C showed that benthic carbon (chironomids) was the dominant food source for char. Regression models of log Hg versus δ(15)N (of char and benthic invertebrates) showed positive and significant slopes, indicting Hg biomagnification in all lakes, and higher slopes in some lakes than others. However, no principal components (PC) generated using all water chemistry data and physical characteristics of the lakes predicted the different slopes. The PC dominated by aqueous ions was a negative predictor of MeHg concentrations in chironomids, suggesting that water chemistry affects Hg bioavailability and MeHg concentrations in these lower-trophic-level organisms. Furthermore, regression intercepts were predicted by the PCs dominated by catchment area, aqueous ions, and MeHg. Weaker relationships were also found between THg in small char or MeHg in pelagic invertebrates and the PCs dominated by catchment area, and aqueous nitrate and MeHg. Results from these high Arctic lakes suggest that Hg biomagnification differs between systems and that their physical and chemical characteristics affect Hg concentrations in lower-trophic-level biota.",S0048-9697(14)00664-0 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.04.133 [doi],Arctic char and Biomagnification and Food web and Mercury and Principal component analysis and Stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we present a historical record of major alterations of trophic structure by revealing millennium-scale dietary shifts of brown bears (Ursus arctos) on the Hokkaido islands, Japan, using carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur stable isotope analysis. Dietary analysis of brown bears revealed that salmon consumption by bears in the eastern region of Hokkaido significantly decreased from 19% to 8%. In addition, consumption of terrestrial animals decreased from 56% to 5% in western region, and 64% to 8% in eastern region. These dietary shifts are likely to have occurred in the last approximately 100-200 years, which coincides with the beginning of modernisation in this region. Our results suggest that human activities have caused an alteration in the trophic structure of brown bears in the Hokkaido islands.

We examined the effects of changes in trophic position of an Arctic-breeding seabird, the thick-billed murre (Uria lomvia), on declining rates of six major organochlorines (hexachlorobenzene, heptachlor epoxide, oxychlordane, dieldrin, p,p'-DDE and Σ69PCB) at two breeding colonies in the Canadian Arctic, one in northern Hudson Bay and one in the high Arctic. As a result of a change in diet, murres breeding in Hudson Bay lowered their trophic position during 1993-2013. After adjusting for the change in trophic position using egg δ(15)N values, the rates of decline in concentrations of all six organochlorines were reduced in the Hudson Bay murre eggs. In contrast, the murres at the high Arctic colony experienced an increase in trophic position which resulted in an increase in the rates of decline for all adjusted concentrations, except for p,p'-DDE and Σ69PCB which remained relatively unchanged. This suggests that the dramatic reduction in emissions of these compounds during the 1970s/1980s had a greater influence on the time trends than changes in diet at the high Arctic colony. Linkages between climate change and food web processes are complex, and may have serious consequences for our understanding of contaminant temporal trends.

Here, we document a >50% decline in production of a native C3 grassland over four decades and assign the forcing and timing to increasing aridity and specifically to declining late-summer rainfall. Analysis of C and N stable isotopes in biomass suggests that enhanced water use efficiency via CO2 enrichment may have slightly ameliorated the productivity decline but that changes in N had no effects. Identical declines in a long-term snow-addition experiment definitively identified increasing late-summer dryness as the cause.

We found that some-but not all-ant species living in Manhattan's most urbanized habitats had δ(13)C signatures associated with processed human foods. In particular, pavement ants (Tetramorium sp.

By contrast, we detected no differences in δ(15)N, suggesting Tetramorium feeds at the same trophic level despite shifting to human foods. This pattern persisted across the broader ant community; species in traffic islands used human resources more than park species.

We still have little knowledge on C partitioning into various cellular compounds and metabolic pathways at various ecophysiological stages. We used compound-specific stable isotope analysis to investigate C partitioning of freshly assimilated C into tree compartments (needles, branches and stem) as well as into needle water-soluble organic C (WSOC), non-hydrolysable structural organic C (stOC) and individual chemical compound classes (amino acids, hemicellulose sugars, fatty acids and alkanes) of Norway spruce (Picea abies) following in situ (13)C pulse labelling 15 days after bud break. The (13)C allocation within the above-ground tree biomass demonstrated needles as a major C sink, accounting for 86% of the freshly assimilated C 6 h after labelling. In needles, the highest allocation occurred not only into the WSOC pool (44.1% of recovered needle (13)C) but also into stOC (33.9%). Needle growth, however, also caused high (13)C allocation into pathways not involved in the formation of structural compounds: (i) pathways in secondary metabolism, (ii) C-1 metabolism and (iii) amino acid synthesis from photorespiration. These pathways could be identified by a high (13)C enrichment of their key amino acids. In addition, (13)C was strongly allocated into the n-alkyl lipid fraction (0.3% of recovered (13)C), whereby (13)C allocation into cellular and cuticular exceeded that of epicuticular fatty acids. (13)C allocation decreased along the lipid transformation and translocation pathways: the allocation was highest for precursor fatty acids, lower for elongated fatty acids and lowest for the decarbonylated n-alkanes. The combination of (13)C pulse labelling with compound-specific (13)C analysis of key metabolites enabled tracing relevant C allocation pathways under field conditions. Besides the primary metabolism synthesizing structural cell compounds, a complex network of pathways consumed the assimilated (13)C and kept most of the assimilated C in the growing needles.",tpv083 [pii] and 10.1093/treephys/tpv083 [doi],amino acid pathways and carbohydrate turnover and carbon allocation and compound-specific isotope analysis and lipid biosynthesis and metabolite tracing and photosynthetic partitioning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sharks, however, have a variety of feeding and life history strategies and metabolize lipid uniquely. Because of this diversity, and the lipid-association of organochlorines, the dynamics of organochlorine accumulation in sharks may be predicted ineffectively by stable isotope-derived trophic position and body mass, as is typical for other taxa. The present study compared ontogenetic organochlorine profiles in the dusky shark (Carcharhinus obscurus) and white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), which differ in metabolic thermoregulation and trophic position throughout their ontogeny. Although greater organochlorine concentrations were observed in the larger bodied and higher trophic position white shark (e.g., p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene: 20.2 ± 2.7 ng/g vs 9.3 ± 2.2 ng/g in the dusky shark), slopes of growth-dilution corrected concentrations with age were equal to those of the dusky shark. Similar ontogenetic trophic position increases in both species, less frequent white shark seal predation than previously assumed, or inaccurate species-specific growth parameters are possible explanations.

We examined this question by comparing the blubber fatty acid (FA) composition and stable carbon isotope ratios of individual FA (δ¹³CFA) of adult ringed seals (Pusa hispida), bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus), spotted seals (Phoca largha), and ribbon seals (Histriophoca fasciata), collectively known as ""ice seals,"" sampled during an anomalously warm, low sea ice period in 2002-2005 in the Bering Sea and a subsequent cold, high sea ice period in 2007-2010. δ¹³C(FA) values, used to estimate the contribution to seals of carbon derived from sea ice algae (sympagic production) relative to that derived from water column phytoplankton (pelagic production), indicated that during the cold period, sympagic production accounted for 62-80% of the FA in the blubber of bearded seals, 51-62% in spotted seals, and 21-60% in ringed seals. Moreover, the δ¹³CFA values of bearded seals indicated a greater incorporation of sympagic FAs during the cold period than the warm period. This result provides the first empirical evidence of an ecosystem-scale effect of a putative change in sympagic production in the Western Arctic. The FA composition of ice seals showed clear evidence of resource partitioning among ringed, bearded, and spotted seals, and little niche separation between spotted and ribbon seals, which is consistent with previous studies. Despite interannual variability, the FA composition of ringed and bearded seals showed little evidence of differences in diet between the warm and cold periods. The findings that sympagic production contributes significantly to food webs supporting ice seals, and that the contribution apparently is less in warm years with low sea ice, raise an important concern: Will the projected warming and continuing loss of seasonal sea ice in the Arctic, and the associated decline of organic matter input from sympagic production, be compensated for by pelagic production to satisfy both pelagic and benthic carbon and energy needs?",10.1890/14-2421 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Different aqueous and terrestrial samples such as soil, sediment, plants, and invertebrates were collected and analyzed for tri- to heptabrominated PBDEs. Furthermore, the food web structure was elucidated using stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes. The highest PBDE levels were found for sediment- and soil-dwelling invertebrates, such as earthworms (Σ13 PBDEs 144 ng/g lipid weight), Tubifex tubifex (77 ng/g lw), and scarab larvae (49 ng/g lw). Differences in congener composition profiles among the different matrices show that the environmental distribution and fate of PBDEs in ecosystems can be very complex. Among the analyzed PBDEs in this ecosystem, the tetra-brominated BDE-47 was the dominant PBDE congener and followed by the penta-brominated BDE-99. A potential trend of increasing BDE-47/99 ratio with the increase of δ(15)N was observed for species with similar energy sources (δ(13)C), indicating a higher bioaccumulation potential for BDE-47 in this ecosystem. A significant correlation was also found between PBDEs and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), indicating similar sources and fate between the two compound groups in this area.

Values of δ(15) N correlated with protein content of marram and strongly related to pupping-seal densities, and positively influenced selective foraging by horses. The latter was density dependent, consistent with optimal foraging theory.

Among 250 known human EIDs, many have been traced to tropical rain forests and specifically freshwater aquatic systems, which act as an interface between microbe-rich sediments or substrates and terrestrial habitats. Along with the rapid urbanization of developing countries, population encroachment, deforestation, and land-use modifications are expected to increase the risk of EID outbreaks. We show that the freshwater food-web collapse driven by land-use change has a nonlinear effect on the abundance of preferential hosts of a generalist bacterial pathogen, Mycobacterium ulcerans. This leads to an increase of the pathogen within systems at certain levels of environmental disturbance. The complex link between aquatic, terrestrial, and EID processes highlights the potential importance of species community composition and structure and species life history traits in disease risk estimation and mapping.

As extant apes live in C(3)-dominated habitats, variation in isotope signatures is assumed to be low compared to hominoids exploiting C(4)-plant resources. However, isotopic differences between sites and between and within individuals are poorly understood due to the lack of vegetation baseline data. In this comparative study, we included all species of free-ranging African great apes (Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus, Gorilla sp.). First, we explore differences in isotope baselines across different habitats and whether isotopic signatures in apes can be related to feeding niches (faunivory and folivory). Secondly, we illustrate how stable isotopic variations within African ape populations compare to other extant and extinct primates and discuss possible implications for dietary flexibility. Using 701 carbon and nitrogen isotope data points resulting from 148 sectioned hair samples and an additional collection of 189 fruit samples, we compare six different great ape sites. We investigate the relationship between vegetation baselines and climatic variables, and subsequently correct great ape isotope data to a standardized plant baseline from the respective sites. We obtained temporal isotopic profiles of individual animals by sectioning hair along its growth trajectory. Isotopic signatures of great apes differed between sites, mainly as vegetation isotope baselines were correlated with site-specific climatic conditions. We show that controlling for plant isotopic characteristics at a given site is essential for faunal data interpretation. While accounting for plant baseline effects, we found distinct isotopic profiles for each great ape population. Based on evidence from habituated groups and sympatric great ape species, these differences could possibly be related to faunivory and folivory. Dietary flexibility in apes varied, but temporal variation was overall lower than in fossil hominins and extant baboons, shifting from C(3) to C(4)-resources, providing new perspectives on comparisons between extinct and extant primates.",S0047-2484(16)30130-0 [pii] and 10.1016/j.jhevol.2016.08.007 [doi],Carbon and Feeding ecology and Habitat and Isotopic baseline and Nitrogen and Seasonality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-seven remotely-located streams in Pennsylvania's Marcellus Shale basin were sampled during June and July of 2012 and 2013. At each stream, stream physiochemical properties, trophic biodiversity, and structure and mercury levels were assessed. We used δ15N, δ13C, and methyl mercury to determine whether changes in methyl mercury biomagnification were related to the fracking occurring within the streams' watersheds. While we observed no difference in rates of biomagnificaion related to within-watershed fracking activities, we did observe elevated methyl mercury concentrations that were influenced by decreased stream pH, elevated dissolved stream water Hg values, decreased macroinvertebrate Index for Biotic Integrity scores, and lower Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera macroinvertebrate richness at stream sites where fracking had occurred within their watershed. We documented the loss of scrapers from streams with the highest well densities, and no fish or no fish diversity at streams with documented frackwater fluid spills.

This effect is particularly evident on shores where organisms with aquatic larval stages enter the terrestrial food web. The identities of such trophic links are not easily estimated as spiders, a dominant group of shoreline predator, have external digestion. We compared trophic links and the prey diversity of spiders on different shore types along the Baltic Sea: on open shores and on shores with a reed belt bordering the water. A priori, we hypothesized that the physical structure of the shoreline reduces the flow between ecosystem and the subsidies across the sea-land interface. To circumvent the lack of morphologically detectable remains of spider prey, we used a combination of stable isotope and molecular gut content analyses. The two tools used for diet analysis revealed complementary information on spider diets. The stable isotope analysis indicated that spiders on open shores had a marine signal of carbon isotopes, while spiders on reedy shores had a terrestrial signal. The molecular analysis revealed a diverse array of dipteran and lepidopteran prey, where spiders on open and reedy shores shared a similar diet with a comparable proportion of chironomids, the larvae of which live in the marine system. Comparing the methods suggests that differences in isotope composition of the two spider groups occurred because of differences in the chironomid diets: as larvae, chironomids of reedy shores likely fed on terrestrial detritus and acquired a terrestrial isotope signature, while chironomids of open shores utilized an algal diet and acquired a marine isotope signature. Our results illustrate how different methods of diet reconstruction may shed light on complementary aspects of nutrient transfer. Overall, they reveal that reed belts can reduce connectivity between habitats, but also function as a source of food for predators.",ECE32536 [pii] and 10.1002/ece3.2536 [doi],Baltic Sea and DNA barcoding and Pardosa and chironomids and stable isotope analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is important to link these approaches to community analysis as the abundance and behaviour of species, populations or trophic groups can have a profound effect on nutrient budgets. METHODS: We determined the carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions of coral reef organic matter sources and macro-benthic invertebrate communities using a Europa Geo 20/20 isotope ratio mass spectrometer interfaced to an ANCA-SL elemental analyzer in continuous flow mode. Isotopic ecology metrics and a mixing model were used to analyze and interpret the data. RESULTS: The coral reef macro-invertebrate community principally relies on detrital or recycled food sources. An increased reliance on reef nitrogen-derived sources was observed in the cold-dry season. The community food-web lengths differ noticeably across the coral reef and reflect the characteristics and origin of organic matter reservoirs. CONCLUSIONS: Anthropogenic and terrestrial inputs lead to a loss of biological diversity. Exclusive dominance of suspension-feeding species is observed in areas receiving direct surface riverine particulate organic matter. The accumulation of sediment organic matter in eutrophic areas leads to dominance of deposit-feeding species. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",10.1002/rcm.7443 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thomas, Stephen M and Griffiths, Siân W and Ormerod, Steve J",2016,Beyond cool: adapting upland streams for climate change using riparian woodlands.,Global change biology,"Managed adaptation could reduce the risks of climate change to the world's ecosystems, but there have been surprisingly few practical evaluations of the options available. For example, riparian woodland is advocated widely as shade to reduce warming in temperate streams, but few studies have considered collateral effects on species composition or ecosystem functions. Here, we use cross-sectional analyses at two scales (region and within streams) to investigate whether four types of riparian management, including those proposed to reduce potential climate change impacts, might also affect the composition, functional character, dynamics and energetic resourcing of macroinvertebrates in upland Welsh streams (UK). Riparian land use across the region had only small effects on invertebrate taxonomic composition, while stable isotope data showed how energetic resources assimilated by macroinvertebrates in all functional guilds were split roughly 50:50 between terrestrial and aquatic origins irrespective of riparian management. Nevertheless, streams draining the most extensive deciduous woodland had the greatest stocks of coarse particulate matter (CPOM) and greater numbers of 'shredding' detritivores. Stream-scale investigations showed that macroinvertebrate biomass in deciduous woodland streams was around twice that in moorland streams, and lowest of all in streams draining non-native conifers. The unexpected absence of contrasting terrestrial signals in the isotopic data implies that factors other than local land use affect the relative incorporation of allochthonous subsidies into riverine food webs. Nevertheless, our results reveal how planting deciduous riparian trees along temperate headwaters as an adaptation to climate change can modify macroinvertebrate function, increase biomass and potentially enhance resilience by increasing basal resources where cover is extensive (>60 m riparian width). We advocate greater urgency in efforts to understand the ecosystem consequences of climate change adaptation to guide future actions.",10.1111/gcb.13103 [doi],adaptation and buffer strip and coarse particulate organic matter and isotope and macroinvertebrate and river and subsidy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sum PCB concentrations were highest for Main Basin (260 ± 24.9 ng g(-1) wet wt) fish, followed by Georgian Bay (74.6 ± 16.2 ng g(-1) ) and North Channel (42.0 ± 3.3 ng g(-1)) fish. Discriminant functions analysis of lake trout PCB profiles and stable carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) isotope values clearly distinguished fish by location, indicating high degrees of basin fidelity throughout their lifetimes in addition to highly contrasting PCB bioaccumulation profiles. These unique profiles were not attributable to significant differences in lake trout lipid contents (p = 0.856) or trophic position (δ(15)N; p = 0.334), with rainbow smelt representing the primary prey across the basins. Furthermore, significant differences were observed among the basins for the relationships between PCB biomagnification factors and hydrophobicity. An empirical model for predicting PCB biomagnification in Lake Huron lake trout indicated that basin-specific population growth rates and prey abundances were significant for explaining these contrasting patterns of PCB bioaccumulation. The results of the present study are fundamental for understanding the role of ecology in legacy persistent organic pollutant (POP) bioaccumulation. Specifically, ecosystem characteristics such as prey abundances, foraging ecology, and ultimately consumer growth can regulate the variability of legacy POP bioaccumulation as observed within and among a wide range of freshwater ecosystems.",10.1002/etc.3179 [doi],Basins and Lake Huron and Lake trout and Polychlorinated biphenyl and Prey abundance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although δ(13)C of both sources and consumers varied little between sampling sites and dates, δ(15)N spatial variability was higher and clearly reflected the organic enrichment in the second inlet as well as the uptake of anthropogenically derived material by benthic consumers. On the other hand, within the first inlet, the isotopic composition of consumers did not change in response to chemical contamination. However, the impact of polluted sediments near the Navy Arsenal in the first inlet was detectable at the level of the macrobenthic trophic structure, showing high dominance of motile, upper level consumers capable to face transient conditions and the reduction of the more resident deposit feeders.

The Mar Piccolo of Taranto is a densely populated area at a high risk of environmental crisis. Here, planktonic primary production (PP) and heterotrophic prokaryotic production (HPP) were measured as proxies of functioning in three sampling sites located in two inlets at different levels of industrial contamination, during three sampling surveys (June 2013, February and April 2014). To have a better overall view and provide some insights into the benthic-pelagic coupling, we integrated PP and HPP in the water column with those in the sediments and then discussed this with the origin of the organic matter pools based on analysis of stable isotopes. Heavy metals and polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) were also analysed in the surface (1 cm) sediment layer and related to the overall ecosystem functioning. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis, based on the main data, clearly separated the second inlet from the first one, more severely impacted by anthropogenic activities. The stable isotope mixing model suggested the prevalent terrestrial/riverine origin of the particulate organic matter pools (mean 45.5 %) in all sampling periods, whereas phytoplankton contributed up to 29 % in February. Planktonic PP and HPP rates followed the same pattern over the entire study period and seemed to respond to phytoplankton dynamics confirming this community as the main driver for the C cycling in the water column. On the contrary, benthic PP rates were almost negligible while HPP rates were lower or comparable to those in the water column indicating that although the Mar Piccolo is very shallow, the water column is much more productive than the surface sediments. The sediment resuspension is likely responsible for a pulsed input of contaminants into the water column.

River distance downstream of Columbus, Ohio - where study reaches were impounded and flow through a large urban center - was also implicated as an important factor.

In the present work, we developed an analytical method to quantify 20 free amino acids in aqueous soil extracts without derivatization. The method employed hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS) technique combined with a cation exchange solid phase extraction (SPE). Four stable isotope labelled amino acids were used as internal standards to improve the method performance. Good separation of 20 underivatized amino acids was achieved within 12min. The limit of detection (LODs) and limit of quantification (LOQs) were in the range of 13-384ngg(-1) and 43-1267ngg(-1) (dry soil basis), respectively.

"Fleming, Alyson H and Clark, Casey T and Calambokidis, John and Barlow, Jay",2016,Humpback whale diets respond to variance in ocean climate and ecosystem conditions in the California Current.,Global change biology,"Large, migratory predators are often cited as sentinel species for ecosystem processes and climate-related changes, but their utility as indicators is dependent upon an understanding of their response to environmental variability. Documentation of the links between climate variability, ecosystem change and predator dynamics is absent for most top predators. Identifying species that may be useful indicators and elucidating these mechanistic links provides insight into current ecological dynamics and may inform predictions of future ecosystem responses to climatic change. We examine humpback whale response to environmental variability through stable isotope analysis of diet over a dynamic 20-year period (1993-2012) in the California Current System (CCS). Humpback whale diets captured two major shifts in oceanographic and ecological conditions in the CCS. Isotopic signatures reflect a diet dominated by krill during periods characterized by positive phases of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), cool sea surface temperature (SST), strong upwelling and high krill biomass. In contrast, humpback whale diets are dominated by schooling fish when the NPGO is negative, SST is warmer, seasonal upwelling is delayed and anchovy and sardine populations display increased biomass and range expansion. These findings demonstrate that humpback whales trophically respond to ecosystem shifts, and as a result, their foraging behavior is a synoptic indicator of oceanographic and ecological conditions across the CCS. Multi-decadal examination of these sentinel species thus provides insight into biological consequences of interannual climate fluctuations, fundamental to advancing ecosystem predictions related to global climate change.",10.1111/gcb.13171 [doi],North Pacific Gyre Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation and cetacean foraging and climate change and ecosystem shifts and euphausiids and forage fish and upwelling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We use the stable carbon isotopic composition (δ(13)C) of bison and mammoth tissues as a proxy for the relative abundance of C3 and C4 vegetation in their grazing habitat to determine climatic and atmospheric CO2 controls on C4 grass distributions from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the present. We predict the spatial variability of grass δ(13)C in North America using a mean of three different methods of classification and regression tree (CART) machine learning techniques and nine climatic variables. We show that growing season precipitation and temperature are the strongest predictors of all single climate variables. We apply this CART analysis to high-resolution gridded climate data and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) mean paleoclimate model outputs to produce predictive isotope landscape models (""isoscapes"") for the current, mid-Holocene, and LGM average δ(13)C of grass-dominated areas across North America. From the LGM to the present, C4 grass abundances substantially increased in the Great Plains despite concurrent increases in atmospheric CO2.

However, little is known on the effects of allochthonous subsidies on food web structure and trophic niche dimensions of consumers in the tropics. We excluded allochthonous aquatic insects from tropical streams using greenhouse-type exclosures to test the influence of aquatic allochthonous subsidies on the trophic structure and niche dimensions of terrestrial predators using stable isotope methods. In exclosure treatments, abundance and biomass of terrestrial predators, and biomass of phytophages decreased and increased, respectively. Vegetation-living predators were more responsive to allochthonous inputs than those living on the ground. Overall, lower availability of allochthonous inputs did not affect community-wide metrics and niche width of predators. However, the niche width of some spider families had very low overlap between treatments, and others had wider isotopic niches in the control than in the exclusion treatment. Most of the C and N in predators living in control stretches came from aquatic subsidies, and those predators living in the exclusion treatments switched their diets to terrestrial sources, showing a preference of predators for allochthonous subsidies. Our results suggest that allochthonous subsidies are also relevant to tropical fauna living upon vegetation. Moreover, allochthonous resources may amplify the niche dimension of certain predators or considerably change the trophic niche of others. Our study highlights the importance of including modern isotopic tools in elucidating the role of allochthonous resources on the patterns of trophic structure and niche dimensions of consumers from donor ecosystems.",10.1111/1365-2656.12475 [doi],Bayesian mixing models and SIAR and community-wide metrics and ecosystem boundaries and flux across ecosystems and food web structure and trophic niche dimension and tropical riparian forest and water-land interfaces and δ13C-δ15N biplots,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cause of dietary variation within species is commonly an ontogenetic niche shift, which is a key dynamic influencing community structure. We quantified spatial and temporal variations in ringed seal (Pusa hispida) diet, niche size, and TP during ontogeny across the Arctic-a rapidly changing ecosystem. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis was performed on 558 liver and 630 muscle samples from ringed seals and on likely prey species from five locations ranging from the High to the Low Arctic. A modest ontogenetic diet shift occurred, with adult ringed seals consuming more forage fish (approximately 80 versus 60 %) and having a higher TP than subadults, which generally decreased with latitude. However, the degree of shift varied spatially, with adults in the High Arctic presenting a more restricted niche size and consuming more Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) than subadults (87 versus 44 %) and adults at the lowest latitude (29 %). The TPs of adult and subadult ringed seals generally decreased with latitude (4.7-3.3), which was mainly driven by greater complexity in trophic structure within the zooplankton communities. Adult isotopic niche size increased over time, likely due to the recent circumpolar increases in subarctic forage fish distribution and abundance. Given the spatial and temporal variability in ringed seal foraging ecology, ringed seals exhibit dietary plasticity as a species, suggesting adaptability in terms of their diet to climate change.",10.1007/s00442-015-3384-5 [pii] and 10.1007/s00442-015-3384-5 [doi],Arctic and Ontogenetic niche shift and Ringed seal and Stable isotopes and Trophic position,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, subsidies between linked habitats, such as streams and riparian zones, create potential for competition between populations which never directly interact. Evidence suggests that the abundance of riparian consumers declines after fish invasion and a subsequent increase in resource sharing of emerging insects. However, diet overlap has not been investigated. Here, we examine the trophic niche of native fish, invasive fish, and native spiders in South Africa using stable isotope analysis. We compared spider abundance and diet at upstream fishless and downstream fish sites and quantified niche overlap with invasive and native fish. Spider abundance was consistently higher at upstream fishless sites compared with paired downstream fish sites, suggesting that the fish reduced aquatic resource availability to riparian consumers. Spiders incorporated more aquatic than terrestrial insects in their diet, with aquatic insects accounting for 45-90% of spider mass. In three of four invaded trout rivers, we found that the average proportion of aquatic resources in web-building spider diet was higher at fishless sites compared to fish sites. The probability of web-building and ground spiders overlapping into the trophic niche of invasive brown and rainbow trout was as high as 26 and 51%, respectively. In contrast, the probability of spiders overlapping into the trophic niche of native fish was always less than 5%. Our results suggest that spiders share resources with invasive fish. In contrast, spiders had a low probability of trophic overlap with native fish indicating that the traits of invaders may be important in determining their influence on ecosystem subsidies. We have added to the growing body of evidence that invaders can have cross-ecosystem impacts and demonstrated that this can be due to niche overlap.",ECE31893 [pii] and 10.1002/ece3.1893 [doi],Competition and invasive species and niche overlap and nicheROVER and stable isotope and trophic subsidies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The micro-organisms in pumped water from the actively mined areas, as well as, pre- and post-mining formation waters were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The methane stable isotope composition of Bowen Basin coal seam indicates that methanogenesis has occurred in the geological past. More recently at the mine site, changing groundwater flow dynamics and the introduction of oxygen in the subsurface has increased microbial biomass and diversity. Consistent with microbial communities found in other coal seam environments, pumped coal mine waters from the subsurface were dominated by bacteria belonging to the genera Pseudomonas and the family Rhodocyclaceae. These environments and bacterial communities supported a methanogen population, including Methanobacteriaceae, Methanococcaceae and Methanosaeta. However, one of the most ubiquitous micro-organisms in anoxic coal mine waters belonged to the family 'Candidatus Methanoperedenaceae'. As the Archaeal family 'Candidatus Methanoperedenaceae' has not been extensively defined, the one studied species in the family is capable of anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to nitrate reduction. This introduces the possibility that a methane cycle between archaeal methanogenesis and methanotrophy may exist in the anoxic waters of the coal seam after hydrogeological disturbance.",10.1111/gbi.12166 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the effects of deforestation and subsequent afforestation of a riparian forest of Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) on stable isotope ratios of carbon (δ¹³C) and nitrogen (δ¹⁵N) and natural abundances of radiocarbon (Δ¹⁴C) in stream biota in the Mt. Gomadan Experimental Forest and the Wakayama Forest Research Station, Kyoto University, central Japan. Macroinvertebrates, periphytic algae attached to rock surfaces (periphyton), and leaf litter of terrestrial plants were collected from six headwater streams with similar climate, topography, and bedrock geology, except for the stand ages of riparian forests (from 3 to 49 yr old in five stands and > 90 yr old in one reference stand). Light intensity and δ¹³C values of both periphyton and macroinvertebrates decreased synchronously with forest age in winter. A Bayesian mixing model indicates that periphyton contributions to the stream food webs are maximized in 23-yr-old forests. Except for grazers, most macroinvertebrates showed Δ¹⁴C values similar to those of terrestrial leaf litter, reflecting the influence of modern atmospheric CO₂ Δ¹⁴C values. On the other hand, the Δ¹⁴C values of both periphyton and grazers (i.e., aquatic primary consumers) were significantly lower than that of modern atmospheric CO₂, and were lowest in 23-yr-old forest stands. Previous studies show that root biomass of C. japonica peaks at 15-30 yr after planting. These evidences suggest that soil CO₂ released by root respiration and dispersed by groundwater weathers carbonate substrata, and that dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) with low Δ¹⁴C is incorporated into stream periphyton and some macroinvertebrates. The ecological response in the studied streams to clear-cutting and replanting of Japanese cedar is much slower (~20 yr) than the chemical response (< 5 yr). More than 50 yr is required for the food web structure to completely recover from clear-cutting. The ecological delay is attributed to several biogeochemical factors, the understanding of which is critical to integrated management of forest-stream continuum and the prediction of ecosystem resilience in response to environmental change.",10.1890/15-1133.1 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, interrelationships between water availability and plant use on short timescales are difficult to quantify and remain poorly understood. To overcome previous methodological limitations, we coupled high-resolution in situ observations of stable isotopes in soil and transpiration water. We applied the approach along with Bayesian mixing modeling to track the fate of (2) H-labeled rain pulses following drought through soil and plants of deciduous tree ecosystems. We resolve how rainwater infiltrates the root zones in a nonequilibrium process and show that tree species differ in their ability to quickly acquire the newly available source. Sessile oak (Quercus petraea) adjusted root uptake to vertical water availability patterns under drought, but readjustment toward the rewetted topsoil was delayed. By contrast, European beech (Fagus sylvatica) readily utilized water from all soil depths independent of water depletion, enabling faster uptake of rainwater.

Metals (Hg, Se, Tl, and Fe) were measured in char tissues to determine their relationships with health indices (relative condition factor and hepatosomatic index), stable nitrogen isotope ratios, and liver histology. A subcellular partitioning procedure was employed to determine how metals were distributed between potentially sensitive and detoxified compartments of Arctic char livers from a low- and high-mercury lake (Small Lake and Amituk Lake, respectively). Differences in health indices and metal concentrations among char populations were likely related to differences in feeding ecology. Concentrations of Hg, Se, and Tl were highest in the livers of Amituk char, whereas concentrations of Fe were highest in Small and 9-Mile char. At the subcellular level we found that although Amituk char had higher concentrations of Tl in whole liver than Small Lake char, they maintained a greater proportion of this metal in detoxified fractions, suggesting an attempt at detoxification. Mercury was found mainly in potentially sensitive fractions of both Small and Amituk Lake char, indicating that Arctic char are not effectively detoxifying this metal.

Body size is often positively correlated with species traits such as metabolism, prey size and trophic position (TP) due to physiological and mechanical constraints. We used stable isotope analysis to quantify TP among minnows across multiple assemblages that differed in their species composition, diversity and food web structure. Body size significantly predicted TP across different lineages and assemblages, and indicated a significant negative relationship. The observed negative relationship between body size and TP is contrary to conventional knowledge, and is likely to have arisen owing to highly clade-specific patterns, such that clades consist of either large benthic species or small pelagic species. Cyprinids probably subvert the physiological and mechanical constraints that generally produce a positive relationship between body size and TP using anatomical modifications and by consuming small-bodied prey, respectively. The need for herbivorous cyprinids to digest cellulose-rich foods probably selected for larger bodies to accommodate longer intestinal tracts and thereby to facilitate digestion of nutrient-poor resources, such as algae. Therefore, body size and TP are likely to have coevolved in cyprinids in association with specialization along the benthic to pelagic resource axis.",rsos150652 [pii] and 10.1098/rsos.150652 [doi],Cyprinidae and benthic–pelagic axis and coevolution and community structure and diet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heat waves and diet shifts in tadpoles.,Ecology,"Temperature can play an important role in determining the feeding preferences of ectotherms. In light of the warmer temperatures arising with the current climatic changes, omnivorous ectotherms may perform diet shifts toward higher herbivory to optimize energetic intake. Such diet shifts may also occur during heat waves, which are projected to become more frequent, intense, and longer lasting in the future. Here, we investigated how heat waves of different duration affect feeding preferences in omnivorous anuran tadpoles and how these choices affect larval life history. In laboratory experiments, we fed tadpoles of three species on animal, plant, or mixed diet and exposed them to short heat waves (similar to the heat waves these species experience currently) or long heat waves (predicted to increase under climate change). We estimated the dietary choices of tadpoles fed on the mixed diet using stable isotopes and recorded tadpole survival and growth, larval period, and mass at metamorphosis. Tadpole feeding preferences were associated with their thermal background, with herbivory increasing with breeding temperature in nature. Patterns in survival, growth, and development generally support decreased efficiency of carnivorous diets and increased efficiency or higher relative quality of herbivorous diets at higher temperatures. All three species increased herbivory in at least one of the heat wave treatments, but the responses varied among species. Diet shifts toward higher herbivory were maladaptive in one species, but beneficial in the other two. Higher herbivory in omnivorous ectotherms under warmer temperatures may impact species differently and further contribute to changes in the structure and function of freshwater environments.",10.1002/ecy.1541 [doi],Discoglossus galganoi and Hyla arborea and Hyla meridionalis and Amphibian and carnivory and climate change and diet regulation and herbivory and omnivory and stable isotope mixing models,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Particularly in great apes, researchers can sample long hair completely non-invasively from nests, allowing the investigation of inter- and intra-individual dietary variation. Given its incremental growth pattern, hair records temporal shifts in diet over long periods and allows one to reconstruct seasonal dietary patterns in species that cannot be directly observed. However, as for other sample materials, there are potential drawbacks related to the properties of hair keratin. Here I review some important facts on the nature of primate hair and also introduce new isotopic data from infant bonobo hair to provide methodological recommendations for future sample collection in the field and sample preparation in the laboratory. While these methodological guidelines focus on great apes which can be sampled strictly non-invasively, I also consider applications to other free-ranging primates. The biochemical composition, growth cycle, isotope turnover rate and isotopic fractionation in hair keratin are particularly relevant for data analysis and interpretation. Also, one can microscopically identify infant hairs and analyze them separately to study nursing and weaning behavior in primates. The goal of this article is to encourage primatologists to analyze the stable isotope ratios of hair to assess primate feeding ecology. Am. J.

Elevated Cd concentrations in moose (Alces americanus) kidney have been observed in the region and are a health care concern for consumers of traditional foods. This study examined the factors associated with, and potential renal effects from, the accumulation of cadmium, and interactions with other elements in four sympatric ungulate species. Mean renal Cd concentration was highest in moose (48.3mg/kg ww), followed by mountain caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) (13.9mg/kg ww) and mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) (5.78mg/kg ww). No local sources of Cd were evident and the elevated levels in moose are considered to be natural in origin. Conversely, total Hg concentration was significantly higher in mountain caribou kidney (0.21mg/kg ww) than in moose (0.011mg/kg ww).

The levels of both nuclides are low and the risk to the animals and people consuming them is negligible. Stable isotope δ(15)N and δ(13)C signatures in muscle showed a separation between the mountain caribou, with a lichen-dominated diet, and moose, which browse shrubs and forbs. Isotope signatures for mountain goat and Dall's sheep showed generalist feeding patterns. Differences in elemental and radionuclide levels between species were attributed to relative levels of metal accumulation in the different food items in the diets of the respective species. Kidneys from each species showed minor histological changes in the proximal tubule and glomerulus, although glomerular changes were rare and all changes were rare in mountain goat kidney. Kidney function was not expected to be affected in any species.

Studies of chipmunks (Tamias spp.) in Yosemite National Park provide an important opportunity to explore the reasons for this variation in response. While the alpine chipmunk (T. alpinus) has undergone a significant elevational range contraction over the past century, the congeneric and partially sympatric lodgepole chipmunk (T. speciosus) has not experienced an elevational range shift during this period. As a first step toward identifying the factors underlying this difference in response, we examined evidence for dietary changes and changes in cranial morphology in these species over the past century. Stable isotope analyses of fur samples from modern and historical museum specimens of these species collected at the same localities indicated that signatures of dietary change were more pronounced in T. alpinus, although diet breadth did not differ consistently between the study species. Morphometric analyses of crania from these specimens revealed significant changes in cranial shape for T. alpinus, with less pronounced changes in shape for T. speciosus; evidence of selection on skull morphology was detected for T. alpinus, but not for T. speciosus. These results are consistent with growing evidence that T. alpinus is generally more responsive to environmental change than T. speciosus, but emphasize the complex and often geographically variable nature of such responses.

In addition, the convex hull area of the two types of conditions has been calculated as a proxy for the total extent of trophic diversity within each food web. Results have shown that the trophic niche width is at least 1.4 times wider in invaded conditions than in non-invaded conditions. In addition, this study gives further evidence of similar feeding analogies between the invasive herbivore fish, Siganus luridus and native herbivore fish Sparisoma cretense as both are feeding at the same isotopic level. This investigation provides with new scientific data to assess bionvasions in invaded and non-invaded conditions at assemblage level in coastal systems.",S0141-1136(16)30128-3 [pii] and 10.1016/j.marenvres.2016.07.010 [doi],Food web and Invasive alien species and Lessepsian and Mediterranean and Stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the past two decades, much research has been devoted to examining the influence of warming on SOM decomposition in topsoil. Most SOM, however, is old and stored in subsoil. The fate of subsoil SOM under future warming remains highly uncertain. Here, by combining a long-term field warming experiment and a meta-analysis study, we showed that warming significantly increased SOM decomposition in subsoil. We also showed that a decade of warming promoted decomposition of subsoil SOM with turnover times of decades to millennia in a tall grass prairie and this effect was largely associated with shifts in the functional gene structure of microbial communities. By coupling stable isotope probing with metagenomics, we found that microbial communities in warmed soils possessed a higher relative abundance of key functional genes involved in the degradation of organic materials with varying recalcitrance than those in control soils. These findings suggest warming may considerably alter the stability of the vast pool of old SOM in subsoil, contributing to the long-term positive feedback between the C cycle and climate.",ismej201748 [pii] and 10.1038/ismej.2017.48 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This assessment is an important first step in quantifying food-web structure in a region subject to intense fishing activities. Nearshore food webs were driven by at least two isotopically distinct trophic pathways, algal and seagrass, with a greater proportion of the sampled species feeding within the seagrass food web (57%) compared with the algal food web (33%). There was considerable isotopic niche overlap among species (92% of species overlapped with at least one other species). Narrow isotopic niche widths of most (83%) species sampled, low isotopic similarity (only 23% of species exhibited no differences in δ(13) C and δ(15) N) and low predicted trophic redundancy among fishes most commonly caught by fishermen (15%), however, suggest that adjustments to resource management concerning harvesting and gear selectivity may be needed for the persistence of artisanal fishing in northern Tanzania.

Isotopic composition of sharks sampled in reef and seagrass habitats (Shark Bay, GBR) reflected seagrass-based food-webs, whereas at Ningaloo Reef analysis revealed a dietary transition between pelagic and seagrass food-webs.

Tiger sharks occupied roles at the top of food-webs at Shark Bay and on the GBR, but not at Ningaloo Reef or off the coast of NSW. Composition of δ(13)C in tissues was influenced by body size and sex of sharks, in addition to residency and diet stability. This variability in stable isotopic composition of tissues is likely to be a result of adaptive foraging strategies that allow these sharks to exploit multiple shelf and offshore habitats.

Knowledge of plant water uptake pattern is indispensable for understanding soil-plant interactions and species coexistence. The 'Grain for Green' project that started in 1999 in the Loess Plateau of China has led to large scale vegetation change. However, little is known about the water uptake patterns of the main plant species that inhabit in this region. In this study, the seasonal variations in water uptake patterns of three representative plant species, Stipa bungeana, Artemisia gmelinii and Vitex negundo, that are widely distributed in the semi-arid area of the Loess Plateau, were identified by using dual stable isotopes of δ(2)H and δ(18)O in plant and soil water coupled with a Bayesian mixing model MixSIAR. The soil water at the 0-120cm depth contributed 79.54±6.05% and 79.94±8.81% of the total water uptake of S. bungeana and A. gmelinii, respectively, in the growing season. The 0-40cm soil contributed the most water in July (74.20±15.20%), and the largest proportion of water (33.10±15.20%) was derived from 120-300cm soils in August for A. gmelinii. However, V. negundo obtained water predominantly from surface soil horizons (0-40cm) and then switched to deep soil layers (120-300cm) as the season progressed. This suggested that V. negundo has a greater degree of ecological plasticity as it could explore water sources from deeper soils as the water stress increased. This capacity can mainly be attributed to its functionally dimorphic root system. V. negundo may have a competitive advantage when encountering short-term drought. The ecological plasticity of plant water use needs to be considered in plant species selection and ecological management and restoration of the arid and semi-arid ecosystems in the Loess Plateau.",S0048-9697(17)31836-3 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.07.133 [doi],Dual stable isotopes and Loess Plateau and MixSIAR and Root distribution and Water uptake pattern,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this, stem growth rates were similar to today. Using a coupled light-use efficiency and tree growth model, we show that it is possible to maintain a stable c(i)/c(a) ratio because both vapour pressure deficit and temperature were decreased under glacial conditions at La Brea, and these have compensating effects on the c(i)/c(a) ratio. Reduced photorespiration at lower temperatures would partly mitigate the effect of low c(i) on gross primary production, but maintenance of present-day radial growth also requires a ~27% reduction in the ratio of fine root mass to leaf area. Such a shift was possible due to reduced drought stress under glacial conditions at La Brea. The necessity for changes in allocation in response to changes in [CO(2)] is consistent with increased below-ground allocation, and the apparent homoeostasis of radial growth, as c(a) increases today.",srep43087 [pii] and 10.1038/srep43087 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction of wheat and barley as well as the addition of domesticated herbivores during the Late Neolithic (∼2600-1900 BC) led to restructuring of ancient Chinese subsistence strategies. This study documents a dietary shift from indigenous millets to the newly introduced cereals in northcentral China during the Bronze Age Eastern Zhou Dynasty (771-221 BC) based on stable isotope analysis of human and animal bone samples. Our results show that this change affected females to a greater degree than males. We find that consumption of the newly introduced cereals was associated with less consumption of animal products and a higher rate of skeletal stress markers among females. We hypothesized that the observed separation of dietary signatures between males and females marks the rise of male-biased inequality in early China. We test this hypothesis by comparing Eastern Zhou human skeletal data with those from Neolithic Yangshao archaeological contexts. We find no evidence of male-female inequality in early farming communities. The presence of male-biased inequality in Eastern Zhou society is supported by increased body height difference between the sexes as well as the greater wealth of male burials.",1611742114 [pii] and 201611742 [pii] and 10.1073/pnas.1611742114 [doi],East Asia and Yangshao and bioarchaeology and paleo diet and stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This omnivorous configuration occurs frequently in food webs, but theory suggests that it is unstable unless stabilizing mechanisms exist that can decrease the strength of the omnivore and consumer interaction. Although these mechanisms have been documented in native food webs, little is known about whether they operate in the context of an introduced species. Here, we study a marine mussel aquaculture system where the introduction of omnivorous mussels should generate an unstable food web that favors the extinction of the consumer, yet it persists. Using field and laboratory approaches, we searched for stabilizing mechanisms that could reduce interaction strengths in the food web. While field zooplankton counts suggested that mussels influence the composition and abundance of copepods, stable isotope results indicated that life-history omnivory and cannibalism facilitated the availability of prey refugia, and reduced competition and the interaction strength between the mussel omnivore and zooplankton consumers. In laboratory experiments, however, we found no evidence of adaptive feeding which could weaken predator-consumer interactions. Our food web study suggests that the impact of an introduced omnivore may not only depend on its interaction with native species but also on the availability of stabilizing mechanisms that alter the strength of those interactions.",ECE32773 [pii] and 10.1002/ece3.2773 [doi],adaptive feeding and intraguild predation and invasive species and ontogenetic niche shift and prey size refugia and stage structure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is poorly understood to what extent different mercury (Hg) pools contribute to existent MMHg levels. In this study, ambient concentrations of total Hg (THg) and MMHg as well as rates of methylation and demethylation were measured simultaneously in sediments with and without salt-marsh plant vegetation, which were collected in Guadiana and Tagus estuaries, Portugal. Concurrent processes of Hg methylation and MMHg demethylation were directly monitored and compared by spiking sediments cores with stable isotope tracers of (199)Hg(2+) and CH(3)(201)Hg(+) followed by gas chromatographic separation and isotope-specific detection using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Compared to the Guadiana estuary, where concentrations were comparatively low, THg and MMHg levels varied between vegetated and non-vegetated sediments collected at the Rosário site (ROS) of the Tagus estuary. Methylation (K(M)) and demethylation rates (K(D)) were also different between estuaries being dependent on the presence of vegetation. In addition, the type of macrophyte species influenced K(M) and K(D) values. In fact, the highest K(M) value was found in Sarcocornia fruticosa vegetated sediments at the Castro Marim site in Guadiana (CM, 0.160 day(-1)) and the lowest K(M) was observed in non-vegetated sediments at the Alcochete site in Tagus (ALC, 0.009 day(-1)). K(D) varied by a factor of three among sites with highest rates of demethylation observed in non-vegetated sediments in Guadiana (12 ± 1.3 day(-1), corresponding to a half-life of 1.4 ± 0.2 h).

IsoSource model was adopted to calculate the contribution of potential carbon sources to the consumers. Biospeciemens collected in the summer of 2014 were compared with those in the spring of 2015, aiming to analyze the seasonal variation in the trophic structure of food web. Six quantitative community indices were calculated based on the isotope values of the organisms in Haizhou Bay.

They have caused significant changes in the many freshwater systems they have invaded by increasing water clarity, reducing primary productivity, and altering zooplankton and benthic invertebrate assemblages. What is less clear is how their ecosystem engineering effects manifest up the food web to impact higher trophic levels, including fish. Here, we use a biological tracer (stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen) to analyze long-term and broad-scale trends in the resource use of benthivorous lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) in the Laurentian Great Lakes, where dreissenid mussels have become established in each lake except Lake Superior. We measured stable isotope ratios from archived material (fish scale samples) collected over several decades by multiple agencies and from 14 locations around the Great Lakes. In the majority of locations, the δ(13) C of lake whitefish increased following the establishment of dreissenid mussels. Trends in δ(15) N were less clear, but significant breakpoints in the time series occurred within 5 yr of dreissenid establishment in several locations, followed by declines in δ(15) N. In contrast, isotopic signatures in Lake Superior locations did not show these trends. Our results provide evidence that lake whitefish shifted toward greater reliance on nearshore benthic production, supporting the theory that fundamental energy pathways are changed when dreissenid mussels become established. Importantly, these effects were noted across multiple, large, and complex ecosystems spanning a broad geographic area. Our study underscores the potential for aquatic invasive species to alter key ecosystem services as demonstrated here through their impacts on energy pathways supporting a commercially harvested fish species.",10.1002/ecy.1836 [doi],Coregonidae and aquatic invasive species and benthic-pelagic coupling and benthification and mid-depth sink and nearshore phosphorus shunt and regime shift,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Co-occurrence led to isotopic niche partitioning among sharks within nurseries, with significant increases in δ(15)N values among sicklefin lemon sharks, and significant decreases in δ(15)N among blacktip reef sharks. Niche segregation likely promotes coexistence of these two predators during early years of growth and development, but data do not suggest coexistence affects life history traits, such as body size, body condition, and ontogenetic niche shifts.

Stable carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) isotope values provide useful information into the study of animal ecology and evolution, since the isotope ratios of consumers reflect consumer's dietary patterns. Nevertheless, the lack of species- and element-specific laboratory-derived turnover rates could limit their application. Using a laboratory-based dual stable isotope tracer approach (Na(15) NO (3) and NaH(13) CO (3)), we evaluated the δ(15)N and δ(13)C isotope turnover rates in full-grown adult invasive Limnomysis benedeni from Lake Constance. We provide δ(15)N and δ(13)C turnover rates based on nonlinear least-squares regression and posterior linear regression models. Model precisions and fit were evaluated using Akaike's information criterion. Within a couple of days, the δ(15)N and δ(13)C of mysids began to change. Nevertheless, after about 14 days, L. benedeni did not reach equilibrium with their new isotope values. Since the experiment was conducted on adult subjects, it is evident that turnover was mainly influenced by metabolism (in contrast to growth). Unlike traditional dietary shifts, our laboratory-based dual stable isotope tracer approach does not shift the experimental organisms into a new diet and avoids dietary effects on isotope values. Results confirm the application of isotopic tracers to label mysid subpopulations and could be used to reflect assimilation and turnover from the labeled dietary sources. Field-based stable isotope studies often use isotopic mixing models commonly assuming diet-tissue steady state. Unfortunately, in cases where the isotopic composition of the animal is not in equilibrium with its diet, this can lead to highly misleading conclusions. Thus, our laboratory-based isotopic incorporation rates assist interpretation of the isotopic values from the field and provide a foundation for future research into using isotopic tracers to investigate invasion ecology.",ECE32928 [pii] and 10.1002/ece3.2928 [doi],Na15NO3 and NaH13CO3 and stable isotope and δ13C and δ15N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We combine natural stable isotope methods with qPCR to investigate how denitrifier gene abundance is related to variations in nitrate (NO(3)(-)) pool sizes across diverse terrestrial biomes and conditions. We analyze NO(3)(-) isotope composition ((15)N/(14)N, (18)O/(16)O) and denitrifier gene nirS in 52 soil samples from different California ecosystems, spanning desert, chaparral, oak-woodland/savanna and forest. δ(15)N-NO(3)(-) correlates positively with δ(18)O-NO(3)(-) (P⩽0.03) and nirS abundance (P=0.00002) across sites, revealing the widespread importance of isotopic discrimination by soil denitrifiers. Furthermore, NO(3)(-) concentrations correlate negatively to nirS (P=0.002) and δ(15)N-NO(3)(-) (P=0.003) across sites. We also observe these spatial relationships in short-term (7-day), in situ soil-incubation experiments; NO(3)(-)-depletion strongly corresponds with increased nirS, nirS/16 rRNA, and enrichment of heavy NO(3)(-) isotopes over time. Overall, these findings suggest that microbial denitrification can consume plant-available NO(3)(-) to low levels at multiple time scales, contributing to N-limitation patterns across sites, particularly in moist, carbon-rich soils. Furthermore, our study provides a new approach for understanding the relationships between microbial gene abundance and terrestrial ecosystem functioning.",ismej2016147 [pii] and 10.1038/ismej.2016.147 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fisheries, climate change and elevated nutrient inputs are variously blamed, at least in part, for altering oceanic ecosystems. Yet it is challenging to assess the extent of anthropogenic change in the open oceans, where historical records of ecological conditions are sparse, and the geographical scale is immense. We developed millennial-scale amino acid nitrogen isotope records preserved in ancient animal remains to understand changes in food web structure and nutrient regimes in the oceanic realm of the North Pacific Ocean (NPO). Our millennial-scale isotope records of amino acids in bone collagen in a wide-ranging oceanic seabird, the Hawaiian petrel (Pterodroma sandwichensis), showed that trophic level declined over time. The amino acid records do not support a broad-scale increase in nitrogen fixation in the North Pacific subtropical gyre, rejecting an earlier interpretation based on bulk and amino acid specific δ(15)N chronologies for Hawaiian deep-sea corals and bulk δ(15)N chronologies for the Hawaiian petrel.

Few studies have examined the influence of diet on FR profiles in nestling raptors and the possible physiological implications of such FR exposure. The objectives of this research were (1) to determine spatial patterns of ≤ 48 polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners and ≤ 26 non-PBDE FRs, including organophosphate esters (OPEs), in nestling peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) across the Canadian Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin (GL-SLR; 2010) and in the eastern Canadian Arctic (2007); (2) to identify temporal changes in FR concentrations from the mid-2000s to 2010 in GL-SLR peregrine nestlings; (3) to investigate the role of diet using stable isotopes on exposure patterns of quantifiable FRs; and (4) to assess possible associations between circulating FRs and total (T) thyroxine (TT(4)) and triiodothyronine (TT(3)), tocopherol, retinol and oxidative status (isoprostanes). The summed concentrations of the top 5 PBDEs (Σ(5)) (BDE-47, -99, -100, -154, -153) were significantly higher in rural nestlings than urban nestlings in the GL-SLR, followed by the eastern Arctic nestlings. The PBDE congener profile of rural nestlings was dominated by BDE-99 (34‰), whereas BDE-209 (31‰) became dominant in the 2010 urban PBDE profile marking a shift since the mid-2000s. Low (ppb) concentrations of 25 novel non-PBDE FRs (e.g., 1,2-bis-(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane (BTBPE), decabromodiphenylethane (DBDPE)) were measured in the nestlings in at least one region, with the first report in peregrines of 15 novel non-PBDE FRs (e.g., 2-ethyl-1-hyxyl 2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoate (EHTBB), pentabromo allyl ether (PBPAE), tetrabromoethylcyclohexane (α-, β-DBE-DBCH)) as well as of tris (2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) (0-7.5ng/g ww) > tris(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP) (0.1-5.5ng/g ww) > tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) (0.02-2.0ng/g ww) > tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) (0-1.0ng/g ww). Within the GL-SLR, the urban nestlings' diet had significantly more terrestrial sources (greater δ(13)C values) than the broader, more aquatic-based diet of rural peregrines. Dietary source (δ(13)C) was significantly associated with concentrations of Σ(5)PBDE, BDE-209, EHTBB, and 2,2-4,4',5,5'-hexabromobiphenyl (BB-153), with trophic level (δ(15)N) also positively associated with BDE-209 levels.

Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) has the potential to reduce the accumulation of organic wastes in the environment by using taxa of lower trophic levels such as filter feeders. However, the capacity of filter feeders to assimilate significant quantities of fish farm wastes has not yet been fully tested in situ. We analyzed the stable isotopes δ(13)C and δ(15)N in mussels from six fish farms and from six other areas that were not influenced by fish farming, at two water strata (surface and mid-water) across a marked gradient of eutrophication along more than 900 km of coastline in the Western Mediterranean. We found that the mussels did not directly assimilate fish farming wastes. Consequently, fish farming wastes did not constitute a major component of mussel diet, irrespective of local productivity and depth in the water column. These outcomes do not necessarily mean that IMTA is not suitable in other cases, but rather that there should be a shift in the rationale of IMTA by modifying the concept of direct assimilation of wastes to a more general approach of IMTA based on regional budgets of nutrients.",S0301-4797(17)30611-4 [pii] and 10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.06.029 [doi],Coastal pollution and Fish farming and IMTA and Mediterranean and Mytilus galloprovincialis and Stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We next conducted an investigation of the physiological characteristics of selected natural variants with high and low WUE to understand how these characteristics translate to differences in WUE. We identified an interesting Spring accession, G302 (Mozart), that exhibited the highest WUE in the field and high CO2 assimilation rates coupled with an increased electron transport capacity (Jmax) under the imposed conditions. Differences in stomatal density and stomatal index did not translate to differences in stomatal conductance in the investigated accessions. Stomatal conductance response to exogenous ABA was analyzed in selected high and low WUE accessions. Spring lines showed little variation in response to exogenous ABA, while one Semi-Winter line (SW047) showed a significantly more rapid response to exogenous ABA, that corresponded to the high WUE indicated by δ13C measurements.

Identifying the potential links between populations is one of the key tools that can improve the current management across fisheries areas. In addition to characterising populations' contamination state, chemical compounds can help refine foraging areas, individual flows and populations' structure, especially when combined with other intrinsic biogeochemical (trophic) markers such as carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes. This study investigated the bioaccumulation of seven selected trace metals - chromium, nickel, copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg) and lead - in the muscle of 443 albacore tunas, collected over two seasons and/or years in the western Indian Ocean (WIO: Reunion Island and Seychelles) and in the south-eastern Atlantic Ocean (SEAO: South Africa). The main factor that explained metal concentration variability was the geographic origin of fish, rather than the size and the sex of individuals, or the season/year of sampling. The elements Cu, Zn, Cd and Hg indicated a segregation of the geographic groups most clearly. For similar sized-individuals, tunas from SEAO had significantly higher concentrations in Cu, Zn and Cd, but lower Hg concentrations than those from WIO. Information inferred from the analysis of trophic markers (δ(13)C, δ(15)N) and selected persistent organic pollutants, as well as information on stomach contents, corroborated the geographical differences obtained by trace metals. It also highlighted the influence of trophic ecology on metal bioaccumulation. Finally, this study evidenced the potential of metals and chemical contaminants in general as tracers, by segregating groups of individuals using different food webs or habitats, to better understand spatial connectivity at the population scale. Limited flows of individuals between the SEAO and the WIO are suggested.

Processes & impacts,"Terrestrial runoff represents a major source of mercury (Hg) to aquatic ecosystems. In boreal forest catchments, such as the one in northern Sweden studied here, mercury bound to natural organic matter (NOM) represents a large fraction of mercury in the runoff. We present a method to measure Hg stable isotope signatures of colloidal Hg, mainly complexed by high molecular weight or colloidal natural organic matter (NOM) in natural waters based on pre-enrichment by ultrafiltration, followed by freeze-drying and combustion. We report that Hg associated with high molecular weight NOM in the boreal forest runoff has very similar Hg isotope signatures as compared to the organic soil horizons of the catchment area. The mass-independent fractionation (MIF) signatures (Δ(199)Hg and Δ(200)Hg) measured in soils and runoff were in agreement with typical values reported for atmospheric gaseous elemental mercury (Hg(0)) and distinctly different from reported Hg isotope signatures in precipitation. We therefore suggest that most Hg in the boreal terrestrial ecosystem originated from the deposition of Hg(0) through foliar uptake rather than precipitation. Using a mixing model we calculated the contribution of soil horizons to the Hg in the runoff. At moderate to high flow runoff conditions, that prevailed during sampling, the uppermost part of the organic horizon (Oe/He) contributed 50-70% of the Hg in the runoff, while the underlying more humified organic Oa/Ha and the mineral soil horizons displayed a lower mobility of Hg. The good agreement of the Hg isotope results with other source tracing approaches using radiocarbon signatures and Hg : C ratios provides additional support for the strong coupling between Hg and NOM. The exploratory results from this study illustrate the potential of Hg stable isotopes to trace the source of Hg from atmospheric deposition through the terrestrial ecosystem to soil runoff, and provide a basis for more in-depth studies investigating the mobility of Hg in terrestrial ecosystems using Hg isotope signatures.",10.1039/c7em00245a [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rate of non-native fish introductions have more than doubled over the last decades yet the effect on natural ecosystems, in the scope of biologically mediated transport and biomagnification of Hg and Hg-isotopes, is unknown. Using geochemistry (THg) and stable isotopes (N, Sr and Hg), we evaluate natal origin and trophic position of brown trout (Salmo trutta fario), as well as mercury biomagnification trends and potential pollution sources to three high-altitude lakes. Farmed trout show Hg-isotope signatures similar to marine biota whereas wild trout shows Hg-isotope signatures typical of fresh water lakes. Stocked trout initially show Hg-isotope signatures similar to marine biota. As the stocked trout age and shifts diet to a higher trophic level, THg concentrations increase and the marine Hg isotope signatures, induced via farm fish feed, shift to locally produced MeHg with lower δ(202)Hg and higher Δ(199)Hg. We conclude that stocking acts a humanly induced biovector that transfers marine Hg to freshwater ecosystems, which is seen in the Hg-isotopic signature up to five years after stocking events occurred.

Specifically, competitive carbon flows in the presence of multiple micropredators, as well as trophic links within and between microbial kingdoms have rarely been resolved. Here, using maize-planted agricultural soil as a model system, we have investigated the predation of amended bacterial prey by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic micropredators. We have queried how soil compartment (rhizosphere vs bulk soil) and nature of prey (Gram-positive vs Gram-negative) influence predation outcomes. We added 13C-labelled biomass of Pseudomonas putida and Arthrobacter globiformis to soil microcosms and found that P. putida was consumed much more rapidly. Bacteria and microeukaryotes specifically responsive to the biomass amendments were identified by RNA-stable isotope probing. Amongst the bacteria, only a few myxobacteria sequestered C from A. globiformis, whereas a considerable diversity of predatory bacteria incorporated C derived from P. putida. Diverse groups of heterotrophic protists, especially amoeba including Glaeseria, Hartmanella and Vahlkampfia spp., were observed to incorporate 13C from both amendments, but with pronounced niche differentiation between rhizosphere and bulk soil.

To date, no long-term empirical studies have confirmed that fish populations exhibit adaptive foraging behavior in response to temperature variation and the potential implications this has on fitness. Here, we use an unparalleled 11-y acoustic telemetry, stable isotope, and mark-recapture dataset to test if a population of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), a cold-water stenotherm, adjusted its use of habitat and energy sources in response to annual variations in lake temperatures during the open-water season and how these changes translated to the growth and condition of individual fish. We found that climate influenced access to littoral regions in spring (data from telemetry), which in turn influenced energy acquisition (data from isotopes), and growth (mark-recapture data). In more stressful years, those with shorter springs and longer summers, lake trout had reduced access to littoral habitat and assimilated less littoral energy, resulting in reduced growth and condition. Annual variation in prey abundance influenced lake trout foraging tactics (i.e., the balance of the number and duration of forays) but not the overall time spent in littoral regions. Lake trout greatly reduced their use of littoral habitat and occupied deep pelagic waters during the summer.

"Sołtysiak, Arkadiusz and Schutkowski, Holger",2018,"Stable isotopic evidence for land use patterns in the Middle Euphrates Valley, Syria.",American journal of physical anthropology,"OBJECTIVES: Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios (δ(13) C and δ(15) N) were used to reconstruct the history of subsistence strategies in the middle Euphrates valley, NE Syria, in six temporal subsets dating from the Early Bronze Age (c. 2300 BCE) to the Modern period (19th/20th century CE). The study aims to demonstrate that changes in political and social organization over time, for which the archaeological record suggests different goals of land use and modes of production, register through dietary patterns that are reflected in isotopic data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 173 dentin samples were taken from human individuals buried at three sites (Tell Ashara, Tell Masaikh and Gebel Mashtale) together with 15 animal bone samples. Distribution of the δ(13) C and δ(15) N values in collagen was interpreted in diachronic perspective, and with regard to lifetime shifts between childhood and adolescence. RESULTS: Diachronically, isotope signatures indicate a clear decrease in δ(15) N values accompanied by a small shift in δ(13) C values between the Old Babylonian (c. 1800-1600 BCE) and the Neo-Assyrian (c. 850-600 BCE) subsets. A major shift in δ(13) C values occurred between the Early Islamic (c. 600-1200 CE) and Modern (c. 1800-1950) periods. Ontogenetic changes only occur in a few individuals, but these suggest change of residence between childhood and adolescence. DISCUSSION: The depletion in (15) N from the Neo-Assyrian period onwards is best explained in terms of a shift from intensive to extensive farming, triggered by the fall of regional city-states after the Old Babylonian period and the formation of large supra-regional polities in the Neo-Assyrian period and later. The enrichment in (13) C during the Modern period was most likely the effect of more widely utilizing the dry steppes, abundant in C(4) plants, as pasture.",10.1002/ajpa.23480 [doi],Mesopotamia and carbon isotopes and diet and nitrogen isotopes and subsistence strategies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we contributed to the understanding of the biological impacts of land use on streams, investigating how landscape effects vary with spatial scales (local vs. regional). We adopted a food web approach integrating both biological structure and functioning, to focus on the overall effect of land use on stream biocœnosis. We selected 17 sites of a small tributary of the Seine River (France) for their contrasted land use, and conducted a natural experiment by sampling three organic matter sources, three macroinvertebrate taxa, and most of the fish community. Using stable isotope analysis, we calculated three food web metrics evaluating two major dimensions of the trophic diversity displayed by the fish community: (i) the diversity of exploited resources and (ii) the trophic level richness. The idea was to examine whether (1) land-use effects varied according to spatial scales, (2) land use affected food webs through an effect on community structure and (3) land use affected food webs through an effect on available resources. Beside an increase in trophic diversity from upstream to downstream, our empirical data showed that food webs were influenced by land use in the riparian corridors (local scale). The effect was complex, and depended on site's position along the upstream-downstream gradient. By contrast, land use in the catchment (regional scale) did not influence stream biocœnosis. At the local scale, community structure was weakly influenced by land use, and thus played a minor role in explaining food web modifications. Our results suggested that the amount of available resources at the base of the food web was partly responsible for food web modifications. In addition, changes in biological functioning (i.e. feeding interactions) can also explain another part of the land-use effect. These results highlight the role played by the riparian corridors as a buffer zone, and advocate that riparian corridor should be at the centre of water management attention.",10.1007/s11356-017-8771-5 [pii] and 10.1007/s11356-017-8771-5 [doi],Biological functioning and Fish community and Food webs and Land use and Stable isotopes and Stream ecology and Trophic diversity and Urbanisation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sea ice conditions in McMurdo Sound were quantified from time series of MODIS satellite images for Sept. 1 through Feb. 28 of 2007-2015. A predictable sea ice persistence gradient along the length of the Sound and evidence for a distinct change in sea ice dynamics in 2011 were observed. We used stable isotope analysis (δ(13) C and δ(15) N) of SIMCo, suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM) and shallow water (10-20 m) macroinvertebrates to reveal patterns in trophic structure of, and incorporation of organic matter from SIMCo into, benthic communities at eight sites distributed along the sea ice persistence gradient. Mass-balance analysis revealed distinct trophic architecture among communities and large fluxes of SIMCo into the near-shore food web, with the estimates ranging from 2 to 84% of organic matter derived from SIMCo for individual species. Analysis of patterns in density, and biomass of macroinvertebrate communities among sites allowed us to model net incorporation of organic matter from SIMCo, in terms of biomass per unit area (g/m(2) ), into benthic communities. Here, organic matter derived from SIMCo supported 39 to 71 per cent of total biomass. Furthermore, for six species, we observed declines in contribution of SIMCo between years with persistent sea ice (2008-2009) and years with extensive sea ice breakout (2012-2015). Our data demonstrate the vital role of SIMCo in ecosystem function in Antarctica and strong linkages between sea ice dynamics and near-shore secondary productivity. These results have important implications for our understanding of how benthic communities will respond to changes in sea ice dynamics associated with climate change and highlight the important role of shallow water macroinvertebrate communities as sentinels of change for the Antarctic marine ecosystem.",10.1111/gcb.14291 [doi],Antarctica and climate change and food web and organic matter and sea ice and sea ice algae,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The community in the marine dump had lost the natural temporal variations observed in the reference areas. These effects could be due to the last disposal event carried out in the summer of 2015 or to the recurrent disposals since 2010.

The objectives of this research were to determine the aquatic food web structure and trophic transfer and accumulation of contaminants within a riverine ecosystem and identify potential stressors to the health of an imperiled fish, the robust redhorse (Moxostoma robustum) and other species of conservation concern in a large Atlantic Slope (USA) river. Trophic position was determined for food web taxa by stable isotope analyses of representative producers, consumers, and organic matter of the Yadkin-Pee Dee River of North Carolina and South Carolina. Contaminant analyses were performed on water, sediment, organic matter, and aquatic biota to assess the prevalence and accumulation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), current use pesticides (CUPs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and selected metals. Contaminants were prevalent in the environment and food web components of the river. PCBs were detected in 32% of biotic samples (mean 0.24μg/g dry weight [DW], range 0.01-3.33μg/g DW), and DDTs (legacy OCPs and metabolites) were detected in 90% (mean 0.014μg/g DW, range 0.0004-0.29μg/g DW). The trace metals manganese and cadmium exceeded published threshold effect concentrations in sediment (460 and 0.99μg/g DW, respectively).

Concentrations exceeded the 0.2μg/g WW aquatic life criterion for mercury in 38% of fish samples.

A non-steady state bioenergetics/toxicokinetic model was developed to simulate PCB and Hg concentrations in these two species and compared with field data. Simulations using constant whole body growth rate and constant tissue to whole body weight ratios were contrasted against simulations adopting age specific whole body and tissue/age specific growth rates for their goodness of fit to field data. The simulations using age/tissue specific growth rates demonstrated better fit to field data for PCBs compared to the constant growth rate models (22% improved R(2)), while both models explained similar variation in Hg concentration data. Both species demonstrated higher growth rates of lipids (on a daily basis) relative to whole body and protein contributing to higher growth dilution of PCBs compared to Hg. Although stable isotope data indicated some degree of diet and/or habitat shift, simulations assuming a constant diet concentration explained between 36 and 40% of the variation in fish concentrations for both contaminants and fish species. This study demonstrates that differences in the bioaccumulation rate of PCBs and Hg by Asian carp can be partially explained by differences in the growth rates of key tissue storage compartments associated with each contaminant. These differences in chemical-specific growth dilution subsequently contribute to differences in chemical retention and bioaccumulation patterns of Hg and PCBs by fish.",S0269-7491(18)30404-4 [pii] and 10.1016/j.envpol.2018.08.067 [doi],Asian carp and Bioenergetics and Mercury and Persistent organic pollutants and Toxicokinetics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, estuaries have been used as fishing grounds by the artisanal fishers in Tanzania. The slow-growing predatory fish at juvenile and sub-adult stages are among the most frequently caught species that functionally enhance multiple linkages of energy pathways within the food web. Stomach contents and stable isotopes (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) were used to describe the nutritional sources and trophic niches between the co-existing benthic, predatory species, Carangoides chrysophrys and Epinephelus malabaricus in the Pangani estuary, Tanzania. RESULTS: The findings indicated significant inter-specific variations in dietary composition (PERMANOVA, p = 0.001, pseudo-F = 15.81). The prey-specific index of relative importance (%PSIRI) indicated that juvenile shrimps (%PSIRI = 51.4) and Teleostei (%PSIRI = 26.5) were the main diets of C. chrysophrys while brachyura (%PSIRI = 38.8), juvenile shrimps (%PSIRI = 25.6) and Teleostei (%PSIRI = 23.3) were important diets of E. malabaricus. The isotope mixing models indicated that the predatory fish species accumulate nutrients derived from similar autotrophic sources, microphytobenthos, seagrass and macro-algae via consumption of small fish, including clupeids and mugilids. Yet, they significantly showed different isotopic niche width with varying degree of niche overlap across the longitudinal estuary gradient. This situation was justified by the presence of basal food sources among the estuarine zones that isotopically were different. CONCLUSION: The reliance of both predators on clupeids and mugilid preys that are trophically linked with estuarine and marine basal food sources, is an indication of low estuarine food webs' connectivity to the fresh water related food web. This situation is most likely threatening the stability of the estuarine food web structure. Management strategies and plans in place should be cautiously implemented to ensure the balanced anthropogenic freshwater use in the catchment and fishing activities, for the maintenance of the Pangani estuarine ecosystem health.",84 [pii] and 10.1186/s40709-018-0084-4 [doi],Juvenile fish and Niches and Pangani estuary and Predator and Trophic resources,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stable isotope analysis was used to investigate the contribution of organic sources originated from the Po River Delta, one of the widest deltaic wetlands in the northern Mediterranean Sea, to the diet of the nearby coastal macrobenthic consumers, and their influence on invertebrates' trophic structure and biomass. Following intense river flood events, macrofauna samples were collected in the prodelta area at increasing distance from the main river distributary mouth. Potential primary resources were collected within the delta and the prodelta areas. A terrestrial signal in the primary consumers' diet was evident as a shift in their δ(13)C, being this more (13)C depleted near the main river distributary. The Bayesian mixing models indicated an important contribution of deltaic sources, in particular C4-grass detritus (25-57%), to primary consumers' diet, confirming a strong energetic link between delta and prodelta areas. Overall, most of the consumers' biomass were concentrated at sites close to the main distributary mouth, mainly as suspension and surface deposit feeders. A simplification of the macrobenthic community structure, accompanied by narrower transfer pathways was also evident at sites more distant from the main river distributary, in relation to changes in the quality of resources. Our data, although limited to winter season, suggest that during periods of low in situ productivity but high river flow energy, invertebrates are able to efficiently exploit terrigenous food sources, restraining the detrimental effect of increased turbidity and sedimentation. We conclude that riparian/wetland vegetation associated with river deltas can provide important food sources to marine primary consumers.

Understanding iodine cycling in forest involves study of the ecosystem as a whole. In this context, we determined the (127)I contents and distribution in soil, tree compartments and atmospheric inputs during a three years in situ monitoring of a temperate beech forest stand. The iodine cycle was first characterized in terms of stocks by measuring its concentrations in: tree, litterfall, humus, soil, rainfall, throughfall, stemflow and soil solutions. Main annual fluxes (requirement, uptake and internal transfers) and forest input-output budget were also estimated using conceptual model calculations. Our findings show that: (i) soil is the main I reservoir accounting for about 99.9% of ecosystem total stock; (ii) iodine uptake by tree represents a minor fraction of the available pool in soil (<0.2%); (iii) iodine allocation between tree compartments involves low immobilization in wood and restricted location in the roots; (iv) translocation of excess iodine towards senescing foliage appears as an elimination process for trees, and (v) litterfall is a major pathway in the I biological cycling.

Results showed the anthropogenic impacts on benthic and pelagic organic matter as well as macrobenthos, depending on the spatial and temporal scales. Macrobenthic trophic structure was affected by mariculture and nuclear power plants in the dry season (winter), and the allochthonous sources i.e. industrial and urban sewage in flood season (summer). Microphytobenthos dominated the sediment organic matter pool and macrobenthic diet, while the trophic importance of mangrove leaf litter for intertidal macrobenthic communities was low. However, mangroves showed their indirect effects on the variations in macrobenthic trophic function across tidal levels. The isotopic ratios of benthic food sources and common taxa varied significantly among the tidal levels of the mangrove-lined ecosystem. In addition, pooling the macrobenthic taxa based on their feeding guild and also biomass confirmed the causes and effects for variations in organic matter composition and flow indicated by representative species in the study area.

We quantified the ecological impact of riverine organic matter subsidies to glacier-marine habitats by developing a multi-trophic level Bayesian three-isotope mixing model. We utilized large gradients in stable (δ(13) C, δ(15) N, δ(2) H) and radiogenic (Δ(14) C) isotopes that trace riverine and marine organic matter sources as they are passed from lower to higher trophic levels in glacial-marine habitats. We also compared isotope ratios between glacial-marine and more oceanic habitats. Based on isotopic measurements of potential baseline sources, ambient water and tissues of marine consumers, estimates of the riverine organic matter source contribution to upper trophic-level species including fish and seabirds ranged from 12% to 44%. Variability in resource use among similar taxa corresponded to variation in species distribution and life histories. For example, riverine organic matter assimilation by the glacier-nesting seabirds Kittlitz's murrelet (Brachyramphus brevirostris) was greater than that of the forest-nesting marbled murrelet (B. marmoratus). The particulate and dissolved organic carbon in glacial runoff and near surface coastal waters was aged (12100-1500 years BP (14) C-age) but dissolved inorganic carbon and biota in coastal waters were young (530 years BP (14) C-age to modern). Thus terrestrial-derived subsidies in marine food webs were primarily composed of young organic matter sources released from glacier ecosystems and their surrounding watersheds. Stable isotope compositions also revealed a divergence in food web structure between glacial-marine and oceanic sites.

Despite higher density and biomass, epilithic algae did not make large contributions to aquatic consumers due to the restriction of flow velocity, water depth and turbidity. Aquatic invertebrates specialized in utilization of terrestrial carbon sources, whereas fish varied from aquatic to riparian plants. Different resource use of aquatic consumers across the three reaches in the Irtysh River was ascribed to the spatial distribution of species and resource availability determined by flooding, flood scouring and dam construction. The trophic positions and food chain length at the upper reach were higher than those at the middle and lower reaches.

We compare estimated theoretical yields of biotechnological substrates and of chemicals of environmental concern with experimentally determined yields for validation of the presented approach. A five-compartment dynamic model is applied to simulate experiments of (13)C-labeled 2,4-D and ibuprofen turnover.

The δ(15)N of aquatic biota can be used as indicators of anthropogenic sources of nitrogen enriched in (15)N, but this mostly has been done at small spatial extents or to document effects of point sources. In this study, we sampled 77 sites along a forest to urban land cover gradient to examine food webs and the use of δ(15)N of periphyton and macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups (FFGs) as indicators of watershed development and nitrogen effects on streams. Functional feeding groups had low δ(15)N variability among taxa within sites. Mean absolute differences between individual taxa and their respective site FFG means were < 0.55‰, whereas site means of δ(15)N of FFGs had ranges of approximately 7-12‰ among sites. The δ(15)N of periphyton and macroinvertebrate FFGs distinguished least disturbed streams from those with greater watershed urbanization, and they were strongly correlated with increasing nitrogen concentrations and watershed impervious cover. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling, using δ(15)N of taxa, showed that changes in macroinvertebrate assemblages as a whole were associated with forest-to-urban and increasing nitrogen gradients. Assuming an average +3.4‰ per trophic level increase, δ(15)N of biota indicated that detrital pathways likely were important to food web structure, even in streams with highly developed watersheds. We used periphyton and macroinvertebrate FFG δ(15)N to identify possible management goals that can inform decisions affecting nutrients and watershed land use. Overall, the δ(15)N of periphyton and macroinvertebrates were strong indicators of watershed urban development effects on stream ecosystems, and thus, also could make them useful for quantifying the effectiveness of nitrogen, stream, and watershed management efforts.",10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.03.024 [doi],Ecosystems and Impervious surface and Land cover and Nitrogen and Nutrients and Periphyton,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we present a theoretical framework to evaluate food-web complexity in terms of biodiversity. Food network unfolding is a theoretical method to transform a complex food web into a linear food chain based on ecosystem processes. Based on this method, we can define three biodiversity indices, horizontal diversity (D(H) ), vertical diversity (D(V) ) and range diversity (D(R) ), which are associated with the species diversity within each trophic level, diversity of trophic levels, and diversity in resource use, respectively. These indices are related to Shannon's diversity index (H'), where H' = D(H)  + D(V)  - D(R) . Application of the framework to three riverine macroinvertebrate communities revealed that D indices, calculated from biomass and stable isotope features, captured well the anthropogenic, seasonal, or other within-site changes in food-web structures that could not be captured with H' alone.",10.1111/ele.12973 [doi],Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratio and ecosystem functioning and food network unfolding and species diversity and trophic level and trophic position and trophic pyramid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Graham, Nicholas A J and Wilson, Shaun K and Carr, Peter and Hoey, Andrew S and Jennings, Simon and MacNeil, M Aaron",2018,Seabirds enhance coral reef productivity and functioning in the absence of invasive rats.,Nature,"Biotic connectivity between ecosystems can provide major transport of organic matter and nutrients, influencing ecosystem structure and productivity(1), yet the implications are poorly understood owing to human disruptions of natural flows(2). When abundant, seabirds feeding in the open ocean transport large quantities of nutrients onto islands, enhancing the productivity of island fauna and flora(3,4). Whether leaching of these nutrients back into the sea influences the productivity, structure and functioning of adjacent coral reef ecosystems is not known. Here we address this question using a rare natural experiment in the Chagos Archipelago, in which some islands are rat-infested and others are rat-free. We found that seabird densities and nitrogen deposition rates are 760 and 251 times higher, respectively, on islands where humans have not introduced rats. Consequently, rat-free islands had substantially higher nitrogen stable isotope (δ(15)N) values in soils and shrubs, reflecting pelagic nutrient sources. These higher values of δ(15)N were also apparent in macroalgae, filter-feeding sponges, turf algae and fish on adjacent coral reefs. Herbivorous damselfish on reefs adjacent to the rat-free islands grew faster, and fish communities had higher biomass across trophic feeding groups, with 48% greater overall biomass. Rates of two critical ecosystem functions, grazing and bioerosion, were 3.2 and 3.8 times higher, respectively, adjacent to rat-free islands. Collectively, these results reveal how rat introductions disrupt nutrient flows among pelagic, island and coral reef ecosystems. Thus, rat eradication on oceanic islands should be a high conservation priority as it is likely to benefit terrestrial ecosystems and enhance coral reef productivity and functioning by restoring seabird-derived nutrient subsidies from large areas of ocean.",10.1038/s41586-018-0202-3 [pii] and 10.1038/s41586-018-0202-3 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior studies investigated the relationship between ASGM activities and downstream Hg pollution relying primarily on Hg concentration data. In this study, Hg isotopes revealed an isotopically heavy Hg signature with negligible mass independent fractionation (MIF) in downstream sediments, which was consistent with the signature observed in the ASGM source endmember. This signature was traced as far as ∼120 km downstream of Portovelo-Zaruma, demonstrating that Hg stable isotopes can be used as a tool to fingerprint and trace sources of Hg over vast distances in freshwater environments. The success of Hg isotopes as a source tracer in fresh waters is largely due to the particle-reactive nature of Hg. Furthermore, the magnitude and extent of downstream Hg, lead, copper and zinc contamination coupled with the Hg isotopes suggest that it is unlikely that the smaller artisanal-scale activities, which do not use cyanidation, are responsible for the pollution. More likely it is the scale of ores processed and the cyanide leaching, which can release other metals and enhance Hg transport, used during small-scale gold mining that is responsible. Thus, although artisanal- and small-scale gold mining occur in tandem in Portovelo-Zaruma, a distinction should be made between these two activities.",S0045-6535(18)30495-8 [pii] and 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.03.081 [doi],Artisanal- and small-scale gold mining and Contaminant geochemistry and MC-ICP-MS and Mercury and Mercury stable isotopes and Trace metal geochemistry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These models include those transfer processes (soil-to-plant transfer factor(s) [TF], plant-to-animal transfer coefficient(s) [TC] and concentration ratio [CR]) that are likely to be important for radiological assessment. The range of variability for transfer factors for the same plant groups is great, about 4-5 orders of magnitude, which limits their applicability. A better way to determine the best estimate the factors for radiocaesium and other important radionuclides is if the site-specific data are available. Soil, plant and animal samples were collected from a pasture area in Hungary during the vegetation period in 2016. Stable (133)Cs concentration was analysed by comparative method with neutron activation analysis (NAA). The comparator and the samples were irradiated in thermal neutron flux 2.55 × 10(12) ncm(-2)s(-1) for 2 h (soil) and 6 h (vegetation, animal samples) in the TRIGA Mark II research reactor at the Nuclear Engineering Teaching Laboratory. After an appropriate decay time (12 days) the samples were measured by gamma-spectrometry and analysed. The observed stable caesium TC(pm) (0.48-0.53) and CR(pm) (0.41-0.45) were very close to (137)Cs factors in the IAEA 2009 Report of 0.49 and 0.54, respectively. This methodology is particularly suitable for the simultaneous study of natural caesium in ecosystem compartments.

It has therefore become essential to describe ecosystem statuses with respect to multinational protection schemes, often necessitating long-term monitoring programmes. Changes in the food-web structure, which can be monitored via stable isotope measurements, represent an important descriptor of the status of marine ecosystems. We investigated long-term changes (29 years) in isotopic values (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) in four indicative organisms at different trophic levels in the southern North and Baltic Seas: bladderwrack (Fucus vesiculosus), blue mussel (Mytilus ssp.), eelpout (Zoarces viviparus), and herring gull (Larus argentatus). Time series analyses using generalised additive models revealed largely consistent declines in δ(13)C and δ(15)N throughout all trophic levels of the coastal food web at all study sites, indicating a clear change in these coastal regions from 1988 to 2016. There were no clear long-term patterns in egg biometrics for herring gulls, except for a consistent increase in eggshell thickness. The declines in stable isotope values were in line with the results of previous long-term studies of single higher-trophic-level species, which suggested that the noted changes were mainly caused by altered foraging patterns of the studied species. The current results demonstrate that declines in δ(13)C and δ(15)N have occurred throughout the whole food web, not just in particular species. We discuss the possible reasons for the decrease in stable isotope values, including decreasing eutrophication and an increase in terrestrial carbon sources.",10.1007/s10661-018-6827-8 [pii] and 10.1007/s10661-018-6827-8 [doi],Fucus vesiculosus and Larus argentatus and Mytilus ssp. and Stable isotope and Time series analysis and Zoarces viviparus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the experimental site in Yamakiya, Fukushima Prefecture, we present the redistribution of radiocesium among ecosystem compartments during the entire observation period, while the results obtained at another two experimental site were used to demonstrate similarity of the main trends in the Japanese forest ecosystems. Our observations at the Yamakiya site revealed significant redistribution of radiocesium between the ecosystem compartments during 2014-2016. During this same period radionuclide inventories in the aboveground tree biomass were relatively stable, however, radiocesium in forest litter decreased from 20 ± 11% of the total deposition in 2014 to 4.6 ± 2.7% in 2016. Radiocesium in the soil profile accumulated in the 5-cm topsoil layers. In 2016, more than 80% of the total radionuclide deposition in the ecosystem resided in the 5-cm topsoil layer. The radiocesium distribution between the aboveground biomass compartments at Yamakiya during 2014-2016 was gradually approaching a quasi-equilibrium distribution with stable cesium. Strong correlations of radioactive and stable cesium isotope concentrations in all compartments of the ecosystem have not been reached yet. However, in some compartments the correlation is already strong. An increase of radiocesium concentrations in young foliage in 2016, compared to 2015, and an increase in 2015-2016 of the (137)Cs/(133)Cs concentration ratio in the biomass compartments with strong correlations indicate an increase in root uptake of radiocesium from the soil profile.

Yet field data based on sound experiment on the variation of ecosystem CO(2) levels under HWs remain rare. Additionally, ecosystems react to HWs and the coupled human activities (such as grazing in grasslands) are unknown. Thus, a 3-year field experiment was conducted to simulate HWs in conjunction with different mowing intensities that mimicking grazing in a Stipa krylovii steppe on the Mongolian Plateau. HWs significantly decreased ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO(2), ecosystem respiration (Re) and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) by 31%, 5% and 16%, respectively, over the three years. Continuous HWs over multiple years produced cumulative effects by reducing NEE at 20%, 34% and 40% in the first, second and third HW years, respectively. During three pre-defined three periods of HWs (during HW period, after HW period in the same year, and after HW period in the next year), variations in water use efficiency indicated that the grassland ecosystem exhibited a strategy for adapting to the continuous HWs to a certain extent, by adjusting community structure or increasing litter biomass.

While soils are important stores of terrestrial C, anthropogenic impact on the lateral fluxes of C from land to water remains poorly quantified and not well represented in Earth system models. In this study, we tested a novel framework for tracing and quantifying lateral C fluxes from the terrestrial to the aquatic environment at a catchment scale. The combined use of conservative plant-derived geochemical biomarkers n-alkanes and bulk stable δ(13)C and δ(15)N isotopes of soils and sediments allowed us to distinguish between particulate organic C sources from different land uses (i.e. arable and temporary grassland vs. permanent grassland vs. riparian woodland vs. river bed sediments) (p<0.001), showing an enhanced ability to distinguish between land use sources as compared to using just n-alkanes alone. The terrestrial-aquatic proxy (TAR) ratio derived from n-alkane signatures indicated an increased input of terrestrial-derived organic matter (OM) to lake sediments over the past 60years, with an increasing contribution of woody vegetation shown by the C(27)/C(31) ratio. This may be related to agricultural intensification, leading to enhanced soil erosion, but also an increase in riparian woodland that may disconnect OM inputs from arable land uses in the upper parts of the study catchment. Spatial variability of geochemical proxies showed a close coupling between OM provenance and riparian land use, supporting the new conceptualization of river corridors (active river channel and riparian zone) as critical zones linking the terrestrial and aquatic C fluxes. Further testing of this novel tracing technique shows promise in terms of quantification of lateral C fluxes as well as targeting of effective land management measures to reduce soil erosion and promote OM conservation in river catchments.",S0048-9697(17)32930-3 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.10.211 [doi],Biomarkers and Bulk stable (13)C and (15)N isotopes and Lateral carbon fluxes and Sediment fingerprinting and n-Alkanes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditionally, however, prey abundance (i.e., zooplankton density) has been considered important, whereas prey nutritional composition has been largely neglected in natural settings. High-quality zooplankton, rich in both essential amino acids (EAAs) and fatty acids (FAs), are required as starting prey to initiate development and fast juvenile growth. Prey quality is dependent on environmental conditions, and, for example, eutrophication and browning are two major factors defining primary producer community structures that will directly determine the nutritional quality of the basal food sources (algae, bacteria, terrestrial matter) for zooplankton. We experimentally tested how eutrophication and browning affect the growth and survival of juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) by changing the quality of basal resources. We fed the fish on herbivorous zooplankton (Daphnia) grown with foods of different nutritional quality (algae, bacteria, terrestrial matter), and used GC-MS, stable isotope labeling as well as bulk and compound-specific stable isotope analyses for detecting the effects of different diets on the nutritional status of fish. The content of EAAs and omega-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) in basal foods and zooplankton decreased in both eutrophication and browning treatments. The decrease in ω-3 PUFA and especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was reflected to fish juveniles, but they were able to compensate for low availability of EAAs in their food. Therefore, the reduced growth and survival of the juvenile fish was linked to the low availability of DHA. Fish showed very low ability to convert alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) to DHA. We conclude that eutrophication and browning decrease the availability of the originally phytoplankton-derived DHA for zooplankton and juvenile fish, suggesting bottom-up regulation of food web quality.",ECE33832 [pii] and 10.1002/ece3.3832 [doi],amino acids and compound‐specific stable isotopes and essential biomolecules and fatty acids and food web and nutritional quality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stable isotope ratios of carbon and oxygen measured at the leaf level were combined with field-based and remotely sensed metrics of stand productivity, revealing that variation in iWUE depends primarily on leaf traits (∼24% of the variability), followed by stand productivity (∼16% of the variability), climatic regime (∼13% of the variability), and soil development (∼12% of the variability). Significant interactions between species composition and soil properties proved useful to predict changes in forest carbon-water relations.

Series B, Biological and sciences","Many wildlife species shift their diets to use novel resources in urban areas. The consequences of these shifts are not well known, and consumption of reliable-but low quality-anthropogenic food may present important trade-offs for wildlife health. This may be especially true for carnivorous species such as the American white ibis (Eudocimus albus), a nomadic wading bird which has been increasingly observed in urban parks in South Florida, USA. We tested the effects of anthropogenic provisioning on consumer nutrition (i.e. dietary protein), body condition and ectoparasite burdens along an urban gradient using stable isotope analysis, scaled mass index values and GPS transmitter data. Ibises that assimilated more provisioned food were captured at more urban sites, used more urban habitat, had lower mass-length residuals, lower ectoparasite scores, assimilated less δ15N and had smaller dietary isotopic ellipses. Our results suggest that ibises in urban areas are heavily provisioned with anthropogenic food, which appears to offer a trade-off by providing low-quality, but easily accessible, calories that may not support high mass but may increase time available for anti-parasite behaviours such as preening. Understanding such trade-offs is important for investigating the effects of provisioning on infection risk and the conservation of wildlife in human-modified habitats.This article is part of the theme issue 'Anthropogenic resource subsidies and host-parasite dynamics in wildlife'.",rstb.2017.0100 [pii] and rstb20170100 [pii] and 10.1098/rstb.2017.0100 [doi],body condition and disease ecology and ectoparasite and provisioning and stable isotope analysis and urban wildlife,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They add novel habitat for hard-substrate organisms and modify the surrounding environment. Most research to date has focused on the communities living directly on artificial structures, and more research is needed on the potential impacts these structures have on nearby communities and the surrounding environment. We compared the sedimentary habitat surrounding two types of artificial structures (pilings and seawalls) to sediments adjacent to rocky reefs using a combination of traditional sediment analyses, stable isotope analysis, and environmental DNA. Artificial and natural shore sediments were best differentiated by sediment variables strongly associated with flow speed. Pilings sediments had significantly finer grain size, higher organic content, and generally lower C:N ratios than sediments adjacent to the other habitat types, suggesting flow is reduced by pilings. Sedimentary assemblages near pilings were also consistent with those predicted under low-flow conditions, with elevated bacterial colonization and increased relative abundances of small deposit feeders compared with other habitat types. Additionally, lumbrinerid polychaetes in pilings sediments had reduced δ(15)N values, suggesting different detrital resources and fewer trophic linkages compared with lumbrinerids in other habitats. Woody detritus was greater adjacent to seawalls than to natural rocky shores or pilings. Our findings suggest that artificial structures have the potential to influence adjacent soft sediments through changes to sediment properties that affect infaunal and microbial communities, as well as trophic linkages for some consumers.

A potential alternative method for tracing P uptake in plant-soil systems relies on the analysis of the stable oxygen (O) isotopes of ortho-phosphate (Pi); however, little is known about the fate of the P-O bond during Pi uptake in AM symbioses. This study investigated whether the abundance of (18)O in Pi extracted from the shoots of maize increased after (18)O-labeled Pi added to soil was taken up by either roots of maize or AM extraradical hyphae. A two-compartment culture system, consisting of a root and AM hyphal compartment (RHC, including both roots and AM hyphae) and an AM hyphal compartment (HC, including only hyphae) was designed, and the AM fungus Funneliformis mosseae was used to inoculate the roots of maize. Our results indicated that the abundance of (18)O in Pi extracted from the maize shoots increased significantly 3 months after the addition of (18)O-labeled Pi to the soil in the pots which only contained roots. The abundance of (18)O was much lower than expected, however, which suggests a great majority of (18)O in labeled Pi was lost in the soil or during Pi metabolism in the shoots of maize. The abundance of (18)O in Pi extracted from the maize shoots did not increase 3 months after (18)O-labeled Pi was added to the HC, and therefore, loss of (18)O in labeled Pi may also occur during Pi metabolism in AM hyphae. Use of (18)O-labeled Pi as a qualitative tracer of P uptake during AM symbiosis appears unfeasible for such a long-term (3 months) experiment, although it should be investigated in a short-term labeling experiment.",10.1007/s00572-018-0849-5 [pii] and 10.1007/s00572-018-0849-5 [doi],18O and Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and Corn and Phosphorus and Stable isotope,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA-SIP is well-established but suffers from the shift of (12)C-DNA into the heavy DNA ((13)C-DNA) fraction, which significantly reduces the resolution and accuracy. In this study, we coupled magnetic-nanoparticle mediated isolation (MMI) and DNA-SIP, namely MMI-SIP, to identify the active microbes involved in phenanthrene degradation from PAH-contaminated wastewater. Microbes affiliated to Pseudomonas and Sphingobium were responsible for in situ phenanthrene metabolism from the SIP results, and Pigmentiphaga was only unraveled for phenanthrene degradation in the MMI and MMI-SIP microcosms. MMI-SIP also significantly increased the enrichment of the above microbes and genes encoding the alpha subunit of the PAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenase (PAH-RHD(α)) in the heavy DNA fractions. Our findings suggest that MMI-SIP is a powerful tool, with higher resolution and accuracy, to distinguish the active microbes involved in phenanthrene metabolism in the wastewater, provide a more precise map of functional microbial communities, and offer suggestions for effective management for wastewater treatment plants.",S0043-1354(18)30579-7 [pii] and 10.1016/j.watres.2018.07.036 [doi],Active microbes for phenanthrene degradation and MMI-SIP and Magnetic-nanoparticle mediated isolation (MMI) and PAH-RHD(α) genes and Stable isotope probing (SIP),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ability of organisms to supplement primary nutritional modes along continua of autotrophy and heterotrophy fosters trophic flexibility that can sustain metabolic demands under variable or stressful conditions. Symbiotic, reef-building corals are among the most broadly distributed and ecologically important mixotrophs, yet we lack a basic understanding of how they modify their use of autotrophy and heterotrophy across gradients of food availability. Here, we evaluate how one coral species, Pocillopora meandrina, supplements autotrophic nutrition through heterotrophy within an archipelago and test whether this pattern holds across species globally. Using stable isotope analysis (δ(13)C) and satellite-derived estimates of nearshore primary production (chlorophyll-a, as a proxy for food availability), we show that P. meandrina incorporates a greater proportion of carbon via heterotrophy when more food is available across five central Pacific islands. We then show that this pattern is consistent globally using data from 15 coral species across 16 locations spanning the Caribbean Sea and the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Globally, surface chlorophyll-a explains 77% of the variation in coral heterotrophic nutrition, 86% for one genus across 10 islands, and 94% when controlling for coral taxonomy within archipelagos. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that satellite-derived estimates of nearshore primary production provide a globally relevant proxy for resource availability that can explain variation in coral trophic ecology. Thus, our model provides a pivotal step toward resolving the biophysical couplings between mixotrophic organisms and spatial patterns of resource availability in the coastal oceans.",S0960-9822(18)31141-2 [pii] and 10.1016/j.cub.2018.08.057 [doi],chlorophyll-a and coral reef and heterotrophy and nutrients and oceanography and phytoplankton and remote sensing and stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Iberian Peninsula presents few Early Neolithic sites where fauna and humans can be analyzed together from an isotopic perspective. Here we present an isotopic study on the site of Cueva de Chaves as an example for understanding the dietary and economical changes that took place during Early Neolithic in Iberia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Here we apply carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis to bone collagen from 4 humans and 64 faunal samples from 14 different species. The large dataset belongs to the same unique chrono-cultural context secured by 20 radiocarbon dates. Three direct new radiocarbon dates were carried out on the human remains analyzed. RESULTS: Faunal isotope values show no significant differences between wild and domestic herbivores, although the latter have more homogeneous values. Domestic pigs, potentially considered omnivorous, also show signatures of a herbivore diet. Human isotopic results show a diet mainly based on terrestrial C(3) resources and possibly high meat consumption. The only individual found buried with a special funerary treatment presents a slightly different protein intake, when taking into account the long contemporaneous baseline analyzed. DISCUSSION: Similar values between wild and domestic species could be the result of common feeding resources and/or grazing on the same parts of the landscape. The herbivore diet seen amongst domestic pigs rules out feeding on household leftovers. High meat consumption by humans would support the hypothesis of the existence of a specialized animal husbandry management community in which agriculture was not intensively developed. Our results suggest that the development of agricultural practices and animal husbandry were not necessarily associated together in the early stages of the Western Mediterranean Neolithic.",10.1002/ajpa.23622 [doi],animal management and carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes and cardial and domestication and funerary practices and radiocarbon dating,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little attention has been focused on the effects of redistributions of species on the trophic ecology of a high trophic-level predator assemblage. Here, during a 22-year period (1990-2012) of increasing sea temperature (1.0°C) and decreasing sea ice extent (12%) in Cumberland Sound, Nunavut, Canada, we examined the trophic structure of a near-apex predator assemblage before (1990-2002) and after (2005-2012) an increase in the availability of capelin-generally an indicator species in colder marine environments for a warming climate. Stable isotopes (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) were used in a Bayesian framework to assess shifts in diet, niche size and community-wide metrics for beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas), ringed seals (Pusa hispida), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and anadromous Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus). After 2005, consumption of forage fish increased for all predator species, suggesting diet flexibility with changing abiotic and biotic conditions. An associated temporal shift from a trophically diverse to a trophically redundant predator assemblage occurred where predators now play similar trophic roles by consuming prey primarily from the pelagic energy pathway. Overall, these long-term ecological changes signify that trophic shifts of a high trophic-level predator assemblage associated with climate change have occurred in the Arctic food web.",rsos180259 [pii] and 10.1098/rsos.180259 [doi],climate change and community-wide metrics and fishes and food web structure and marine mammals and stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the stable isotope analysis method, the following was explored: the variations in δ(13)C and δ(15)N values, isotopic niche width and four basal food sources (Mollusks, Macrocrustaceans, Aquatic insect larvae and particulate organic matters (POMs)) among three essential habitat types (the spawning ground, natural riverine feeding and nursery area, and Three Gorges Reservoir area) and between two ontogenetic stages (immature and fully mature stages). A diet shift associated with habitat type changes was observed, but there were no obvious differences in diet composition between the two ontogenetic stages. Dietary plasticity and a preference for specific foods were the important determinants of feeding behavior through the life history of this species. POM was important for the survival of this species in the resource-limited spawning ground, but this species fed more heavily on higher-order consumers in resource-abundant areas.

The overall evidence, from stable isotope and stomach contents analyses, reveals major changes in resource partitioning between the three predators considered, mainly because of an increased access of Franciscana dolphins to juvenile demersal fishes. These results are consistent with the changes in the length distribution of demersal fish species resulting from fishing and suggest that Franciscana dolphin has been the most benefited species of the three marine mammal species considered because of its intermediate mouth gape. In conclusion, the impact of fishing on marine mammals goes beyond the simple reduction in prey biomass and is highly dependent on the mouth gape of the species involved.",10.1038/s41598-018-34100-8 [pii] and 34100 [pii] and 10.1038/s41598-018-34100-8 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate functional responses of TMCF trees to reduced water availability, we conducted a study during the 2014 dry season in the lower altitudinal limit of TMCF in central Veracruz, Mexico. Temporal variations of transpiration, depth of water uptake and tree water sources were examined for three dominant, brevi-deciduous species using micrometeorological, sap flow and soil moisture measurements, in combination with oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope composition of rainfall, tree xylem, soil and stream water. Over the course of the dry season, reductions in crown conductance and transpiration were observed in canopy species (43 and 34%, respectively) and mid-story trees (23 and 8%), as atmospheric demand increased and soil moisture decreased. Canopy species consistently showed more depleted isotope values compared to mid-story trees. However, MixSIAR Bayesian model results showed that the evaporated (enriched) soil water pool was the main source for trees despite reduced soil moisture. Additionally, while increases in tree water uptake from deeper to shallower soil water sources occurred, concomitant decreases in transpiration were observed as the dry season progressed. A larger reduction in deep soil water use was observed for canopy species (from 79 ± 19 to 24 ± 20%) compared to mid-story trees (from 12 ± 17 to 10 ± 12%).

To assess the effects of maintenance dredging work on the Guadalquivir estuary (southwestern Spain), we used a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) approach to determine both direct and indirect effects in two salinity ranges. No effects were found on water and sediment physicochemical characteristics. The small impacts on dredged areas were followed by a rapid recovery of opportunistic species. The poor status of the benthos does not permit the detection of significant effects on macrofaunal community structure. The use of stable isotopes analysis to determine impacts on food web structure showed that changes over time seem to be explained by natural temporal variation rather than the dredging works.

This detoxification ability may largely depend on how AM fungi influence the uptake and distribution of metals in host plants. Two experiments were performed in order to gain insights into the mechanisms underlying cadmium (Cd) tolerance in mycorrhizal plants. Stable isotope Cd(106) and compartmented pots were adopted to quantify the contribution of the AM fungus, Rhizophagus irregularis, to the uptake of Cd by Lotus japonicus. Moreover, synchrotron radiation μX-ray fluorescence (SR-μXRF) was applied to localize Cd in the mycorrhizal roots at the sub-cellular level. The results obtained indicated that mycorrhizal colonization markedly enhanced Cd immobilization in plant roots. Less Cd was partitioned to plant shoots when only hyphae had access to Cd in the hyphal compartment than when roots also had direct access to the Cd pool. SR-μXRF imaging indicated that Cd absorbed by extraradical hyphae was translocated into intraradical fungal structures, in which arbuscules accumulated large amounts of Cd; however, plant cells without fungal structures and plant cell walls contained negligible amounts of Cd. The present results provide direct evidence for the intraradical immobilization of Cd absorbed by AM fungi, which may largely contribute to the enhanced tolerance of plants to Cd. Therefore, AM fungi may play a role in the phytostabilization of Cd-contaminated soil.",33_257 [pii] and 10.1264/jsme2.ME18010 [doi],arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and cadmium and phytotoxicity and stable isotope and synchrotron radiation μX-ray fluorescence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to reveal the impact of the development of agriculture on the human diet over the Pre-Pottery and Pottery Neolithic periods in this region, we analyzed the isotopic compositions of amino acids from the farmers at the Hakemi Use Pottery Neolithic site, and compared them with those from the Pre-Pottery hunter-gatherers in the close region.

This study used stable isotopes to examine the effects of human impacts by contrasting the food web structures of two Iberian estuaries exposed to different degrees of human pressure. More complex feeding pathways were found in the more altered estuary (Guadalquivir). Greater spread among species along the carbon axis suggests that the primary consumers exploit organic matter with various origins, whereas different nitrogen signals of the secondary consumers suggest that they feed on different suites of prey. In contrast, the similar isotopic signals of secondary consumers in the relatively little influenced estuary (Guadiana) suggests similarity in diet composition and feeding on the same organic matter sources.

The extremely high levels these animals present demand for an urgent understanding of such processes and the development of new analytical techniques that go beyond the simple contamination monitoring. It was often proposed that prey selection or habitat use may affect Hg contamination in animals; however, it was never possible to measure which factor influences more rates and pathways of contamination. In this paper, we directly integrate toxicological information (Hg levels) and ecological tracers (stable isotopes of C, N and S) into a common data analysis framework (isotopic niches), with the aim of quantifying the influence of species' trophic behaviour on Hg contamination. The analysis was conducted on skin biopsies of fin whales Balaenoptera physalus, long-finned pilot whales Globicephala melas and sperm whales Physeter microcephalus. Their different trophic modes and residency in the area make them model species for the analysis of Hg accumulation along NWMS food webs. We measured Total Hg (T-Hg) concentrations through absorbance spectrometry with the DMA80 Milestone. Carbon, nitrogen and sulphur isotope compositions were measured via mass spectrometry in an IRMS coupled to an Elemental Analyser (EA) Isoprime. Comparison of ecological and contamination niches allowed to explain Hg accumulation in Mediterranean marine predators. Factors such as food web complexity, trophic position, hunting distribution or habitat use (e.g., foraging depth) did not influence Hg exposure. It is rather the selection of prey type, which determines the range of potential Hg sources and as a consequence the rates of accumulation in whales' tissues. A generalist piscivorous species such as the pilot whales will bioaccumulate more Hg than specialised sperm whales feeding mostly on cephalopods.",S0045-6535(19)31672-8 [pii] and 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.124448 [doi],Cetaceans and Contamination niche and Diet specialisation and Ecological niche and Mediterranean sea and Mercury,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, exposure to manure from cattle treated with pirlimycin resulted in an approximate two-fold increase in ecosystem respiration of recently fixed-carbon, and a greater proportion of recently added nitrogen in plant and soil pools compared to the control manure.

Here we provide an overview of recent advances in uncovering the trophic structure of soil food webs using natural variations in stable isotope ratios. We discuss approaches of application, normalization and interpretation of stable isotope ratios along with methodological pitfalls. Analysis of published data from temperate forest ecosystems is used to outline emerging concepts and perspectives in soil food web research. In contrast to aboveground and aquatic food webs, trophic fractionation at the basal level of detrital food webs is large for carbon and small for nitrogen stable isotopes. Virtually all soil animals are enriched in (13) C as compared to plant litter. This 'detrital shift' likely reflects preferential uptake of (13) C-enriched microbial biomass and underlines the importance of microorganisms, in contrast to dead plant material, as a major food resource for the soil animal community. Soil organic matter is enriched in (15) N and (13) C relative to leaf litter. Decomposers inhabiting mineral soil layers therefore might be enriched in (15) N resulting in overlap in isotope ratios between soil-dwelling detritivores and litter-dwelling predators. By contrast, (13) C content varies little between detritivores in upper litter and in mineral soil, suggesting that they rely on similar basal resources, i.e. little decomposed organic matter. Comparing vertical isotope gradients in animals and in basal resources can be a valuable tool to assess trophic interactions and dynamics of organic matter in soil. As indicated by stable isotope composition, direct feeding on living plant material as well as on mycorrhizal fungi is likely rare among soil invertebrates. Plant carbon is taken up predominantly by saprotrophic microorganisms and channelled to higher trophic levels of the soil food web. However, feeding on photoautotrophic microorganisms and non-vascular plants may play an important role in fuelling soil food webs. The trophic niche of most high-rank animal taxa spans at least two trophic levels, implying the use of a wide range of resources. Therefore, to identify trophic species and links in food webs, low-rank taxonomic identification is required. Despite overlap in feeding strategies, stable isotope composition of the high-rank taxonomic groups reflects differences in trophic level and in the use of basal resources. Different taxonomic groups of predators and decomposers are likely linked to different pools of organic matter in soil, suggesting different functional roles and indicating that trophic niches in soil animal communities are phylogenetically structured. During last two decades studies using stable isotope analysis have elucidated the trophic structure of soil communities, clarified basal food resources of the soil food web and revealed links between above- and belowground ecosystem compartments. Extending the use of stable isotope analysis to a wider range of soil-dwelling organisms, including microfauna, and a larger array of ecosystems provides the perspective of a comprehensive understanding of the structure and functioning of soil food webs.",10.1111/brv.12434 [doi],belowground communities and decomposer and energy channels and food chain and soil food web and soil invertebrates and trophic enrichment and trophic niche and δ13C and δ15N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complementary, ancient and modern shells of limpets and mussels were isotopically analysed to explore changes in the isotopic baseline and compare marine food webs through time after an appropriate correction for baseline shifts. Results confirmed a declining pattern of marine primary productivity during the Late Holocene in the Beagle Channel. In general, the isotopic niches overlapped largely in the ancient food web in comparison to the current marine one, with the exception of that of cormorants (Phalacrocorax sp.).

The most important finding of this work was the very high isotopic overlap between snoek (Thyrsites atun) and hake (Merluccius sp.) during the Late Holocene. Increasing SST as a result of global warming could favour the recolonization of the southern South-Western Atlantic Ocean by snoek from the South-Eastern Pacific Ocean, with a potential impact on the landings of the economically important Argentine and Austral hake.

The variability of traits, however, is often difficult to trace back in nature. Here, we analyzed stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen in muscle samples of 88 S. chinensis stranded in the PRE from 2004 to 2016 to investigate the ecological changes occurring in the dolphins. Stable isotope analysis revealed the existence of two sub-aggregations of S. chinensis in the PRE. Generalized additive models showed significant decreasing trends in both carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures over time, indicating the habitat changes and dietary shifts, possibly due to the influence of increased coastal developments and fishing activities in the PRE. Diet modeling suggests that the proportional contribution of higher trophic-level prey decreased in the S. chinensis diet over time, while increased consumption of lower trophic-level prey was observed. This shift was related to depletion of higher trophic-level prey caused by overfishing. Although S. chinensis could temporarily compensate for the lost energy supply through feeding plasticity (revealed by the negligible differences of isotope niche width among different stranding periods), long-term depletion in prey availability may cause long-lasting negative effects on this dolphin population.

Today, giant pandas exclusively consume bamboo and have distinctive tooth, skull, and muscle characteristics adapted to a tough and fibrous bamboo diet during their long evolution [1, 2]. A special feature, the pseudo-thumb, has evolved to permit the precise and efficient grasping of bamboo [3, 4]. Unlike those of extant pandas, little is known about the diet and habitat preferences of extinct pandas. Prevailing studies suggest that the panda shifted to specialized bamboo feeding in the Pleistocene [5, 6]; however, this remains questionable. Pandas now survive in a fraction of their historical habitat [7], but no specific information has been reported. Stable isotope analyses can be used to understand diet- and habitat-related changes in animals [8]. Isotopic signals in bone collagen reflect dietary compositions of ancient human diets [9, 10] and dietary changes between historical and modern animal populations [11, 12]. Here, we conduct stable isotope analyses of bone and tooth samples from ancient and modern pandas and from sympatric fauna. We show that pandas have had a diet dominated by C(3) resources over time and space and that trophic niches of ancient and modern pandas are distinctly different. The isotopic trophic and ecological niche widths of ancient pandas are approximately three times larger than those of modern pandas, suggesting that ancient pandas possibly had more complex diets and habitats than do their modern counterparts.

Riparian systems may be particularly vulnerable to ALAN. We investigated the impacts of ALAN on invertebrate community composition and food web characteristics for linked aquatic-terrestrial ecosystems. We focused on food chain length (FCL), a central property of ecological communities that can influence their structure, function, and stability; and the contribution of aquatically derived energy (i.e., nutritional subsidies originating from stream periphyton). We collected terrestrial arthropods and emergent aquatic insects from a suite of stream and wetland sites in Columbus, Ohio, USA. Stable isotopes of carbon ((13) C) and nitrogen ((15) N) were used to infer FCL and contribution of aquatically derived energy. We found that moderate-to-high levels of ALAN altered invertebrate community composition, favoring primarily predators and detritivores. Impacts of ALAN, however, were very taxon specific as illustrated, for example, by the negative impact of ALAN on the abundance of orb-web spiders belonging to the families Tetragnathidae and Araneidae: key invertebrate riparian predators. Most notably, we observed decreases in both invertebrate FCL and reliance on aquatically derived energy under ALAN (although aquatic energetic contributions appeared to increase again at higher levels of ALAN), in addition to shifts in the timing of reciprocal nutritional subsidies. Our study demonstrates that ALAN can alter the flows of energy between aquatic and terrestrial systems, thereby representing an environmental perturbation that can cross ecosystem boundaries. Given projections for global increases in ALAN, both in terms of coverage and intensity, these results have broad implications for stream ecosystem structure and function.",10.1002/eap.1821 [doi],cross-boundary subsidies and ecological light pollution and food webs and stream functioning and trophic position and urbanization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address this, we used stable isotope (C, N, and H) analyses of food sources and macroinvertebrates from 15 streams in New Brunswick (Canada) and assessed how different catchment conditions arising from the gradient in forest management intensity affect the contribution of autochthonous resources to these food webs. Aquatic primary production contributed substantially to the biomass of invertebrates in these headwater streams, especially for scrapers and collector-gatherers (25-75%). However, the contribution of algae to food webs decreased as forest management intensity (road density and associated sediments, water cations/carbon, and dissolved organic matter humification) increased, and as canopy openness decreased. This trend was probably due to an increase in the delivery of organic and inorganic terrestrial materials (dissolved and in suspension) in areas of greater harvesting intensity and road density, which resulted in more heterotrophic biofilms. Overall, results suggest that, despite the presence of riparian buffers, forest management can affect stream food web structure via changes in energy flows, and that increased protection should be directed at minimizing ground disturbance in areas with direct hydrological connection to streams and at reducing dissolved and particulate matter inputs from roads and stream crossings in catchments with high degrees of management activity.",10.1002/eap.1889 [doi],algae and allochthony and benthic macroinvertebrate and forest harvesting and road and stable isotope analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An understanding of how food webs and bioaccumulation dynamics respond to these challenges requires the quantification of energy flow. We present a combined, multitracer approach using both polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and stable isotopes to trace energy flow, and to quantify how lake trout feeding strategies have adapted to changes in food web structure in 3 basins of Lake Huron (ON, Canada). This combined tracer approach allows the quantification of dietary proportions (using stable isotopes), which are then integrated using a novel PCB tracer approach that employs knowledge of PCB bioaccumulation pathways, to estimate consumption and quantify energy flow between age cohorts of individual fish across Lake Huron. We observed basin-specific differences in ultimate energy sources for lake trout, with Georgian Bay lake trout deriving almost 70% of their energy from benthic resources compared with 16 and 33% for Main Basin and North Channel lake trout, respectively. These differences in resource utilization are further magnified when they are contrasted with age. The dependency on pelagic energy sources in the Main Basin and North Channel suggests that these populations will be the most negatively affected by the ongoing trophic collapse in Lake Huron.

Two kinetic schemes with and without ANME + DSS consortium formation were tested. The respective models were applied at five influent methane concentrations. A good fit to experimental data was obtained only when assuming active ANME and DSS biomass accumulation. The assumption about incorporation of reversibility of anaerobic methane oxidation and sulfate reduction did not improve the model's fit to experimental data.

Under these conditions, the growth of unpalatable, filamentous, N(2) -fixing cyanobacterial blooms, and their effect on planktonic food webs will become increasingly important. The planktonic food web structure in aquatic ecosystems at times of filamentous cyanobacterial blooms is currently unresolved, with discordant lines of evidence suggesting that herbivores dominate the mesozooplankton or that mesozooplankton organisms are mainly carnivorous. Here, we use a set of proxies derived from amino acid nitrogen stable isotopes from two mesozooplankton size fractions to identify changes in the nitrogen source and the planktonic food web structure across different microplankton communities. A transition from herbivory to carnivory in mesozooplankton between more eutrophic, near-coastal sites and more oligotrophic, offshore sites was accompanied by an increasing diversity of microplankton communities with aging filamentous cyanobacterial blooms. Our analyses of 124 biotic and abiotic variables using multivariate statistics confirmed salinity as a major driver for the biomass distribution of non-N(2) -fixing microplankton species such as dinoflagellates. However, we provide strong evidence that stratification, N(2) fixation, and the stage of the cyanobacterial blooms regulated much of the microplankton diversity and the mean trophic position and size of the metabolic nitrogen pool in mesozooplankton. Our empirical, macroscale data set consistently unifies contrasting results of the dominant feeding mode in mesozooplankton during blooms of unpalatable, filamentous, N(2) -fixing cyanobacteria by identifying the at times important role of heterotrophic microbial food webs. Thus, carnivory, rather than herbivory, dominates in mesozooplankton during aging and decaying cyanobacterial blooms with hitherto uncharacterized consequences for the biogeochemical functions of mesozooplankton.",GCB14546 [pii] and 10.1111/gcb.14546 [doi],Baltic Sea and N2 fixation and amino acids and bloom stage and cyanobacteria and food web structure and mesozooplankton and stable nitrogen isotopes and stratification,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This limits the ability to predict how variations in sea-ice dynamics and productivity due to climate change will affect TE allocation in the food web. Here, food web structure of Tethys Bay (Terra Nova Bay, Ross Sea, Antarctica) was first characterised by analysing carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (δ(13)C, δ(15)N) in organic matter sources (sediment and planktonic, benthic and sympagic primary producers) and consumers (zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, fish and birds). Diet and trophic position were also characterised using Bayesian mixing models. Then, relationships between stable isotopes, diet and TEs (Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and V) were assessed in order to evaluate if and how horizontal (organic matter pathways) and vertical (trophic position) food web features influence TE transfer to the biota. Regressions between log[TE] and δ(13)C revealed that the sympagic pathway drives accumulation of V in primary consumers and Cd and Hg in secondary consumers, and that a coupled benthic/pelagic pathway drives Pb transfer to all consumers. Regressions between log[TE] and δ(15)N showed that only Hg biomagnifies across trophic levels, while all the others TEs showed a biodilution pattern, consistent with patterns observed in temperate food webs. Although the Cd behavior needs further investigations, the present findings provide new insights about the role of basal sources in the transfer of TEs in polar systems.

Our results suggest that in situ production of MeHg within the forest floor and efficient biomagnification both elevate MeHg levels in carnivorous invertebrates in temperate forests, which can contribute to significant bioaccumulation of this neurotoxin in terrestrial apex predators.",10.1021/acs.est.8b06053 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated these structural and functional properties of food webs in stream ecosystems distributed across woodland, agricultural and urban areas in the Zagreb region of Croatia. We compared resource availability and consumer diet composition using stable isotope mixing models and tested how the isotopic variance of basal resources, primary consumers, macroinvertebrate predators and other food web characteristics change with different land-use types. Combination of increased loading and altered composition of nutrients, lower water discharge and higher light availability at urban sites likely promoted the contribution of aquatic macrophytes to diets of primary consumers. Macroinvertebrate predators shifted their diet, relying more on active filterers at urban sites relative to woodland and agricultural sites. Urban food webs also had lower trophic redundancy (i.e. fewer species at each trophic level) and a more homogenized energy flow from lower to higher trophic levels. There was no effect of land use on isotopic variation of basal resources, primary consumers or macroinvertebrate predators, but all these trophic groups at urban and agricultural sites were (15) N-enriched relative to their counterparts in woodland stream food webs. The physical and chemical ecosystem characteristics associated with intensive land use altered the resource availability, trophic redundancy and the flow of energy to other trophic levels, with potentially negative consequences for community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. These empirical findings indicate that reducing nutrient pollution, agricultural runoffs and maintaining riparian vegetation can mitigate the impacts of land use on structure and function of stream ecosystems.",10.1111/1365-2656.12955 [doi],bottom-up control and diet estimates and energy flow and stable isotope analysis and trophic redundancy and urban streams,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We use stable isotope data from stalagmites from northwest Madagascar coupled with radiocarbon and butchery records from subfossil bones across the island to investigate relationships between megafaunal decline, climate change, and habitat modification. Archaeological and genetic evidence support human presence by 2000 years Before Common Era (BCE). Megafaunal decline was at first slow; it hastened at ∼700 Common Era (CE) and peaked between 750 and 850 CE, just before a dramatic vegetation transformation in the northwest that resulted in the replacement of C(3) woodland habitat with C(4) grasslands, during a period of heightened monsoonal activity. Cut and chop marks on subfossil lemur bones reveal a shift in primary hunting targets from larger, now-extinct species prior to ∼900 CE, to smaller, still-extant species afterwards. By 1050 CE, megafaunal populations had essentially collapsed. Neither the rapid megafaunal decline beginning ∼700 CE, nor the dramatic vegetation transformation in the northwest beginning ∼890 CE, was influenced by aridification. However, both roughly coincide with a major transition in human subsistence on the island from hunting/foraging to herding/farming. We offer a new hypothesis, which we call the ""Subsistence Shift Hypothesis,"" to explain megafaunal decline and extinction in Madagascar. This hypothesis acknowledges the importance of wild-animal hunting by early hunter/foragers, but more critically highlights negative impacts of the shift from hunting/foraging to herding/farming, settlement by new immigrant groups, and the concomitant expansion of the island's human population. The interval between 700 and 900 CE, when the pace of megafaunal decline quickened and peaked, coincided with this economic transition. While early megafaunal decline through hunting may have helped to trigger the transition, there is strong evidence that the economic shift itself hastened the crash of megafaunal populations.",S0047-2484(18)30322-1 [pii] and 10.1016/j.jhevol.2019.03.002 [doi],Indian Ocean trade network and Paleoclimate and Population expansion and Quaternary extinction and Speleothems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The implications of this rapid change for lake ecosystem function remain poorly understood. To assess how freshwater communities respond to such profound changes in their habitat and resource availability, we conducted a space-for-time analysis of food-web structure in 30 lakes situated across a temperature-productivity gradient equivalent to the predicted future climate of subarctic Europe (temperature +3°C, precipitation +30% and nutrient +45 μg L(-1) total phosphorus). Along this gradient, we observed an increase in the assimilation of pelagic-derived carbon from 25 to 75% throughout primary, secondary and tertiary consumers. This shift was overwhelmingly driven by the consumption of pelagic detritus by benthic primary consumers and was not accompanied by increased pelagic foraging by higher trophic level consumers. Our data also revealed a convergence of the carbon isotope ratios of pelagic and benthic food web endmembers in the warmest, most productive lakes indicating that the incorporation of terrestrial derived carbon into aquatic food webs increases as land use intensifies. These results, reflecting changes along a gradient characteristic of the predicted future environment throughout the subarctic, indicate that climate and land use driven eutrophication and browning are radically altering the function and fuelling of aquatic food webs in this biome.",10.1111/ele.13238 [doi],cryptic energetic pathways and ecological stable states and habitat coupling and space-for-time and stable isotope analysis and trophic niche,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Internal tree N cycling capacities are crucial to ensuring tree survival but how the N metabolism of forest trees responds to intense, repeated environmental stress is not well known. For 2 years, we submitted 9-year-old beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) trees to either a moderate or a severe prolonged drought or a yearly removal of 75% of the foliage to induce internal N cycling changes. During the second year of stress, in spring and summer, we sprayed 15N-urea on the leaves (one branch per tree). Then, for 14 days, we traced the 15N dynamics through the leaves, into foliar proteins and into the branch compartments (leaves and stems segments), as well as its long-distance transfer from the labeled branches to the tree apical twigs. Defoliation caused a short- and mid-term N increase in the leaves, which remained the main sink for N. Whatever the treatment and the date, most of the leaf 15N stayed in the leaves and was invested in soluble proteins (60-68% of total leaf N). 15N stayed more in the proximal part of the branch in response to drought compared with other treatments. The long-distance transport of N was maintained even under harsh drought, highlighting efficient internal N recycling in beech trees. Under extreme constraints creating an N and water imbalance, compensation mechanisms operated at the branch level in beech trees and allowed them (i) to maintain leaf N metabolism and protein synthesis and (ii) to ensure the seasonal short- and long-distance transfer of recycled leaf N even under drastic water shortage conditions.",5321207 [pii] and 10.1093/treephys/tpz002 [doi],Fagus sylvatica L. and defoliation and nitrogen cycle and protein and soil water deficit and stable isotope labeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biological sciences,"Competition plays a central role in the maintenance of biodiversity. A backbone of classic niche theory is that local coexistence of competitors is favoured by the contraction or divergence of species' niches. However, this effect should depend on the diversity of resources available in the local environment, particularly when resources vary in multiple ecological dimensions. Here, we investigated how available resource breadth (i.e. prey diversity) and competition together shape multidimensional niche variation (between and within individuals) and interspecific niche overlap in 42 populations of congeneric tropical frog species. We modelled realized niches in two key trophic dimensions (prey size and carbon stable isotopes) and sampled available food resources to quantify two-dimensional resource breadth. We found a 14-fold variation in multidimensional population niche width across populations, most of which was accounted for by within-individual diet variation. This striking variation was predicted by an interaction whereby individual niche breadth increased with resource breadth and decreased with the number of congeneric competitors. These ecological gradients also interact to influence the degree of niche overlap between species, which surprisingly decreased with population total niche width, providing novel insights on how similar species can coexist in local communities. Together, our results emphasize that patterns of exploitation of resources in multiple dimensions are driven by both competitive interactions and extrinsic factors such as local resource breadth.",rspb20190369 [pii] and 10.1098/rspb.2019.0369 [doi],Leptodactylus and individual specialization and multidimensional and niche partitioning and niche shift and stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To understand ecological implications of these environmental changes, we studied benthic food web structure on the coasts of Adélie Land during an event of unusually high sea ice cover (i.e. two successive austral summers without seasonal breakup). We used integrative trophic markers (stable isotope ratios of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur) to build ecological models and explored feeding habits of macroinvertebrates. In total, 28 taxa spanning most present animal groups and functional guilds were investigated. Our results indicate that the absence of seasonal sea ice breakup deeply influenced benthic food webs. Sympagic algae dominated the diet of many key consumers, and the trophic levels of invertebrates were low, suggesting omnivore consumers did not rely much on predation and/or scavenging. Our results provide insights about how Antarctic benthic consumers, which typically live in an extremely stable environment, might adapt their feeding habits in response to sudden changes in environmental conditions and trophic resource availability. They also show that local and/or global trends of sea ice increase in Antarctica have the potential to cause drastic changes in food web structure, and therefore to impact benthic communities.",10.1038/s41598-019-44605-5 [pii] and 44605 [pii] and 10.1038/s41598-019-44605-5 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the microbes driving Feammox in an agricultural ecosystem. Here, we demonstrated the occurrence of Feammox in paddy soils of Southern China using a (15)N isotopic tracing technique, and examined the microbial communities associated with Feammox using RNA based stable isotope probing (RNA-SIP) combined with Illumina sequencing. Feammox was detected in all collected soils with direct N(2) production as the dominant Feammox pathway. It was estimated that approximately 6.91% of the applied nitrogen fertilizers were lost through Feammox in the paddy soils. RNA-SIP results showed that the composition of enriched active microbial communities were dependent on soil properties, especially the soil pH and grain size. Geobacter were enriched in most soils across various properties. The abundance of enriched GOUTA19 were significantly higher in soils with low pH than those in soils with medium pH and high pH, and the relative abundance of active Nitrososphaeraceae and Pseudomonas only increased in soils with medium and high pH during 4-day of incubation. These results suggested Feammox is a ubiquitous and important process for N loss. Geobacter, GOUTA19, Nitrososphaeraceae and Pseudomonas were active during the incubation that favored Feammox and the growth of Feammox microbes, suggesting these microbes were potentially associated with Feammox in natural agricultural soils.",10.1021/acs.est.8b05016 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No significant differences were detected in the δ(13)C stable isotopic ratio between the two sites analyzed; however, in the δ(15)N stable isotopic ratio, a significant difference was observed. Regarding the intraspecific response of stable isotopic ratio, D. hanleyanus showed a significant difference in carbon among different body part structures, while a trend for significance was observed for nitrogen isotopes. The differences were significant for both isotopes in E. brasiliensis, and no differences were observed among the body part structures in H. californiensis. There were significant differences in E. brasiliensis carapaces with regard to the δ(15)N stable isotopic ratio between the muscle and the whole body. Although the δ(13)C and δ(15)N stable isotopic ratio differs significantly in the digestive tract, muscles, and whole body of D. hanleyanus, such differences were not enough to determine changes in their trophic levels and food sources.

Studies have shown that N(2) -fixers release freshly fixed N into the environment, but the causes for this N release are largely unclear. Here, we show that the availability of phosphate can directly affect the transfer of freshly fixed N to epibionts in filamentous, diazotrophic cyanobacteria. Stable-isotope incubations coupled to single-cell analyses showed that <1% and ~15% of freshly fixed N was transferred to epibionts of Aphanizomenon and Nodularia, respectively, at phosphate scarcity during a summer bloom in the Baltic Sea. When phosphate was added, the transfer of freshly fixed N to epibionts dropped to about half for Nodularia, whereas the release from Aphanizomenon increased slightly. At the same time, the growth rate of Nodularia roughly doubled, indicating that less freshly fixed N was released and was used for biomass production instead. Phosphate scarcity and the resulting release of freshly fixed N could explain the heavy colonization of Nodularia filaments by microorganisms during summer blooms. As such, the availability of phosphate may directly affect the partitioning of fixed N(2) in colonies of diazotrophic cyanobacteria and may impact the interactions with their microbiome.",10.1038/s41396-019-0453-5 [pii] and 453 [pii] and 10.1038/s41396-019-0453-5 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By measuring fish Hg stable isotope ratios, we related temporal changes in Hg concentrations to varying Hg sources. Additionally, dietary tracers were necessary to identify food web influences. Through combined Hg, C, and N stable isotopic analyses, we were able to differentiate between a shift in Hg sources to fish and periods when energetic transitions (from dreissenid mussels) led to the assimilation of contrasting Hg pools (2000 to present). In the late 1980s, lake trout δ(202)Hg increased (0.4‰) from regulatory reductions in regional Hg emissions. After 2000, C and N isotopes ratios revealed altered food web pathways, resulting in a benthic energetic shift and changes to Hg bioaccumulation. Continued increases in δ(202)Hg indicate fish are responding to several United States mercury emission mitigation strategies that were initiated circa 1990 and continued through the 2011 promulgation of the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards rule. Unlike archives of sediments, this fish archive tracks Hg sources susceptible to bioaccumulation in Great Lakes fisheries. Analysis reveals that trends in fish Hg concentrations can be substantially affected by shifts in trophic structure and dietary preferences initiated by invasive species in the Great Lakes. This does not diminish the benefits of declining emissions over this period, as fish Hg concentrations would have been higher without these actions.",1907484116 [pii] and 201907484 [pii] and 10.1073/pnas.1907484116 [doi],Lake Michigan and fish and invasive and isotopes and mercury,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lizards in warmer climatic conditions ate at a greater predatory to phytophagous invertebrate ratio and had smaller individual dietary breadths. These shifts mainly arose from direct impacts of climate on lizard diets rather than from changes in prey communities.

Rather, exposure to environmental radionuclides was associated with upregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and fatty acid oxidation in the livers - an apparent shift in energy metabolism. Moreover, using stable isotope analysis, we identified that fur from bank voles inhabiting the CEZ had enriched isotope values of nitrogen: such an increase is consistent with increased fatty acid metabolism, but also could arise from a difference in diet or habitat between the CEZ and elsewhere. In livers and spleens, voles inhabiting the CEZ were characterized by immunosuppression, such as impaired antigen processing, and activation of leucocytes involved in inflammatory responses. In conclusion, exposure to low dose environmental radiation impacts pathways associated with immunity and lipid metabolism, potentially as a stress-induced coping mechanism.",MEC15241 [pii] and 10.1111/mec.15241 [doi],Myodes glareolus and DNA repair and RNAseq and pollution and radionuclides and stable isotope,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Foraging on refuse during the rearing period could affect the acquisition of resources with potential demographic consequences. Using conventional diet analysis and stable isotopes of δ(13)C and δ(15)N of blood of Kelp Gull (Larus dominicanus) nestlings, we studied the variation of the chick growth in response to foraging on refuse on a reproductive colony in the Rio de la Plata Estuary in Uruguay. Using Bayesian mixing models on isotopic data, we estimated the proportion and variation of natural food and refuse in the diet of nestlings. Then, we modelled the variation between the mean posterior densities of the food sources and their standard deviation with the nestling morphometric measurements of different sizes. We found that refuse was gradually delivered to Kelp Gull nestlings during the chick rearing period. Additionally, variation of refuse incorporated into nestling tissues increased with nestlings' size. We propose that parents use more isotopically unique food sources during the nestling growth thereby increasing isotopic diversity. This study highlights the need to improve the current waste management system, which is being reviewed in Uruguay.

This is in part because quantifying trophic linkages is a challenge, especially for small organisms with cryptic feeding behaviors such as insects, and often relies on conducting labor-intensive feeding trials or extensive observations in the field. In this study, we used stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen to examine how disturbance (annual biomass harvesting) in tallgrass prairies affected the trophic position, trophic range, and niche space of ants, a widespread grassland consumer. We hypothesized that biomass harvest would remove important food and nesting resources of insects thus affecting ant feeding relationships and trophic structure. We found shifts in the feeding relationships inferred by isotopic signatures with harvest. In particular, these shifts suggest that ants within harvest sites utilized resources at lower trophic levels (possibly plant-based resources or herbivores), expanded trophic breadth, and occupied different niche spaces. Shifts in resource use following harvest could be due to harvest-mediated changes in both the plant and arthropod communities that might affect the strength of competition or alter plant nitrogen availability. Because shifts in resource use alter the flow of nutrients across the food web, disturbance effects on ants could have ecosystem-level consequences through nutrient cycling.",ECE35523 [pii] and 10.1002/ece3.5523 [doi],disturbance and niche space and stable isotopes and trophic position and trophic range,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The last remnants of the European Pleistocene megafauna that survived into the Holocene were particularly vulnerable to changes in habitat. To track the response of habitat use and foraging of large herbivores to natural and anthropogenic changes in environmental conditions during the Holocene, we investigated carbon (δ(13) C) and nitrogen (δ(15) N) stable isotope composition in bone collagen of moose (Alces alces), European bison (Bison bonasus) and aurochs (Bos primigenius) in Central and Eastern Europe. We found strong variations in isotope compositions in the studied species throughout the Holocene and diverse responses to changing environmental conditions. All three species showed significant changes in their δ(13) C values reflecting a shift of foraging habitats from more open in the Early and pre-Neolithic Holocene to more forest during the Neolithic and Late Holocene. This shift was strongest in European bison, suggesting higher plasticity, more limited in moose, and the least in aurochs. Significant increases of δ(15) N values in European bison and moose are evidence of a diet change towards more grazing, but may also reflect increased nitrogen in soils following deglaciation and global temperature increases. Among the factors explaining the observed isotope variations were time (age of samples), longitude and elevation in European bison, and time, longitude and forest cover in aurochs. None of the analysed factors explained isotope variations in moose. Our results demonstrate the strong influence of natural (forest expansion) and anthropogenic (deforestation and human pressure) changes on the foraging ecology of large herbivores, with forests playing a major role as a refugial habitat since the Neolithic, particularly for European bison and aurochs. We propose that high flexibility in foraging strategy was the key for survival of large herbivores in the changing environmental conditions of the Holocene.",10.1111/gcb.14733 [doi],Alces alces and Bison bonasus and Bos primigenius and European bison and aurochs and foraging ecology and moose and stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study was carried out in a Brazilian basin highly impacted by anthropogenic activities, especially discharge of domestic and industrial sewage from a region with more than five million human inhabitants. To evaluate the trophic ecology of both native and exotic species it was analysed carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) stable isotopes of fish tissue, food resources and, sewage. Moreover, stable isotopes analyses were coupled with gut contents of the two species to provide additional information about fish diet. Exotic guppy abundance was high in the most polluted site, where P. reticulata assimilated carbon directly from sewage. The native species was absent in the most polluted site, but presented wider niches than the exotic species in almost all other sites. Gut content analyses indicated high consumption of aquatic insects by both species. However, while the native species consumed a diverse suite of insect taxa, the exotic species consumed mainly Chironomidae larvae. We conclude that aquatic pollution promotes diet shifts in both native and exotic species, with both species changing their trophic niches in a similar way according to the level of degradation of the environment. The ability to directly assimilate sewage, together with its capacity to survive in environments with poor water quality and its reproductive strategy, may favour the establishment of exotic guppies in strongly polluted sites.",S0048-9697(19)32110-2 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.05.092 [doi],Carbon and Gut contents and Isotopic niche and Nitrogen enrichment and Stable isotopes and Trophic niche,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As parasites are integral parts of food webs, analysis of the trophic interactions between parasites and hosts was assessed through comparison of stable isotope ratios of carbon ((13)C/(12)C) and nitrogen ((15)N/(14)N). Largemouth yellowfish (Labeobarbus kimberleyensis) infected with the Asian tapeworm (Schyzocotyle acheilognathi) were collected from the Vaal Dam.

Hosts were enriched by 4.1‰ in the heavy nitrogen isotope with respect to the S. acheilognathi and therefore occupy a higher trophic position than the parasite. Comparison of δ(13)C indicates that dietary sources of carbon in cestodes are derived from the host liver. Comparison of stable isotope signatures between Paradiplozoon ichthyoxanthon (another common parasite of the Largemouth yellowfish in the Vaal River) and S. acheilognathi showed that the monogenean was enriched by 5.3‰ in (15)N which accounts for a difference of almost two trophic positions. Isotope differences in the host-parasite system considered indicate that differences can be related to the mode of nutrient acquisition employed by host and parasites. Cestodes, being depleted in both (13)C and (15)N relative to the host and monogenean (P. ichthyoxanthon), indicate that S. acheilognathi assimilates nutrients derived from the host metabolism which are released from the liver.",10.1007/s00436-020-06619-1 [pii] and 6619 [pii] and 10.1007/s00436-020-06619-1 [doi],Cestodes and Host–parasite system and Monogeneans and Stable isotopes and Trophic relationships,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such aquaculture releases organic wastes, especially feed waste (i.e. food pellets made in part from terrestrial feed ingredients). Terrestrial compounds from feed wastes were used to trace their consumption by the two decapods in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. Both species were collected in farms and reference sites and their fatty acid profiles evaluated. Individuals in close proximity to salmon farms were found to consume waste feed (high proportions of 18:1n-9 and 18:2n-6 and low proportions of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3). This consumption is associated with a reduction in diet diversity and a trend of increased lipid content in rock crab, suggesting that this species is more receptive to the waste feed than the American lobster, which did not show evidence of diet diversity loss and of increased lipid content. Fatty acid profiles from rock crab ovaries were also affected by the diet shift toward waste feed (low proportion of long-chain essential fatty acids), suggesting a potential influence on crab reproductive success. However, this remains to be assessed. Resulting effects of diet shifts on the ecosystem (e.g. reduction in the consumption of primary consumers and change of fatty acids transferred to predatory fish or gulls through decapods) should be evaluated to assess the spatial and temporal scales of the salmon aquaculture footprint. If the assessment reveals a strong footprint, measures to reduce wastes could be considered (e.g. pellets with greater buoyancy or with different recipe).",S0048-9697(19)34855-7 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134863 [doi],Cancer irroratus and Fatty acids and Feeding niche and Homarus americanus and Lipid-correction model and Stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Effects of plants on soil communities are largely taxon-dependent, but how different functional groups of herbaceous plants affect trophic niches of individual animal species in soil needs further investigation. Here, we studied the use of basal resources and trophic levels of dominating soil meso- and macrofauna using stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen in arable fallow systems 3 and 14-16 years after abandonment. Animals were sampled from the rhizosphere of three plant species of different functional groups: a legume (Medicaco sativa), a nonlegume herb (Taraxacum officinale), and a grass (Bromus sterilis). We found virtually no consistent effects of plant identity on stable isotope composition of soil animals and on thirteen isotopic metrics that reflect general food-web structure. However, in old fallows, the carbon isotope composition of some predatory macrofauna taxa had shifted closer to that of co-occurring plants, which was particularly evident for Lasius, an aphid-associated ant genus. Trophic levels and trophic-chain lengths in food webs were similar across plant species and fallow ages. Overall, the results suggest that variations in local plant diversity of grassland communities may little affect the basal resources and the trophic level of prey consumed by individual species of meso- and macrofauna belowground.

Omnivores are able to adjust their diet flexibly according to environmental conditions, such that their impacts on food webs and communities, and the macronutrients constraining their population, can be plastic. In particular, omnivore diets are known to be influenced by prey availability, which exhibits high spatial and temporal variation. To examine the plasticity of diet and macronutrient limitation in omnivores, we compared trophic positions, macronutrient preferences and food exploitation rates of omnivorous ants in invertebrate-rich (secondary forests) and invertebrate-poor (Lophostemon confertus plantations) habitats. We hypothesized that omnivorous ants would have lower trophic positions, enhanced protein limitation and reduced food exploitation rates in L. confertus plantations relative to secondary forests. We performed cafeteria experiments to examine changes in macronutrient limitation and food exploitation rates. We also sampled ants and conducted stable isotope analyses to investigate dietary shifts between these habitats. We found that conspecific ants were less carnivorous and had higher preferences for protein-rich food in L. confertus plantations compared to secondary forests. However, ant assemblages did not exhibit increased preferences for protein-rich food in L. confertus plantations. At the species-level, food exploitation rates varied idiosyncratically between habitats. At the assemblage-level, food exploitation rates were reduced in L. confertus plantations. Our results reveal that plantation establishments alter the diet and foraging behaviour of omnivorous ants. Such changes suggest that omnivorous ants in plantations will have reduced top-down impacts on prey communities but also see an increased importance of protein as a bottom-up force in constraining omnivore population sizes.",10.1111/1365-2656.13249 [doi],ants and ecosystem functions and food exploitation and macronutrient limitation and omnivores and plantations and trophic interactions and tropical forests,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Marine protected areas (MPAs) have thus become an indispensable tool for the protection of these marine predators. Two recently-created MPAs in the Northeast Pacific Ocean, the Revillagigedo National Park and Clipperton Atoll, are characterized by different trophic structures potentially influencing the trophic niche and contaminant exposure of resident sharks in these two sites. In this context, we used carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) stable isotope analyzes as well as total mercury concentrations ([THg]) to assess the effect of foraging site on the trophic niche and Hg levels of juvenile silvertip (ST) sharks Carcharhinus albimarginatus. Analyzing fin clip samples from Revillagigedo and Clipperton, we found that shark δ(15)N varied spatially in relation to δ(15)N baselines, suggesting similar trophic position in both MPAs. Moreover, δ(13)C values indicated that ST sharks from Revillagigedo would feed on different food webs (i.e. both benthic and pelagic) while individuals from Clipperton would only rely on benthic food webs. These differences between MPAs led to a weak overlap of isotopic niches between the two populations, highlighting the site residency of juvenile ST sharks. Within each population, [THg] was not correlated with trophic tracers (δ(15)N and δ(13)C) and was also similar between populations.

Depending on the amount of input, dietary preference, and the strength of trophic links, allochthonous resources generally play a stabilizing role on food webs. In this study, we investigated the stabilizing role of allochthonous aquatic resources on intraguild predation (IGP) and their consequences on shared prey in a terrestrial ecosystem. To this end, we manipulated the input of emergent aquatic insects (the allochthonous resources) from streams to land, and predation pressure by bats and birds (the top predators), in a multitrophic food web using an orthogonal exclusion experiment. Using stable isotope metrics, we found that bats, birds, and spiders (the mesopredators), were highly subsidized by emergent aquatic insects. Moreover, among terrestrial prey, top predators fed more on spiders than insects. As predicted, spiders were strongly affected by the presence of top predators when allochthonous resources were excluded. Consequently, in this scenario terrestrial insects were two times more abundant. Because spiders showed a higher preference for consuming aquatic resources, we suggest that nonconsumptive effects of spiders upon terrestrial insects could be mediating the strong response of those shared prey. We demonstrate that the input of allochthonous aquatic resources can play a fundamental role in stabilizing terrestrial trophic interactions and trophic cascades in riparian zones via decreasing predation pressure.",10.1002/ecy.3074 [doi],diet and emergent aquatic insects and food web stability and intraguild interactions and nonconsumptive effects and tropic riparian forest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To validate this method, we first determined the isotope dosage to be sprayed on the host plants and subsequently detected in SLF. Second, we examined whether 15N mark remains detectable from the nymphal to adult stage. We demonstrated that two stable isotope dosages applied to the host plants were assimilated by the insect and equally detectable in the exoskeleton, wings, and mature eggs ready to be oviposited.

"Almahayni, Talal and Houska, Tobias",2020,Towards dynamic and process-based modelling of radionuclides cycling in terrestrial radioecology.,Journal of environmental radioactivity,"Mathematical models are frequently used in terrestrial radioecology to interpret observations and to assess the detrimental impacts of radioactive releases to the environment. Conventional radioecological models are largely based on equilibrium and empirical relationships with reasonable data requirements, making them practical tools for long-term assessments. But conventional models may be inadequate to simulate radionuclide dynamics in terrestrial environments realistically. Specifically, the structure of such models seldom conforms to the physics of water flow and solute transport in soils. The equilibrium relationships may fail to predict seasonality in radionuclide transfer between environmental compartments; model transferability between sites is often hampered by its empirical nature. Numerous studies have highlighted the need to circumvent these limitations. In this paper, we introduce dynamic and process-based modelling to a conventional radioecological model by coupling an empirical plant module to a process-based soil module that simulates water flow, solute transport and root uptake in the soil column. Illustrative simulations are presented using the coupled model and stable chlorine cycling in a temperate Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand as an example. The model satisfactorily reproduced soil moisture dynamics and the inventory of inorganic chlorine in the tree and forest floor compartments. The inventory of organic chlorine in the stand, however, was overestimated, indicating that processes pertinent to organochlorine cycling at the stand were missing from the model. The approach proposed in this paper is a step towards dynamic and process-based modelling in terrestrial radioecology and impact assessment. It can be particularly useful for modelling transfer of elements, such as redox-sensitive radionuclides, whose behaviour in soil-plant systems is moisture-dependent.",S0265-931X(20)30447-1 [pii] and 10.1016/j.jenvrad.2020.106380 [doi],Chlorine and Compartmental model and Process–based model and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Terrestrial radioecology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biological interactions that affect mercury bioaccumulation are especially relevant as fish assemblages change in response to species introductions and lake management practices. We studied the influence of shifting food web dynamics on mercury in fisheries of Little Moose Lake in the southwestern Adirondack Mountains of New York, USA. Annual removal of non-native Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus dolomieu) has been used as a management strategy since 2000 to restore the native fish assemblage and food web in favor of Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush). Changes in total mercury, stable carbon ((13)C/(12)C) and nitrogen ((15)N/(14)N) isotopes, and growth were evaluated for Lake Trout and Smallmouth Bass. Growth rates increased for both predators and trophic position increased for Lake Trout post-removal. Mercury concentrations in Lake Trout increased over the 16-year study period influenced by a diet shift from invertebrates to higher trophic level prey fish, regardless of increased growth. Smallmouth Bass mercury concentrations decreased with compensatory growth from a reduced population size. These contrasting trends indicate that changes in mercury deposition were not the primary driver for mercury bioaccumulation responses in Little Moose Lake. Stable isotope values changed for both predators and for several lower trophic level organisms, likely reflecting changes in nutrient cycling and/or inputs.

Riparian spiders that predate on emergent aquatic invertebrates can contribute to carbon flux and the structure of aquatic and riparian food webs. The impact of riparian degradation on spiders in temperate rivers of Australia and their role in this broader ecosystem function is poorly understood. We surveyed the riparian zone of four rivers of south-western Australia in areas of natural intact vegetation and degraded agricultural land to explore whether riparian spider abundance, and diversity may be affected by changes to riparian condition. We also assessed the impact of the riparian condition on carbon fluxes between aquatic and terrestrial environments, using stable isotope analysis. We found overall abundance of riparian spiders was higher in degraded agricultural sites compared to natural intact sites and the structure of spider assemblages was different. Orb-weaver spiders (Araneidae and Tetragnathidae) were found to be more abundant in agricultural areas where canopy cover and understory are sparse as a result of livestock grazing and trampling. The contribution of carbon from aquatic invertebrates in a natural intact site was 48.5% for Orb-weavers and 41.6% for Cursorial Hunter spiders but reduced to 19.6% and 39.9% respectively in a degraded agricultural site.

This colonization constitutes the mycorrhizal nutrient uptake pathway (MP) and supplements the pathway through roots. Simultaneously, the extraradical hyphae of each AM fungus is associated with a community of bacteria. However, whether the community structure and function of the microbiome on the extraradical hyphae differ between AM fungal species remains unknown. In order to understand the community structure and the predicted functions of the microbiome associated with different AM fungal species, a split-root compartmented rhizobox cultivation system, which allowed us to inoculate two AM fungal species separately in two root compartments, was used. We inoculated two separate AM fungal species combinations, (i) Funneliformis mosseae and Gigaspora margarita and (ii) Rhizophagus intraradices and G. margarita, on a single root system of cotton. The hyphal exudate-fed, active microbiome was measured by combining (13)C-DNA stable isotope probing with MiSeq sequencing. We found that different AM fungal species, which were simultaneously colonizing a single root system, hosted active microbiomes that were distinct from one another. Moreover, the predicted potential functions of the different microbiomes were distinct. We conclude that the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal component of the system is responsible for the recruitment of distinct microbiomes in the hyphosphere. The potential significance of the predicted functions of the microbial ecosystem services is discussed.IMPORTANCE Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form tight symbiotic relationships with the majority of terrestrial plants and play critical roles in plant P acquisition, adding a further dimension of complexity. The plant-AM fungus-bacterium system is considered a continuum, with the bacteria colonizing not only the plant roots, but also the associated mycorrhizal hyphal network, known as the hyphosphere microbiome. Plant roots are usually colonized by different AM fungal species which form an independent phosphorus uptake pathway from the root pathway, i.e., the mycorrhizal pathway. The community structure and function of the hyphosphere microbiome of different AM species are completely unknown. In this novel study, we found that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi cocolonizing on single plant roots recruit their own specific microbiomes, which should be considered in evaluating plant microbiome form and function.

However, when such species enter higher latitude ecosystems, they engage in novel interactions with local species, such as altered predator-prey dynamics and competition for food. Here, we evaluate the trophic overlap between range-extending and local fish species along the east coast of temperate Australia, a hotspot for ocean warming and species range extensions. Stable isotope ratios (δ(15) N and δ(13) C) of muscle tissue and stomach content analysis were used to quantify overlap of trophic niche space between vagrant tropical and local temperate fish communities along a 730 km (6°) latitudinal gradient. Our study shows that in recipient temperate ecosystems, sympatric tropical and temperate species do not overlap significantly in their diet-even though they forage on broadly similar prey groups-and are therefore unlikely to compete for trophic niche space. The tropical and temperate species we studied, which are commonly found in shallow-water coastal environments, exhibited moderately broad niche breadths and local-scale dietary plasticity, indicating trophic generalism. We posit that because these species are generalists, they can co-exist under current climate change, facilitating the existence of novel community structures.",10.1111/gcb.14898 [doi],diet and niche use and ocean warming and range shifts and stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding their impacts on organisms that use this zone, such as juvenile flatfish, is critical. By combining stable isotope data, digestive tract contents and community analyses of flatfish and their potential prey (benthic macroinvertebrates) from two North-East Atlantic sandy beaches (one impacted by blooms and one not), we detected similar and species-specific trophic changes among three co-occurring species (sand sole, plaice and turbot). Across flatfish species, juveniles displayed more opportunistic foraging behavior at the impacted site. Differently, plaice and sand sole relied more on the additional basal resource (Ulva spp.) than turbot. Finally, sand sole and turbot presented a stronger diet shift at the impacted site than plaice. We hypothesize that the species-specific response to the blooms are mostly driven by how the flatfish detect their prey (using visual and/or chemical cues) and when they forage (diurnal or nocturnal foraging).",S0141-1136(19)30385-X [pii] and 10.1016/j.marenvres.2019.104843 [doi],Eutrophication and Fish diet and Foraging behavior and Macrobenthic invertebrates and North-East Atlantic and Pegusa lascaris and Pleuronectes platessa and Scophthalmus maximus and Stable isotopes and Trophic niche,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The arctic fox population in Iceland has increased steadily over a period of 30 years, an increase that has been attributed to an overall increase in food abundance. We hypothesized that increasing populations of geese or seabirds were driving this growth. We analyzed stable isotopes in a long-term series of collagen samples to determine the role of these different resources. The isotopic signatures of arctic foxes differed consistently between coastal and inland habitats. While δ(15)N displayed a non-linear change over time with a slight increase in the first part of the period followed by a decline in both habitats, δ(13)C was stable. Stable isotope mixing models suggested that marine resources and rock ptarmigan were the most important dietary sources, with marine resources dominating in coastal habitats and rock ptarmigan being more important inland. Our results suggest that seabirds may have been driving the arctic fox population increase. The rapidly increasing populations of breeding geese seem to have played a minor role in arctic fox population growth, as rock ptarmigan was the most important terrestrial resource despite a considerable decrease in their abundance during recent decades. This study shows that a long-term population trend in a generalist predator may have occurred without a pronounced change in main dietary resources, despite ongoing structural changes in the food web, where one species of herbivorous birds increased and another decreased.",10.1007/s00442-019-04580-0 [pii] and 10.1007/s00442-019-04580-0 [doi],Diet and Iceland and Population increase and Stable isotope analysis and Vulpes lagopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with circumpolar and temperate lakes, the responses of subtropical montane lakes to these external stressors have been less investigated. Here we present sedimentary multi-proxies records (i.e. chironomids, elements and stable isotope of carbon and nitrogen) in (210)Pb-dated cores from two montane ponds (central China). Before the 1900s, low biomass and the dominance of opportunistic species (e.g. Chironomus anthracinus-type) in both ponds might be in response to cold and harsh condition. Thereafter, chironomid communities in both ponds experienced pronounced shifts. Nutrient-tolerant/warm-adapted species (e.g. Chironomus sp., Polypedilum nubeculosum-type and Endochironomus impar-type) proliferated and biomass increased synchronously after the 1900s, suggestive of favorable condition for chironomid growth. Redundancy analyses revealed that changes in chironomid communities in both ponds were significantly correlated with rising temperature and δ(15)N depletion. Prolonged growing season and nitrogen subsidy would increase primary productivity, and hence enhancing food availability for chironomids. Catchment-mediated indirect effects of warming and nitrogen deposition, such as hydrological changes and terrestrial organic matter inputs, would impose further influences on chironomid communities. Taken together, the combined effects of climate warming and nitrogen deposition have caused significant shifts in primary consumers of these montane ponds, and imposed cascading effects on structure and function of subtropical montane aquatic ecosystems.",S0269-7491(19)37214-8 [pii] and 10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114256 [doi],Atmospheric deposition and Central China and Environmental change and Paleolimnology and Zoobenthos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, multiple environmental and biological samples were collected from a closed realgar mining area in South China. The As concentrations in the surface water, sediments and soils in the mining area were 0.62-3293 μg/L, 9.53-4543 mg/kg and 7.32-5008 mg/kg, respectively, and gradually decreased with distance from the central mining sites, indicating that historic As mining activities had an eminent impact on As contamination around the mine. The As concentrations in aquatic organisms ranged from 0.60 mg/kg to 45.75 mg/kg and varied markedly among sites and species, reflecting the influence of various physiologic and environmental factors. Arsenic species identified by liquid chromatography inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS) were mainly organic, comprising 8% to 66% of the total As. Both the proportions and concentrations of inorganic As were positively correlated with total As. This correlation could be attributed to the higher assimilation and accumulation of inorganic As or the lower biotransformation ability of inorganic As with the increasing total As in the studied organisms. Values of δ(13)C and δ(15)N in aquatic organisms ranged from -30.59‰ to -15.07‰ and from 4.31‰ to 12.98‰, respectively, indicating multiple trophic levels and variety in the diet sources of these organisms. The δ(15)N increased distinctly in the order of planktivorous<herbivorous<omnivorous<carnivorous, which is generally consistent with the increasing trophic levels in the freshwater ecosystem.

As they are large predators occupying the highest levels of marine food webs, their removal can alter the trophic web dynamic through predatory release effects and trophic cascade. Suitable management of threatened shark species requires a good understanding of their behaviour and feeding ecology. In this study we provide one of the first assessments of the trophic ecology of the ""vulnerable"" smooth-hounds Mustelus mustelus and M. punctulatus in the Central Mediterranean Sea, based on stomach contents and stable isotope analyses. Ontogenetic diet changes were addressed by comparing the feeding habits of three groups of individuals: juveniles, maturing and adults. Our results highlighted that the two species share a similar diet based mostly on the consumption of benthic crustaceans (e.g. hermit crabs). Their trophic level increases during ontogeny, with adults increasing their consumption of large-sized crustaceans (e.g. Calappa granulata, Palinurus elephas), cephalopods (e.g. Octopus vulgaris) and fish (e.g. Trachurus trachurus). Our results provide also evidence of ontogenetic shifts in diet for both species showing a progressive reduction of interspecific trophic overlap during growth.

Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) enzymes are extremely desired and important in the industry of production for goods and biofuel and removal of problematic biofilms and exopolysaccharide (EPS). Biofilms and EPS are complex, requiring a wide range of enzymes for a complete degradation. The aim of this study was to identify potential GH microbial producers and GH genes with biotechnological potential, using EPS-complex structure (WH15EPS) of Acidobacteria Granulicella sp. strain WH15 as an enrichment factor, in cultivation-independent and cultivation-dependent methods. We performed stable isotope probing (SIP) combined with metagenomics on topsoil litter amended with WH15EPS and coupled solid culture-EPS amended medium with metagenomics. RESULTS: SIP metagenome analysis of the soil litter demonstrated that phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Planctomycetes were the most abundant in WH15EPS amended and unamended treatments. The enrichment cultures in solid culture medium coupled to metagenomics demonstrated an enrichment in Proteobacteria, and the metagenome assembly of this enrichment cultures resulted in 4 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of microbes with low identity (42-86%) to known microorganisms. Among all carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) retrieved genes, glycoside transferase (GT) was the most abundant family, either in culture-independent or culture-based metagenome datasets. Within the glycoside hydrolases (GHs), GH13 was the most abundant family in both metagenome datasets. In the ""heavy"" fraction of the culture-independent metagenome SIP dataset, GH109 (α-N-acetylgalactosaminidases), GH117 (agarases), GH50 (agarases), GH32 (invertases and inulinases), GH17 (endoglucanases), and GH71 (mutanases) families were more abundant in comparison with the controls. Those GH families are affiliated to microorganism that are probably capable to degrade WH15EPS and potentially applicable for biofilm deconstruction. Subsequent in culture-based metagenome, the assembled 4 MAGs (unclassified Proteobacteria) also contained GH families of interest, involving mannosidases, lysozymes, galactosidases, and chitinases. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that functional diversity induced by the presence of WH15EPS in both culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches was enriched in GHs, such as amylases and endoglucanases that could be applied in chemical, pharmaceutical, and food industrial sectors. Furthermore, WH15EPS may be used for the investigation and isolation of yet unknown taxa, such as unclassified Proteobacteria and Planctomycetes, increasing the number of current cultured bacterial representatives with potential biotechnological traits.

We determined the accumulation and trophic transfer of 14 PFASs (5 short-chain and 9 long-chain) within the food web of the Yadkin-Pee Dee River of North Carolina and South Carolina, US. Food web components and pathways were determined by stable isotope analyses of producers, consumers, and organic matter. Analyses of water, sediment, organic matter, and aquatic biota revealed that PFASs were prevalent in all food web compartments. Biofilm, an aggregation of bacteria, fungi, algae, and protozoans and a basal resource for the aquatic food web, showed high PFAS accumulation (in 10 of 14 compounds), particularly for perfluorooctanoic acid, with the greatest mean concentration of 463.73 ng/g. The food web compartment with the most detections and greatest concentrations of PFASs was aquatic insects; all 14 PFASs were detected in individual aquatic insect samples (range of <limit of detection [<LOD] to 1670.10 ng/g of wet weight [WW]). These findings may suggest a trophic link between biofilm PFASs and aquatic insect PFASs. Individual fish tissue samples ranged from <LOD to 797.00 ng/g of WW, where perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) was the dominant PFAS among all samples (64%). The ova of an imperiled fish, the robust redhorse (Moxostoma robustum), had concentrations of 10 PFASs (range of <LOD to 482.88 ng/g of WW) and the highest PFOS concentration (482.88 ng/g of WW), indicating a likely maternal transfer. The trophic magnification factors (TMFs) calculated in this study showed that various taxa accumulated PFAS compounds differently. PFBS, a short-chain PFAS compound that would presumably exhibit lesser TMFs, had nine values among our compartments and organisms >1.0 (range of 0.57 to 2.33); it is possible that an unmeasured PFBS precursor may be accumulating in biota and metabolizing to PFBS, leading to a higher than expected TMFs for this compound.

Previous studies have identified a wide range of prey items; however, due to anecdotal or otherwise limited information, leopard seal diets remain unresolved by seal sex, individual, body size, region, and season. Over the 2013, 2014, and 2017 field seasons we collected scat, tissue samples (red blood cells and plasma; n = 23) for stable isotope analyses, and previously-reported animal-borne video from 19 adult leopard seals foraging near mesopredator breeding colonies at Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island. We summarized a priori diet information from scat and video analysis and applied a three-isotope (δ(13)C, δ(15)N, δ(34)S), four-source (fish, fur seal, krill, penguin) Bayesian mixing model to examine temporal variability in both prey sources and leopard seal tissues. RESULTS: The austral spring diets of males and females focused on Antarctic krill (31.7-38.0%), notothen fish (31.6-36.5%), and penguin (24.4-26.9%) and were consistent across all 3 years. Several lines of evidence suggest the transition to summer foraging was distinct for males and females. Female diets transitioned rapidly to higher δ(15)N values (+2.1‰), indicating increased consumption of penguin (29.5-46.2%) and energy-dense Antarctic fur seal pup (21.3-37.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The seasonal increase in leopard seal δ(15)N values, and thus fur seal in their diet, was predictably related to larger body size; it may also be forcing reductions to the largest Antarctic fur seal colony in the Antarctic Peninsula.

To investigate temporal changes in spider prey and variations in prey due to landscape structure around rice fields, carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes of rice field arthropods were analysed over three consecutive sampling dates during the rice cropping season. Initial isotope composition of gnats and midges emerging from submersed rice fields indicates a larval algae diet, while later values suggest a switch to rice-derived carbon. Initial δ(13)C values of plant- and leafhoppers were higher in fields of rice-heterogeneous landscapes, indicating migration from source populations feeding on C4 grasses into rice fields; later, their δ(13)C values approached those of rice. Isotope values of web-building and cursorial spiders in the earliest samples indicate aquatic gnat and midge prey. The later shift toward terrestrial herbivore prey was more pronounced for small than for larger species and in rice paddies near permanent vegetation, indicating use of prey from the surrounding landscape. The results suggest that rice field spiders are supported by three different carbon pools: (1) aquatic carbon originating from algae and (2) legacy carbon from previous growing cycles, both incorporated via between-season predation on gnats and midges, and (3) carbon from the current rice season incorporated via herbivore prey. In conclusion, fostering aquatic midge and gnat larvae, e.g. via mulching, and integrating rice fields into rice-heterogeneous landscapes likely strengthens biological control of pest species in rice paddies by supporting high populations of spiders between cropping seasons.",10.1007/s00442-020-04601-3 [pii] and 4601 [pii] and 10.1007/s00442-020-04601-3 [doi],Biological control and Generalist predators and Rice field and Rice insect pest and Stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, previous studies regarding plant water uptake were primarily conducted in wet areas under seasonal drought conditions, with a limited understanding of the proportion and drivers of plant water uptake under humid conditions. Actually, climate change and variations in global precipitation patterns could simultaneously trigger seasonal drought and flooding. Therefore, it is critical to explore patterns and mechanisms for plant water uptake under humid conditions in wet regions. Here, we employed dual stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen coupled with a Bayesian mixing model (MixSIAR) to explore the water uptake patterns of Populus deltoides in two types of riparian forests (pure vs. mixed stand of P. deltoides), under different magnitudes of rainfall (7.9, 15.4 and 34.1 mm), in the Middle-Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River in China. We further used both partial correlation and variation partitioning analyses to determine the relative importance of soil variables and plant properties affecting the proportion of P. deltoides water uptake from different soil layers. Our results revealed that compared to pure stands, P. deltoides in mixed stands had a lower water uptake proportion from deep soil layers (60-80, 80-100 cm) and had higher water uptake from shallow soil layers (0-20, 20-40 cm) under 15.4 mm and 34.1 mm rainfall events. Our results also revealed that plant properties such as leaf biomass, fine root biomass, and diameter at breast height were the primary factors influencing water uptake by P. deltoides. This suggests that P. deltoides in mixed stands could increase the proportion of water uptake from shallow soil layers through altering plant attributes. These findings indicate that mixed stands could restrain frequent extreme rainfall events and subsequent flooding, suggesting more resilience towards future climatic variability.",S0048-9697(19)35951-0 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.135956 [doi],Bayesian mixing model and Plant water uptake and Precipitation change and Stable isotopes and Stand properties,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We use standardized surveys of 54 North American grasslands to test alternate hypotheses predicting 100-fold shifts in the biomass of four common grassland arthropod taxa-Auchenorrhyncha, sucking herbivores, Acrididae, chewing herbivores, Tettigoniidae, omnivores, and Araneae, predators. Bottom-up models predict that consumer biomass tracks plant quantity (e.g. productivity and standing biomass) and quality (nutrient content) and that ectotherm access to food increases with temperature. Each of the focal trophic groups responded differently to these drivers: the biomass of sucking herbivores and omnivores increased with plant biomass; that of chewing herbivores tracked plant quality; and predator biomass did not depend on plant quality, plant quantity or temperature. The Exploitation Ecosystem Hypothesis is a top-down hypothesis that predicts a shift from resource limitation of herbivores when plant production is low, to predator limitation when plant production is high. In grasslands where spider biomass was low, herbivore biomass increased with plant biomass, whereas bottom-up structuring was not evident when spiders were abundant. Furthermore, neither predator biomass nor trophic position (via stable isotope analysis) increased with plant biomass, suggesting predators themselves are top-down limited. Stable isotope analysis revealed that trophic position of the chewing herbivore and omnivore increased significantly with plant biomass, suggesting these groups increased scavenging and meat consumption in grasslands with higher carbohydrate availability. Taken together, our snapshot sampling documents gradients of food web structure across 54 grasslands, consistent with multiple hypotheses of bottom-up and top-down regulation.",10.1111/1365-2656.13191 [doi],Exploitation Ecosystem Hypothesis and biomass and grasshopper and insect and katydid and leafhopper and prairie and spider,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Maraun, Mark and Augustin, Dana and Pollierer, Melanie M and Scheu, Stefan",2020,Variation in trophic niches of oribatid mites in temperate forest ecosystems as indicated by neutral lipid fatty acid patterns.,Experimental & applied acarology,"Shifting of trophic niches of soil microarthropods may allow them to adapt to changing resource conditions as induced by global change processes. However, the capability of microarthropods to shift their trophic niches is little studied. Whereas some studies based on stable isotopes ((15)N/(13)C) point to distinct and narrow trophic niches, others indicate that trophic niches are plastic. Here, we investigated shifts in trophic niches of oribatid mites (Oribatida, Acari), a major soil detritivore microarthropod group, due to forest management, i.e., plantation of beech and spruce forests in Central Europe, using neutral lipid fatty acid (NLFA) markers. Due to differential microbial communities, we expected a fungi-based diet of oribatid mites in beech forest, but more bacterial contributions to the diet in spruce forest. Supporting these hypotheses, NLFA markers indicated that the trophic niches of each of the studied oribatid mite species differed between beech and spruce forests and shifted from feeding predominantly on litter and fungi in beech forest to more intensively feeding on bacteria in spruce forest. Oribatid mite species with the most pronounced differences in trophic niches included Achipteria coleoptrata, Eupelops hirtus, Eupelops plicatus and Liacarus xylariae, which had been classified as primary or secondary decomposers in previous studies. Overall, the results indicate that the ability of oribatid mite species to colonize different habitats and ecosystems is due to their ability to adjust their diet, i.e., to trophic plasticity. Changes in trophic niches in each of the studied oribatid mite species suggest that detritivores in soil may better cope with future changes in environmental conditions and associated changes in resource composition than species above the ground.",10.1007/s10493-020-00494-2 [pii] and 494 [pii] and 10.1007/s10493-020-00494-2 [doi],Global change and NLFA and Oribatida and Trophic niche,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such ecosystems may be monitored by examining the diet of upper trophic level species, which varies with prey availability. To assess interannual variation in the Beaufort Sea ecosystem, we examined spatial and temporal trends in ringed seal (Pusa hispida) δ(13)C and δ(15)N in claw growth layers grown from 1964 to 2011. Stable isotopes were correlated with climate indices, environmental conditions, seal population productivity, and geographic location. Sex and age did not influence stable isotopes. Enriched (13)C was linked to cyclonic circulation regimes, seal productivity, and westward sampling locations. Higher δ(15)N was linked to lower sea surface temperatures, a higher percentage of pups in the subsistence harvest, and sample locations that were eastward and further from shore. From the 1960s to 2000s, ringed seal niche width expanded, suggesting a diversification of diet due to expansion of prey and/or seal space use. Overall, trends in ringed seal stable isotopes indicate changes within the Beaufort Sea ecosystem affected by water temperatures and circulation regimes. We suggest that continued monitoring of upper trophic level species will yield insights into changing ecosystem structure with climate change.",ECE36186 [pii] and 10.1002/ece3.6186 [doi],Beaufort Sea and Pusa hispida and climate change and niche width and ringed seal and stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In total, 35 structurally-related (epi)catechin metabolites (SREMs) and 5-carbon side chain ring fission metabolites (5C-RFMs) (phenyl-γ-valerolactones and phenylvaleric acids), and 50 phenolic acid and aromatic catabolites were detected after intakes of both extracts. The consumption of the RWP extract, but not the GSP extract, led to the appearance of a ∼200 nmol L(-1) peak plasma concentration of SREMs formed from flavan-3-ol monomers. In contrast, ingestion of the GSPs, but not the RWPs, resulted in a substantial increase in microbiota-derived 5-carbon side chain ring fission metabolites (5C-RFMs) in plasma. 5C-RFMs, along with low molecular weight phenolic catabolites were detected in urine after ingestion of both extracts. The GSP and RWP extracts had respective mean degrees of polymerisation 5.9 and 6.5 subunits, and the RWP extract had an upper polymer size of 21 subunits compared to 44 subunits for the GSP extract. The differences in plasma metabolite profiles might, therefore, be a consequence of this polydispersity impacting on the microbiota-mediated rates of cleavage of the proanthocyanidin subunits and their subsequent metabolism and absorption. Urinary excretion of phenolic catabolites indicated that 11% of RWPs and 7% for GSPs were subjected to microbial degradation. In all probability these figures, rather than representing the percentage of proanthocyanidins that are completely degraded, indicate partial cleavage of monomer subunits producing a much higher percentage of shortened proanthocyanidin chains. Obtaining more detailed information on the in vivo fate of proanthocyanidins is challenging because of the difficulties in analysing unabsorbed parent proanthocyanidins and their partially degraded flavan-3-ol subunit chains in feces. Further progress awaits the development of improved purification and analytical techniques for proanthocyanidins and their use in feeding studies, and in vitro fecal and bacterial incubations, with radio and/or stable isotope-labelled substrates.",10.1039/d0fo00350f [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantifying trophic position-individual body size relationships (trophic allometries) underpins the development of size-structured ecosystem models to predict abundance and the transfer of energy through ecosystems. Trophic allometries are well studied for fishes but remain relatively unexplored for cephalopods. Cephalopods are important components of coastal, oceanic and deep-sea ecosystems, and they play a key role in the transfer of biomass from low trophic positions to higher predators. It is therefore important to resolve cephalopod trophic allometries to accurately represent them within size-structured ecosystem models. We assessed the trophic positions of cephalopods in an oceanic pelagic (0-500 m) community (sampled by trawling in a cold-core eddy in the western Tasman Sea), comprising 22 species from 12 families, using bulk tissue stable isotope analysis and amino acid compound-specific stable isotope analysis. We assessed whether ontogenetic trophic position shifts were evident at the species-level and tested for the best predictor of community-level trophic allometry among body size, taxonomy and functional grouping (informed by fin and mantle morphology). Individuals in this cephalopod community spanned two trophic positions and fell into three functional groups on an activity level gradient: low, medium and high. The relationship between trophic position and ontogeny varied among species, with the most marked differences evident between species from different functional groups. Activity-level-based functional group and individual body size are best explained by cephalopod trophic positions (marginal R(2)  = 0.43). Our results suggest that the morphological traits used to infer activity level, such as fin-to-mantle length ratio, fin musculature and mantle musculature are strong predictors of cephalopod trophic allometries. Contrary to established theory, not all cephalopods are voracious predators. Low activity level cephalopods have a distinct feeding mode, with low trophic positions and little-to-no ontogenetic increases. Given the important role of cephalopods in marine ecosystems, distinct feeding modes could have important consequences for energy pathways and ecosystem structure and function. These findings will facilitate trait-based and other model estimates of cephalopod abundance in the changing global ocean.",10.1111/1365-2656.13333 [doi],food web and mesopelagic and octopus and ontogenetic diet shift and predator-prey interaction and size spectrum and squid and trophodynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sampled surface water and biota from 8 lakes in Quebec, Canada, spanning a range of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (2.9-8.4 mg/L); 4 lakes were inhabited by native brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), and the remaining lakes contained brook trout and a non-native fish, Allegheny pearl dace (Margariscus margarita). Periphyton, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, and fish were analyzed for: 1) stable carbon (δ(13) C) and nitrogen (δ(15) N) isotope ratios to delineate food webs, and 2) total Hg (THg) or MeHg. Compared with the brook trout from reference lakes, fish from invaded lakes had higher length-standardized THg concentrations as well as a narrower dietary range and elevated trophic level, inferred from unadjusted δ(13) C and δ(15) N values, respectively. The rate of Hg biomagnification was similar across invaded and reference lakes, implying little effect of the invasive fish on the trophic transfer of MeHg. Despite differences in food web structure due to pearl dace invasion, DOC was the strongest predictor of brook trout THg levels for all lakes, suggesting that underlying environmental factors exerted a stronger influence on brook trout THg concentrations than the presence of a non-native forage fish.

Mercury (Hg) is a global pollutant, which can biomagnify along marine and freshwater food webs. Therefore, mercury body burden in seabirds, such as gulls, will integrate information about pollution in the environment. In the Ebro Delta (NE Spain), legacy mercury pollution from a chlor-alkali industry located ca. 100 km upstream of the Ebro river mouth has been affecting the delta environment. We have analyzed a 15-year temporal series (2004-2019) of Hg in birds from a breeding colony of Audouin's gull (Ichthyaetus audouinii) in the Ebro Delta to understand how fluctuations in Hg levels are coupled to human activities in the industrial area in the upstream region of the river. Stable isotopic signatures of C and N (δ(13)C(bulk) and δ(15)N(bulk)) are determined to characterize the trophic ecology of the species. Since only δ(13)C(bulk) but not δ(15)N(bulk) was associated with THg levels, we used compound-specific stable nitrogen isotope analysis of amino acids (AA-CSIA) to evaluate the causes of variation in δ(15)N(bulk) to further investigate the idea of a decoupling of δ(15)N(bulk) and THg over time.

However, the manner in which eutrophication triggers a series of cascade effects in the whole food web in coastal lagoons has received little attention. Using stable isotope (SI) analyses, we investigated the food web structure in the hypertrophic lagoon of Yundang (Xiamen, China) in two periods of the year characterized by the recurrent alternation of Ulva lactuca and phytoplankton blooms in the cool (March) and warm (September) seasons, respectively. Large temporal fluctuations in the dominance of primary producers (i.e. macroalgae vs. phytoplankton) and, thus, in the available food items, were reflected in major changes in the diet and SI signals of several primary consumers, such as the amphipod Grandidierella japonica, the polychaetes Neanthes japonica and Capitella capitata, and omnivorous fishes (i.e. Mugil cephalus, Oreochromis niloticus, and Sardinella zunasi), while these changes were limited in top carnivorous fishes, such as Lateolabrax japonicus. Furthermore, reduced macrozoobenthic abundance available for omnivores in September was found to force omnivores to switch their feeding habits to those of herbivores. The present study provides evidence that the periodical alternation of macroalgal and phytoplankton blooms throughout the year strongly affect the relations among different trophic levels leading to a cascading effect across the whole food web and to major changes in the lagoon's food web structure. Importantly, our study shows that the lagoon's food web structure under persistent eutrophic conditions can still cope with seasonal changes in primary energy source type from macroalgae to microalgae due to the ability of omnivorous fishes to conduit different food sources up to the highest trophic levels. Thus, this study suggests that in such a highly variable eutrophic system, omnivores play a central role in the lagoon's functioning, and help to sustain the biological resources and the ecosystem services provided by the lagoon.",S0141-1136(20)30413-X [pii] and 10.1016/j.marenvres.2020.105128 [doi],Coastal lagoons and Eutrophication and Trophic levels and Variation and δ(13)C and δ(15)N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By combining geophysical methods, isotopic ecology, plant ecophysiology and anatomical measurements, we show how coexisting pine and oak species share, use and temporally switch between diverse spatially distinct niches by employing a set of functionally coupled plant traits in response to changing environmental signals. We identified four geospatial niches that turned into nine, when considering the temporal dynamics of the wetting/drying cycles in the substrate and the particular plant species adaptations to garner, transfer, store and use water. Under water scarcity, pine and oak exhibited water use segregation from different niches, yet under maximum drought when oak trees crossed physiological thresholds, niche overlap occurred.

Both methods observed ontogenetic shifts in dietary preference and individual specializations, and revealed that the total niche width of large individuals was greater than small individuals. Mixed linear models indicated that feeding activity was significantly influenced by time (p < 0.0001), and no significant changes among size groups was evident (p = 0.244). Niche overlaps revealed that there was intensive diet competition between different size groups of black amur bream. Individual specialization in small juveniles was likely to be stronger than sub-adult and adult groups.

As top predators with a long lifespan, they are prone to exposure to various contaminants such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and contaminants of emerging concern. In this study, three pollutant families were investigated, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs) and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), including perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). Contamination was investigated in individuals from three tropical tuna species, namely bigeye (Thunnus obesus), skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) and yellowfin (Thunnusalbacares) tunas and the billfish swordfish (Xiphias gladius), collected from various areas of the western Indian Ocean (WIO) in 2013-2014. Contamination levels and profiles were examined in fish muscle, together with biological parameters (fish length / age, sex, lipid content) and ecological tracers (carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes). POP levels were low in all species in comparison to other locations worldwide, revealing a low impact of anthropogenic organic contaminants in the WIO. A predominance of OCPs (especially DDTs) versus PCBs was highlighted in all species; PFASs were predominant over chlorinated POPs in tunas. Among the studied PFASs, long-chain PFCAs were found to prevail over PFOS in all species. Organic contaminant profiles differed across species according to their foraging habitat; swordfish and bigeye tuna, which both feed in deep oceanic layers, showed similarities in their contaminant profiles. Geographically, the distinct DDT profiles of fish from the Mozambique Channel suggested an exposure to different DDT sources, in line with regional use of this insecticide and coupled with an extended residence time of fish in the Channel.

Arthropod populations in turn are influenced by climate because temperature affects survival and reproduction, and larval development. Thus, climate factors have the potential to influence many bird species during their reproductive phases. In this study, we assessed climate factors that impact the diet of nestling White-headed Woodpecker (Dryobates albolarvatus), an at-risk keystone species in much of its range in western North America. To do this, we measured stable isotope signatures (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) in 152 nestlings across six years and linked variation in isotopic values to winter (December-February) and spring (June) precipitation and temperature using mixed effects models. We also explored habitat factors that may impact δ(13)C and δ(15)N and the relationship between δ(15)N and nest productivity. Last, we estimated isotopic niche width for nestlings in different watersheds and years using Bayesian standard ellipses, which allowed us to compare dietary niche width and overlap. We found that colder winter temperatures were associated with an increase in δ(15)N and δ(15)N levels had a weak positive relationship with nest productivity. We also found that sites with a more diverse tree community were associated with a broader isotopic niche width in nestlings. Our findings suggest that nestling diet is affected by climate, and under future warming climate scenarios, White-headed Woodpecker nestling diet may shift in favor of lower trophic level prey (prey with lower δ(15)N levels).

METHODS: Nineteen children (n = 10 boys, n = 9 girls) at Tanner stage I or II participated (mean age ± 95% CI = 9.84 ± 0.77 y) in this study. Food was administered to the children for three days preceding their scheduled breath tests. Breath tests and indirect calorimetry were performed after an 8-h fast before and 60 min following consumption of a 30-g simple RDC drink consisting of maltodextrin and sucrose. Open circuit spirometry and indirect calorimetry monitored resting metabolism and CHO oxidation. Separate breath samples were taken every 15 min. Samples of all foods and breath samples were analyzed for (13)C and (12)C abundances with a stable-isotope mass spectrometer. RESULTS: (13)C in expired breath samples were -23.81 ± 1.64‰ at baseline and increased every 15 min after consumption of the CHO drink (p < 0.001-0.009). Cumulative total, endogenous, and exogenous CHO utilization increased during the post-prandial period (p < 0.001). Endogenous CHO oxidation was consistently greater than exogenous CHO oxidation (p < 0.001-0.002).Blood glucose was elevated from baseline at 30- and 60-min post-prandial (p < 0.001). Insulin did not change over time (p = 0.184). CONCLUSIONS: The foods provided during the 3-day controlled diet effectively minimized (13)C variation prior to metabolic testing. The (13)C abundances of foods reported herein should serve as practical recommendations to reduce (13)C intake before breath tests. While endogenous CHO oxidation remained greater in proportion to exogenous CHO oxidation, these findings suggest that even a relatively small amount of RDC can increase exogenous CHO oxidation and blood glucose in normal-weight children. To further examine shifts in endogenous versus exogenous CHO utilization, we recommend that future studies take steps to minimize (13)C variation before breath tests and examine changes in substrate metabolism at rest and during exercise in normal weight and overweight pre-pubescent children.

Due to analytical costs constraining the scope, sample size, and range of congeners analyzed, and variation in methodologies preventing cross-study syntheses, how PCBs biomagnify at food web, regional, and global scales remains uncertain. To overcome these constraints, we compiled diet (stable isotopes) data and lipid-normalized concentrations of sum total PCB (PCB(ST)), seven indicator PCB congeners, and their sum (PCB(∑7)). Our analyses revealed that the number of congeners analyzed, region, and class most strongly predicted PCB(ST), while similarly, region, class, and feeding location best predicted PCB(∑7) and all seven congeners. We also discovered that PCB(ST), PCB(∑7), and the seven indicator congeners all occur in higher concentrations in freshwater than marine ecosystems but are more likely to biomagnify in the latter. Moreover, although the seven congeners vary in their propensity to biomagnify, their trophic magnification factors are all generally greater in the Atlantic than the Pacific. Thus, novel insights regarding PCB biomagnification across taxonomic, food webs, regional, and global scales can be gleaned by leveraging existing data to overcome analytical constraints.",10.1021/acs.est.9b07693 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

O(2) concentration plays a key role in AME-D, yet little is understood about how it impacts microbial interactions. Here, we applied isotopically labeled K(15)NO(3) and (13)CH(4) and metagenomic analyses to investigate the metabolic and microbial link of AME-D at different O(2) levels. Among the four experimental O(2) levels of 21%,10%, 5% and 2.5% and a CH(4) concentration of 8% (i.e., the O(2)/CH(4) ratios of 2.62, 1.26, 0.63 and 0.31), the highest NO(3)(-)-N removal occurred in the AME-D system incubated at the O(2) concentration of 10%. Methanol and acetate may serve as the trophic linkage between aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifers in the AME-D systems. Methylotrophs including Methylophilus, Methylovorus, Methyloversatilis and Methylotenera were abundant under the O(2)-sufficient condition with the O(2) concentration of 21%, while denitrifiers such as Azoarcus, Thauera and Thiobacillus dominated in the O(2)-limited environment with the O(2) concentration of 10%. The competition of denitrifiers and methylotrophs in the AME-D system for CH(4)-derived carbon, such as methanol and acetate, might be influenced by chemotactic responses. More methane-derived carbon flowed into methylotrophs under the O(2)-sufficient condition, while more methane-derived carbon was used for denitrification in the O(2)-limited environment. These findings can aid in evaluating the distribution and contribution of AME-D and in developing strategies for mitigating CH(4) emission and nitrogen pollution in natural and engineered ecosystems.",S0048-9697(20)36431-7 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142901 [doi],Aerobic CH(4) oxidation coupled to denitrification and Aerobic methanotrophs and Denitrifers and Metagenomic analyses and O(2) concentration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Total Hg and stable isotopes were measured in samples of particulate organic matter (POM), zooplankton, squid, myctophid fish, notothenioid fish and seabird tissues collected in two years (austral summers 2007/08 and 2016/17). Overall, there was extensive overlap in δ(13)C values across taxonomic groups suggesting similarities in habitats, with the exception of the seabirds, which showed some differences, possibly due to the type of tissue analysed (feathers instead of muscle). δ(15)N showed increasing enrichment across groups in the order POM to zooplankton to squid to myctophid fish to notothenioid fish to seabirds. There were significant differences in δ(1)(5)N and δ(1)(3)C values among species within taxonomic groups, reflecting inter-specific variation in diet. Hg concentrations increased with trophic level, with the lowest values in POM (0.0005 ± 0.0002 μg g(-1) dw) and highest values in seabirds (3.88 ± 2.41 μg g(-1) in chicks of brown skuas Stercorarius antarcticus). Hg concentrations tended to be lower in 2016/17 than in 2007/08 for mid-trophic level species (squid and fish), but the opposite was found for top predators (i.e. seabirds), which had higher levels in the 2016/17 samples. This may reflect an interannual shift in the Scotia Sea marine food web, caused by the reduced availability of a key prey species, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. In 2016/17, seabirds would have been forced to feed on higher trophic-level prey, such as myctophids, that have higher Hg burdens.

Here, we use herring gull (Larus argentatus) eggs to evaluate temporal changes in total mercury (THg) availability from two locations on Great Slave Lake (GSL), Northwest Territories, Canada. Egg THg concentrations increased through time, but this change was due to shifts in gull diets. Stable nitrogen isotopes allowed adjustment of egg THg concentrations for dietary changes. Diet-adjusted egg THg concentrations showed no long-term trend. Consistent with that result, new statistical analysis of THg concentrations in three species of GSL fish showed minor or no temporal changes. Although a long-term trend was absent, inter-year differences in adjusted egg THg concentrations persisted. Contributions of environmental variables (i.e., river flow, lake level, air temperature, precipitation, and wildfire) to these differences were investigated. Egg THg concentrations were greater following years of lower lake levels and greater wildfire extent. Lake level could have affected mercury methylation. Increased wildfire could have enhanced terrestrial Hg releases to the atmosphere where it was transported long distances to GSL. Climate change may increase wildfire extent with impacts on Hg bioaccumulation in northern ecosystems. Egg Hg levels reported here are unlikely to pose health risks to gulls, but in light of ongoing environmental change, monitoring should continue.

We evaluated the seasonality of diet and trophic niche of invasive signal crayfish in order to estimate the ecological role and effects on native communities of the stream ecosystem. We studied the differences in food source use between sexes, life stages and seasons using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses. To supplement stable isotope analyses, we evaluated food source usage using traditional stomach content analysis. We tested the hypothesis that juveniles have a different diet, showing different trophic niches, compared to adults. Results indicated that signal crayfish adult and juvenile diets mainly rely on macroinvertebrates and periphyton in summer, shifting to mostly periphyton in autumn. Although the two age classes occupied an equivalent trophic niche, juveniles showed slightly different carbon isotope values, suggesting a somewhat ontogenetic shift consistent among seasons. No significant differences were found in adult and juvenile diets between summer and autumn seasons.

BC) to expand our understanding of the different roles of rice and millets to human subsistence strategies, diachronic shift of human diets, diversity of human life histories and cultural influence (dental ablation) to human population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Carbon and nitrogen isotopic analyses of human (ribs and long bones, n = 68) and animal (n = 15) bones as well as carbonized seeds from rice and millets (n = 8) were undertaken. Human bones were directly AMS-(14) C dated. In addition, sequential sampling of 16 individuals with varied age and sex and cultural contexts for isotopic analysis was also conducted. RESULTS: The calibrated dating results (n = 27) indicate that there existed two periods of occupation at the site, ~2500-2200 BC and ~2200-1900 BC. Moderate high δ(15) N values were found in the crops. Isotopic data from bone collagen suggest that the humans mainly relied on C(3) -based animal protein and were supplemented by C(4) -based foods. This isotopic pattern is also seen in pigs. Significant difference of human δ(13) C values (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.05) between the two periods was observed. Compared to the bones, the isotopic data of human dentine serial sections show a much wider variability and higher δ(13) C values. DISCUSSION: The crops (millets and rice) were probably manured. Human individuals subsisted on rice/millet agriculture and pigs in general. In combination with the radiocarbon dates, the increase of C(3) (rice) consumption by the humans was found from the early (2500-2200 cal. BC) to late (2200-2000 cal. BC) periods, indicating the intensification of rice agriculture through time. However, four categories of human life histories during childhood are identified given different isotopic profiles of dentine sections, demonstrating that C(3) (rice) and C(4) (millets)-based foods played different roles in human lives. Even though, there were similar weaning practices among the human populations. It is surprising that human individuals with dental ablation, cultural characteristic in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River Valley, consumed more millets during childhood in the early period than those without dental ablation in the late period. Our study here provides novel insights into cultural dynamics and the interplay between rice and millets in rice-millet agricultural system during the Late Neolithic in Southwest China.",10.1002/ajpa.24259 [doi],"Chengdu Plain and human life history and millet-Rice agriculture and stable isotope (C, N) analysis and subsistence strategy",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Empirical evidence suggests that size structure prevails in aquatic ecosystems, whereas in terrestrial food webs trophic position is largely independent of body size. Compartmentalization of energy channeling according to size classes of consumers was suggested as a mechanism that underpins functioning and stability of terrestrial food webs including those belowground, but their structure has not been empirically assessed across the whole size spectrum. Here we used stable isotope analysis and metabolic regressions to describe size structure and energy use in eight belowground communities with consumers spanning 12 orders of magnitude in living body mass, from protists to earthworms. We showed a negative correlation between trophic position and body mass in invertebrate communities and a remarkable nonlinearity in community metabolism and trophic positions across all size classes. Specifically, we found that the correlation between body mass and trophic level is positive in the small-sized (protists, nematodes, arthropods below 1 μg in body mass), neutral in the medium-sized (arthropods of 1 μg to 1 mg), and negative in the large-sized consumers (large arthropods, earthworms), suggesting that these groups form compartments with different trophic organization. Based on this pattern, we propose a concept of belowground food webs being composed of (1) size-structured micro-food web driving fast energy channeling and nutrient release, for example in microbial loop; (2) arthropod macro-food web with no clear correlation between body size and trophic level, hosting soil arthropod diversity and subsidizing aboveground predators; and (3) ""trophic whales,"" sequestering energy in their large bodies and restricting its propagation to higher trophic levels in belowground food webs. The three size compartments are based on a similar set of basal resources, but contribute to different ecosystem-level functions and respond differently to variations in climate, soil characteristics and land use. We suggest that the widely used vision of resource-based energy channeling in belowground food webs can be complemented with size-based energy channeling, where ecosystem multifunctionality, biodiversity, and stability are supported by a balance across individual size compartments.",10.1002/ecy.3421 [doi],Enchytraeidae and Nematoda and biomass equivalence and body mass and community metabolism and energy channels and macrofauna and mesofauna and microfauna and protists and soil food web and stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Home range sizes were similar for the two ecotypes but highly variable among individuals. Fjord ecotype cod had significantly higher δ(13)C and δ(15)N stable isotope values than North Sea ecotype cod, suggesting they exploited different food niches.

We explored the influence of climate on stem growth and stable isotopes for Polylepis tarapacana Philipi, the world's highest elevation tree species, which is found only in the South American Altiplano. We developed tree-ring width index (RWI), oxygen (δ18O) and carbon (δ13C) chronologies for the last 60 years at four P. tarapacana stands located above 4400 m in elevation, along a 500 km latitude aridity gradient. Total annual precipitation decreased from 300 to 200 mm from the northern to the southern sites. We used RWI as a proxy of wood formation (carbon sink) and isotopic tree-ring signatures as proxies of leaf-level gas exchange processes (carbon source). We found distinct climatic conditions regulating carbon sink processes along the gradient. Current growing-season temperature regulated RWI at northern-wetter sites, while prior growing-season precipitation determined RWI at arid southern sites. This suggests that the relative importance of temperature to precipitation in regulating tree growth is driven by site water availability. By contrast, warm and dry growing seasons resulted in enriched tree-ring δ13C and δ18O at all study sites, suggesting that similar climate conditions control carbon-source processes along the gradient. Site-level δ13C and δ18O chronologies were significantly and positively related at all sites, with the strongest relationships among the southern drier stands. This indicates an overall regulation of intercellular carbon dioxide via stomatal conductance for the entire P. tarapacana network, with greater stomatal control when aridity increases. This manuscript also highlights a coupling (decoupling) between physiological processes at leaf level and wood formation as a function of similarities (differences) in their climatic sensitivity.

We analyzed stable isotope ratios in skin and fatty acid signatures in blubber samples of whales, as well as in seven potential prey species, and diet was quantitatively assessed using Bayesian isotopic models. An abrupt change in fin whale dietary niche coincided with a decrease in biomass of their predominant prey, Arctic krill (Thysanoessa spp.). This dietary niche widening toward generalist diets occurred in nearly 60% of sampled individuals. The fin whale population, typically composed of specialists of either krill or lipid-rich pelagic fishes, shifted toward one composed either of krill specialists or true generalists feeding on various zooplankton and fish prey. This change likely reduced intraspecific competition.

We used (13)C-labeled biphenyl in contaminated soils and traced the flow of pollutant-derived carbon into active cells using single-cell analyses and protein-stable isotope probing. The detection of (13)C-enriched proteins linked biphenyl biodegradation to the uncultured Alphaproteobacteria clade UBA11222, which we found to host a distinctive biphenyl dioxygenase gene widely retrieved from contaminated environments. The same approach indicated the capacity of Azoarcus species to oxidize biphenyl and suggested similar metabolic abilities for species of Rugosibacter. Biphenyl oxidation would thus represent formerly unrecognized ecological functions of both genera.

We combined the leaf stable dual isotopic signatures of carbon (δ13C) and oxygen (δ18O) with related instantaneous gas exchange performance to determine the effects of O3 dose on the net photosynthetic rate (An), stomatal conductance (gs) and intrinsic WUE (iWUE = An/gs) in four tree species (one being a hybrid) exposed to five O3 levels. The iWUE declined for each step increase in O3 level, reflecting progressive loss of the coupling between leaf carbon gain and water loss. In ambient compared with charcoal-filtered air, the decreased iWUE was associated with reductions in both An and gs (i.e., decreased δ13C and increased δ18O). In elevated O3 treatments, however, the iWUE declines were caused by reduced An at constant or increased gs. The results show that the dual isotope approach provides a robust way to gather time-integrated information on how O3 pollution affects leaf gas exchange.

While many sharks are opportunistic predators, some exhibit prey selectivity, putting them at higher risk compared to species with greater trophic plasticity. In the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), Clupeids and Sciaenids comprise 69% of blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) diets, which is consequential considering potential responses of these prey groups to disturbance and over harvesting. We assessed if blacktips exhibit selectivity for Clupeids and Sciaenids in the western GOM based on stomach contents from sharks in coastal Texas. Clupeids comprised <2% of diets, while striped mullet (Mugil cephalus) and red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) comprised >70% of identifiable prey. Ontogenetic shifts from smaller (Clupeids, small Sciaenids) to larger, higher trophic level (Ariidae, Elasmobranchii) prey fits our understanding of foraging among coastal sharks, and suggests our regional understanding of blacktip trophic ecology may be limited by the sizes of sampled sharks. Observed increases in blacktip densities coupled with declines in prey (Mugilids, Sciaenids) is concerning if blacktips have limited diet plasticity.

Metal concentrations varied largely in the study areas and were lower in macroalgae than in sediments. Localized peaks of Pb and Zn in sediments were observed in the central coastal sites as probable byproducts of mining activity transported downstream. By contrast, Cr and Ni concentrations were high in all sampling sites, thus potentially representing hazardous elements for marine biota. Overall, macroalgal δ(15)N coupled with metal analysis in macroalgae and sediments was useful for identifying the main sources of pollution in these highly anthropized coastal areas.

Despite increasing environmental concerns regarding nutrient and organic matter-rich effluents, little is known on the effects on adjacent estuarine and coastal food webs. To assess the impact and fate of anthropogenic nitrogen released from aquaculture facilities, we studied water quality and nitrogen (N) flow across an estuarine food web in an estuary in Hainan, China, using nitrogen stable isotopes (δ(15)N). We found higher δ(15)N values of ammonium, nitrate and suspended matter in the pond-covered inner estuary than further upstream, suggesting a strong influence of untreated pond effluents, which had a high δ(15)N (ammonium: ~16‰, nitrate: ~7‰, suspended matter: ~8‰). Fish and benthic invertebrates of the inner estuary had a higher δ(15)N than consumers further upstream and in similar aquaculture-free estuaries elsewhere, most likely due to direct or indirect uptake of (15)N-enriched aquaculture effluents by phytoplankton and benthic algae. A major part of the artisanal catches from the estuary consists of small-size fish which is used as feed in the local aquaculture. Thus, estuarine fish incorporating aquaculture-effluent based food web signals are harvested and recycled as feed in aquaculture facilities, whose effluents sustain this local food web. The δ(15)N being at the high end of the global range on all trophic levels indicates an anthropogenic nitrogen loop in which some portion of the reactive nitrogen initially introduced into aquaculture ponds is continuously recycled and affects the estuarine food web. This recycling also indicates a shortcut in the otherwise inefficient nitrogen sink function of estuaries. Therefore, in areas with large-scale coastal aquaculture like in China and SE Asia the effect of reactive nitrogen from aquaculture sources on the performance of coastal ecosystems may be larger than previously thought.",S0048-9697(20)37614-2 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144083 [doi],Anthropogenic nitrogen and Aquaculture and China and Food web and Hainan and Nitrogen stable isotopes and Nutrient cycling and Shrimp ponds and Trash fish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A notable example is shallow lakes where human-induced eutrophication or water level fluctuation may result in a switch from a clear-water, macrophyte-dominated state to a turbid, phytoplankton-dominated state. Yet, few investigations have described synchronous changes in biotic assemblage composition and food web framework under such a shift between alternative states. We used stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes to test the extent to which switching from macrophyte to phytoplankton dominance in Lake Gucheng, triggered by a water level increase, would alter ecosystem structure and change the basal resources supporting the food web. We found that invertebrates and fish compensated for a reduction of macrophyte and epiphyte resources by deriving more energy from the alternative pelagic energy channel, where benthic invertebrates act as crucial links between primary producers and higher consumers by transporting δ(13)C-depleted pelagic algae to the benthic zone. Although consumers can respond to large shifts in energy allocation and stabilize food web dynamics through their ability to feed across multiple energy pathways, our study suggest that energy subsidies may promote trophic cascades and enhance the stability of the turbid regime.",S0048-9697(20)37173-4 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143642 [doi],Alternative states and Benthic invertebrates and Energy channels and Macrophyte-dominated and Stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deep blooms of photosynthetic bacteria, which form the suboxic/anoxic chlorophyll maximum (ACM), widespread in aquatic ecosystems, may also contribute to the local input of organic matter. Yet, the influence of the ACM on nitrogen and carbon cycling remains poorly understood. Using a suite of stable isotope tracer experiments, we examined the transformation of nitrogen and carbon under an ACM (comprising of Chlorobiaceae and Synechococcales) and a non-ACM scenario in the anoxic zone of Lake Tanganyika. We find that the ACM hosts a tight coupling of photo/litho-autotrophic and heterotrophic processes. In particular, the ACM was a hotspot of organic matter remineralization that controlled an important supply of ammonium driving a nitrification-anammox coupling, and thereby played a key role in regulating nitrogen loss in the oxygen-deficient zone.",10.1038/s41467-021-21115-5 [pii] and 21115 [pii] and 10.1038/s41467-021-21115-5 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Properly elucidating geochemical processes, quantifying contributions of natural and anthropogenic end members, and then protecting karst aquifer systems remain challenging from scientific and engineering aspects. To identify the hydrochemical processes and quantifying contributions of end members (especially, contamination end members), 49 samples were collected from cave waters (CW), artesian springs (AS), and gravity springs (GS) in a karst watershed in Guiyang, China. With increased anthropogenic contamination, the CW, AS, and GS characterized by a Ca-Mg-SO(4)(2-)-HCO(3)(-) composition often had pH and SO(4)(2-) concentrations exceeding USEPA secondary drinking water standards. That is attributed to the influence of water-rock interaction, rainfall, and anthropogenic sources (mainly, sewage and fertilizers), in agreement with the compositions of δ(34)S(SO4), δ(18)O(SO4), and (87)Sr/(86)Sr as well as the results of principal component analysis and correlation coefficients. Based on an end-member mixing model, contributions of rainfall and anthropogenic sources were 47% and 33% of GS, 52% and 41% of CW, and 58% and 35% of AS, respectively.

Although much is known about trophic transfer of MeHg in aquatic food webs at temperate latitudes in the northern hemisphere, it is unclear whether its fate is similar in biota from coastal zones of the southeastern Pacific. To assess this gap, MeHg, total Hg and food web structure (using δ(13)C and δ(15)N) were measured in marine macroinvertebrates, fishes, birds, and mammals from Patagonian fjords and the Antarctic Peninsula. Trophic magnification slopes (TMS; log MeHg versus δ(15)N) for coastal food webs of Patagonia were high when compared with studies in the northern hemisphere, and significantly higher near freshwater inputs as compared to offshore sites (0.244 vs 0.192). Similarly, in Antarctica, the site closer to glacial inputs had a significantly higher TMS than the one in the Southern Shetland Islands (0.132 vs 0.073). Composition of the food web also had an influence, as the TMS increased when mammals and seabirds were excluded (0.132-0.221) at a coastal site.

Moreover, freshwater ecosystems are often affected by alien species introductions that can modify habitats and trophic relationships. Accordingly, the threat posed by metals interacts with those by alien species, since the latter can accumulate and transfer these substances across the food web to higher trophic levels. How metals transfer within such communities is little studied. We analysed the concentration of 14 metals/metalloids (Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, Zn, hereafter 'metal(s)') of eight fish and three crustacean species co-existing in the Arno River (Central Italy), most of which were alien. To assess the pathway of contaminants within the community, we coupled metal analysis with carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis derived from the same specimens. Crustaceans showed higher metal concentration than fish, except for Cd, Hg and Se that were higher in fish. We found evidence of trophic transfer for six metals (Cd, Cr, Hg, Mg, Se, Zn). Additionally, ontogenetic differences and differences among various fish tissues (muscle, liver, and gills) were found in metals concentration. Considerable biomagnification along the trophic chain was found for Hg, while other metals were found to biodilute. Using stable isotopes and Hg as a third diet tracer, we refined the estimations of consumed preys in the diet previously reconstructed with stable isotope mixing models. Alien species reach high biomass and can both survive to and accumulate high pollutants concentrations, potentially posing a risk for their predators and humans. A combined effect of environmental filtering and increased competition may potentially contribute to the disappearance of native species with lower tolerances.",S0269-7491(20)36470-8 [pii] and 10.1016/j.envpol.2020.115781 [doi],Biomagnification and Ecotoxicology and Environmental pollution and Food web and Freshwater ecosystems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, our understanding of the role of trophic niche in microplastic ingestion is still limited. Here, we quantified the level of microplastic (700 μm to 5 mm) contamination for macroinvertebrates and fish within the Garonne river. We then used stable isotope analyses (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) to quantify trophic niches. We first demonstrated that the abundance of ingested microplastics differed between macroinvertebrates and fish and was not significantly related to microplastic pollution. We then found that microplastic characteristics (shape, color, size, and polymer composition) differ between the abiotic (surface waters and sediments) and biotic (ingested by macroinvertebrates and fish) compartments. The abundance of ingested microplastics increased with the size of organisms in both fish and macroinvertebrates and tended to increase with trophic position in macroinvertebrates only. Finally, the origin of the resources consumed by fish significantly affected the abundance of microplastics ingested. Altogether, these results suggest the absence of microplastic bioaccumulation in freshwater food webs and the dominance of direct consumption, most likely accidentally. The use of stable isotope analyses is therefore crucial to improve our understanding of microplastic ingestion by wild organisms.",10.1021/acs.est.0c06221 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such ""magic traits"" are known to be involved in most of the compelling examples of sympatric speciation. In this study, we report a possible case of sympatric speciation without magic traits. Three species of ricefish (genus Oryzias) are suggested to have diverged sympatrically within Lake Poso, an ancient lake in Sulawesi. An analysis of genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms showed that these three species are reproductively isolated from each other throughout the lake. Stable isotope analyses revealed that the three species use different food resources, which reflect differences in their feeding morphologies (gill rakers and digestive tracts) and feeding sites. Field and laboratory observations showed that O. nebulosus and O. orthognathus share a mating habitat of cobbles, where they scatter fertilized eggs, whereas this site is never used by O. nigrimas, indicating that assortative mating is partly achieved by spatial isolation. The small, less-adhesive eggs of O. nebulosus and O. orthognathus probably reflect their adaptation to spawning on cobble beaches. Laboratory mating experiments showed strong prezygotic isolation between O. nebulosus and O. orthognathus, which is achieved by strong species recognition presumably by both sexes based on species-specific mating dances and nuptial coloration. In summary, the assortative mating of O. nebulosus and O. orthognathus is probably not coupled to resource partitioning.

"Lerner, Jacob E and Forster, Ian and Hunt, Brian P V",2021,"Experimentally derived trophic enrichment and discrimination factors for Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha.",Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,"RATIONALE: Stable isotope analysis (SIA) can provide important insights into food web structure and is a widely used tool in ecological conservation and management. It has recently been augmented by compound-specific stable isotope analysis of amino acids (CSIA-AA), an innovation that can provide greater precision when analyzing trophic level and food web connectivity. The utility of SIA rests on confidence in its constituent parameters such as the trophic enrichment factor (TEF). There is increasing emphasis on the need to experimentally derive species and tissue specific TEFs for studies utilizing SIA. Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, is a species with high potential for study using SIA due to the difficulty in observing its ecology during its marine phase and the significance of the conservation consequences of recent population declines. METHODS: Bulk and amino acid-specific TEFs were determined for juvenile and adult Chinook salmon fed specific diets. Three controlled feeding studies were performed: adult salmon were fed a biofeed, juvenile salmon were fed a biofeed, and juvenile salmon were fed krill. Bulk and compound-specific stable isotope data were collected from diet samples and from salmon muscle tissue after a minimum of 8 weeks of controlled feeding. Bulk isotope signatures were measured using EA-IRMS and CSIA-AA signatures using GC/C-IRMS, allowing the TEFs to be calculated. RESULTS: The bulk isotope TEFs were higher than those predicted for similar marine organisms and averaged 3.5‰ for ∆(15) N and 1.3‰ for ∆(13) C. The TEFs derived for nitrogen isotopes of amino acids were in line with expectations for this approach: the mean value for ∆(15) N(Glu)  - ∆(15) N(Phe) was 7.06‰ and, using a multi-AA approach, the value for ∆(15) N(Trophic)  - ∆(15) N(Source) was 6.67‰. For carbon isotopes of amino acids, the derived TEFs of Iso, Leu and Phe were near 0‰, as was that of Met, supporting their use of as source amino acids in future CSIA studies. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents Chinook salmon-specific TEFs for bulk and amino acid SIA. It supports the application of future research applying SIA to the study of Chinook salmon and validates previous research on species-specific TEFs.",10.1002/rcm.9092 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding how regional-scale ocean conditions control nutrient availability and ultimately nutrient assimilation into food webs will inform how marine resources will change in response to climate. To evaluate how ocean conditions influence the assimilation of nitrogen and carbon into coastal marine food webs, we applied a novel dimension reduction analysis to a century of newly acquired molecular isotope data derived from historic harbor seal bone specimens. By measuring bulk δ(13) C and δ(15) N values of source amino acids of these top predators from 1928 to 2014, we derive indices of primary production and nitrogen resources that are assimilated into food webs. We determined coastal food webs responded to climate regimes, coastal upwelling, and freshwater discharge, yet the strength of responses to individual drivers varied across the northeast Pacific. Indices of primary production and nitrogen availability in the Gulf of Alaska were dependent on regional climate indices (i.e., North Pacific Gyre Oscillation) and upwelling. In contrast, the coastal Washington and Salish Sea food webs were associated with local indices of freshwater discharge. For some regions (eastern Bering Sea, northern Gulf of Alaska) food web-assimilated production was coupled with nitrogen sources; however, other regions demonstrated no production-nitrogen coupling (Salish Sea). Temporal patterns of environmental indices and isotopic data from Washington state varied about the long-term mean with no directional trend. Data from the Gulf of Alaska, however, showed below average harbor seal δ(13) C values and above average ocean conditions since 1975, indicating a change in primary production in recent decades. Altogether, these findings demonstrate stable isotope data can provide useful indices of nitrogen resources and phytoplankton dynamics specific to what is assimilated by food webs.",10.1111/gcb.15551 [doi],Gulf of Alaska and amino acid and climate change and compound-specific stable isotope analysis and harbor seals and northeast Pacific Ocean and primary production,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Jackson, Allyson K and Eagles-Smith, Collin A and Robinson, W Douglas",2021,Differential reliance on aquatic prey subsidies influences mercury exposure in riparian arachnids and songbirds.,Ecology and evolution,"Cross-ecosystem subsidies move substantial amounts of nutrients between ecosystems. Emergent aquatic insects are a particularly important prey source for riparian songbirds but may also move aquatic contaminants, such as mercury (Hg), to riparian food webs. While many studies focus on species that eat primarily emergent aquatic insects, we instead study riparian songbirds with flexible foraging strategies, exploiting both aquatic and terrestrial prey sources. The goal in this study is to trace reliance on aquatic prey sources and correlate it to Hg concentrations in common riparian arachnids (Families Tetragnathidae, Opiliones, and Salticidae) and songbirds (Common Yellowthroat Geothlypis trichas, Spotted Towhee Pipilo maculatus, Swainson's Thrush Catharus ustulatus, Song Sparrow Melospiza melodia, and Yellow Warbler Setophaga petechia). We used stable isotopes of δ(13)C and δ(15)N and Bayesian mixing models in MixSIAR to determine the reliance of riparian predators on aquatic prey sources. Using mixed effects models, we found that arachnid families varied in their reliance on aquatic prey sources. While songbird species varied in their reliance on aquatic prey sources, songbirds sampled earlier in the season consistently relied more on aquatic prey sources than those sampled later in the season. For both arachnids and songbirds, we found a positive correlation between the amount of the aquatic prey source in their diet and their Hg concentrations. While the seasonal pulse of aquatic prey to terrestrial ecosystems is an important source of nutrients to riparian species, our results show that aquatic prey sources are linked with higher Hg exposure. For songbirds, reliance on aquatic prey sources early in the breeding season (and subsequent higher Hg exposure) coincides with timing of egg laying and development, both of which may be impacted by Hg exposure.",ECE37549 [pii] and 10.1002/ece3.7549 [doi],aquatic contaminant and aquatic‐terrestrial subsidy and mercury and riparian songbird and stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study combines biochemical analysis with biomass density information on soft sediment taxa collected within the depositional footprint of salmon farms and at reference sites in the Marlborough Sounds, New Zealand. Distinct biochemical signatures confirmed that the flux of organic matter from salmon farms was an important subsidy for soft sediment communities. Isotopic modelling demonstrated that the proportion of biomass supported by farm-derived organic matter did not change in a consistent pattern along the 300 m gradient from each farm site, whereas the average trophic level of communities decreased with increasing proximity to farms. High variability in both the total biomass and the distribution of biomass across trophic levels occurred among sites downstream of farms and among individual farms. Consequently, estimates of basal organic matter assimilation per unit area by communities differed by several orders of magnitude among sites. Total organic matter assimilation tended to decrease with increasing proximity to farms due to a shift towards a more detrital based community. Differences in basal organic matter assimilation among farms did not appear to be directly related to local flow regime, but instead was closely linked to differences in the soft sediment community composition likely influenced by an array of anthropogenic and environmental factors. The results presented here highlight the importance of considering local variability in basal organic matter source pools, and the potential for synergistic and cumulative effects to drive changes in food web trophodynamics when assessing the impacts of aquaculture on soft sediment communities.",S0048-9697(21)00212-6 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145146 [doi],Aquaculture and Biochemical tracer and Depositional footprint and Fatty acid and Organic matter flux and Stable isotope,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We sampled invertebrates above and below a series of dams, over two years, at both downwelling and upwelling zones. In each zone, we recorded the daily temperature and flow variations, estimated the algal development, measured the available resources, and analysed carbon and nitrogen stable isotope compositions of the invertebrate community. The number of hydrological pulses were typically higher below the dams than above the dams especially during high-flow periods whereas the groundwater outlets had minor effects on invertebrate assemblages. Invertebrate abundance, richness and diversity tended to decrease below the dams. Co-inertia analysis showed that flow and temperature variations, and eutrophication explained most of the variance in the invertebrate assemblages, which comprised a higher number of resilient taxa below than above the dams. The proportions of pesticide-sensitive invertebrates were lower below the dams and ovoviviparous and more generalist taxa were prominent. We did not observe the expected CPOM decrease and FPOM increase downstream. Accordingly, the proportions of each functional feeding group were remarkably similar above and below the dams despite the long distance between the sectors (>100 kms). The diversity of basal resources used within assemblages progressively increased downstream above dams. In contrast, the diversity of resources used by organisms below the dams decreased from upstream to downstream suggesting a significant influence of flow regulation on aquatic food webs. Finally, the shorter trophic chains for the invertebrate assemblages below the dams suggests that the effects of stream regulation and eutrophication induced a simplification of food webs. To our knowledge, this study is the first to connect taxonomic and functional trait changes in response to multiple stressors with the associated modifications in isotopic niches within aquatic invertebrate assemblages. CONTEXT: Understanding how stream regulation and associated anthropogenic pressures act on aquatic assemblages and trophic niches is necessary to guide management actions. GOAL: We aimed to investigate the functional responses (traits and trophic niches) of aquatic invertebrate assemblages to stream regulation and eutrophication. METHODS: We used univariate and multivariate analyses to compare the invertebrate assemblages above and below the dams and to assess the contributions of hydrology (including groundwater supplies to the river), temperature and eutrophication to the variability in the composition of invertebrate assemblages. We also considered the relative utilization of a selected set of traits describing invertebrate resilience, resistance and specialization to address the potential functional effects of stream regulation on invertebrate assemblages. Finally, carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses allowed us to characterize the length and width of invertebrate assemblage food webs as related to the availability and diversity of basal resources. RESULTS: Invertebrate abundance and richness generally decreased below the dams, with the highest impacts on insect taxa. Co-inertia analysis showed that stream regulation and eutrophication were main drivers of the aquatic invertebrate assemblages. The analysis separated the sites above and below the dams according to flow and temperature variation, whereas eutrophication appeared as a secondary stressor that separated the sites within each sector. Furthermore, the series of dams resulted in (i) a higher proportion of resilient (e.g., multivoltine) and resistant (ovoviviparous) taxa and a majority of generalists in assemblages below dams, (ii) an impact on the classical dynamics of CPOM (decrease) and FPOM (increase) sources from upstream to downstream, and (iii) a reduction in the diversity of resource use and in the trophic chain length of invertebrate assemblages below dams. The cooler and less oxygenated upwelling zones had lower invertebrate abundance; however, contrary to our expectation, the variation in the groundwater supply did not affect the composition of epigean invertebrate assemblages. CONCLUSION: This study provides insights about the impacts of flow regime alteration and eutrophication on food webs that may have been caused by regulation of permanent streams. To our knowledge, this is the first to connect taxonomic and functional trait changes in response to multiple stressors with the associated modifications in energy fluxes in aquatic invertebrate assemblages. This study suggests that bed stability, which is associated with a reduction in channel mobility below the dams and with moderate eutrophication, may provide the shelter and resources that can locally favour invertebrate assemblage dynamics and lessen the effects of flow regulation. In addition, the study suggests that the biological trait-based approach and isotope analysis are complementary approaches for addressing ecosystem functioning. The relative utilization of traits indicates the functional potential of aquatic invertebrate assemblages to face multiple stressors whereas isotope analysis is an expression of the actual effect of the stressors on the trophic structure of aquatic invertebrate assemblages.",S0048-9697(21)00127-3 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145061 [doi],Aquatic food web and Benthic invertebrates and Biological traits and Stream regulation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To meet growing demand, we must find ecologically responsible means to control disease and promote crop yields. The root-associated microbiome can aid plants with disease suppression, abiotic stress relief, and nutrient bioavailability. The aim of the present work was to profile the community of bacteria, fungi, and archaea associated with the wheat rhizosphere and root endosphere in different conditions. We also aimed to use (13)CO(2) stable isotope probing (SIP) to identify microbes within the root compartments that were capable of utilising host-derived carbon. RESULTS: Metabarcoding revealed that community composition shifted significantly for bacteria, fungi, and archaea across compartments. This shift was most pronounced for bacteria and fungi, while we observed weaker selection on the ammonia oxidising archaea-dominated archaeal community. Across multiple soil types we found that soil inoculum was a significant driver of endosphere community composition, however, several bacterial families were identified as core enriched taxa in all soil conditions. The most abundant of these were Streptomycetaceae and Burkholderiaceae. Moreover, as the plants senesce, both families were reduced in abundance, indicating that input from the living plant was required to maintain their abundance in the endosphere. Stable isotope probing showed that bacterial taxa within the Burkholderiaceae family, among other core enriched taxa such as Pseudomonadaceae, were able to use root exudates, but Streptomycetaceae were not. CONCLUSIONS: The consistent enrichment of Streptomycetaceae and Burkholderiaceae within the endosphere, and their reduced abundance after developmental senescence, indicated a significant role for these families within the wheat root microbiome. While Streptomycetaceae did not utilise root exudates in the rhizosphere, we provide evidence that Pseudomonadaceae and Burkholderiaceae family taxa are recruited to the wheat root community via root exudates. This deeper understanding crop microbiome formation will enable researchers to characterise these interactions further, and possibly contribute to ecologically responsible methods for yield improvement and biocontrol in the future.",10.1186/s40793-021-00381-2 [pii] and 381 [pii] and 10.1186/s40793-021-00381-2 [doi],Archaea and Endosphere and Exudate and Isotope and Metabarcoding and Microbiome and Root and Senescence and Streptomyces and Wheat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stilbonematinae are coated by thiotrophic Gammaproteobacteria. As these nematodes migrate through the redox zone, their ectosymbionts experience varying oxygen concentrations. However, nothing is known about how these variations affect their physiology. Here, by applying omics, Raman microspectroscopy, and stable isotope labeling, we investigated the effect of oxygen on ""Candidatus Thiosymbion oneisti."" Unexpectedly, sulfur oxidation genes were upregulated in anoxic relative to oxic conditions, but carbon fixation genes and incorporation of (13)C-labeled bicarbonate were not. Instead, several genes involved in carbon fixation were upregulated under oxic conditions, together with genes involved in organic carbon assimilation, polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, and urea utilization. Furthermore, in the presence of oxygen, stress-related genes were upregulated together with vitamin biosynthesis genes likely necessary to withstand oxidative stress, and the symbiont appeared to proliferate less. Based on its physiological response to oxygen, we propose that ""Ca. T. oneisti"" may exploit anaerobic sulfur oxidation coupled to denitrification to proliferate in anoxic sand. However, the ectosymbiont would still profit from the oxygen available in superficial sand, as the energy-efficient aerobic respiration would facilitate carbon and nitrogen assimilation. IMPORTANCE Chemoautotrophic endosymbionts are famous for exploiting sulfur oxidization to feed marine organisms with fixed carbon. However, the physiology of thiotrophic bacteria thriving on the surface of animals (ectosymbionts) is less understood. One longstanding hypothesis posits that attachment to animals that migrate between reduced and oxic environments would boost sulfur oxidation, as the ectosymbionts would alternatively access sulfide and oxygen, the most favorable electron acceptor. Here, we investigated the effect of oxygen on the physiology of ""Candidatus Thiosymbion oneisti,"" a gammaproteobacterium which lives attached to marine nematodes inhabiting shallow-water sand. Surprisingly, sulfur oxidation genes were upregulated under anoxic relative to oxic conditions. Furthermore, under anoxia, the ectosymbiont appeared to be less stressed and to proliferate more. We propose that animal-mediated access to oxygen, rather than enhancing sulfur oxidation, would facilitate assimilation of carbon and nitrogen by the ectosymbiont.",mSystems01186-20 [pii] and 10.1128/mSystems.01186-20 [doi],Gammaproteobacteria and Thiosymbion and anoxia and chemosynthesis and sulfur oxidation and symbiosis and thiotrophic bacteria,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although this species is widely distributed throughout the world's tropical and subtropical oceanic waters, like many deep-water species, it remains very poorly understood due to its mesopelagic distribution. We used a suite of biochemical tracers, including stable isotope analysis (SIA), fatty acid analysis (FAA), and environmental DNA (eDNA), to investigate the trophic ecology of this species in the Central Pacific around Hawaii. We found that large epipelagic prey constituted a relatively minor part of the overall diet. Surprisingly, small micronektonic and forage species (meso- and epipelagic) are the most important prey group for Cookiecutter sharks across the studied size range (17-43 cm total length), with larger mesopelagic species or species that exhibit diel vertical migration also being important prey. These results were consistent across all the tracer techniques employed. Our results indicate that Cookiecutter sharks play a unique role in pelagic food webs, feeding on prey ranging from the largest apex predators to small, low trophic level species, in particular those that overlap with the depth distribution of the sharks throughout the diel cycle. We also found evidence of a potential shift in diet and/or habitat with size and season. Environmental DNA metabarcoding revealed new prey items for Cookiecutter sharks while also demonstrating that eDNA can be used to identify recent prey in stomachs frozen for extended periods. Integrating across chemical tracers is a powerful tool for investigating the ecology of elusive and difficult to study species, such as meso- and bathypelagic chondrichthyans, and can increase the amount of information gained from small sample sizes. Better resolving the foraging ecology of these mesopelagic predators is critical for effective conservation and management of these taxa and ecosystems, which are intrinsically vulnerable to overfishing and exploitation.",10.1038/s41598-021-89903-z [pii] and 89903 [pii] and 10.1038/s41598-021-89903-z [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the general assumption is that M and N scale linearly (on log-log axes), nonlinearity is regularly observed in natural systems, and is theorized to be driven by nonlinear scaling of trophic level (TL) with M resulting in the rapid transfer of energy to consumers in certain size classes. We tested this hypothesis with data from 31 stream food webs. We predicted that allochthonous subsidies higher in the web results in nonlinear M-TL relationships and systematic abundance peaks in macroinvertebrate and fish size classes (latter containing salmonids), that exploit terrestrial plant material and terrestrial invertebrates, respectively. Indeed, both M-N and M-TL significantly deviated from linear relationships and the observed curvature in M-TL scaling was inversely related to that observed in M-N relationships. Systemic peaks in M-N, and troughs in M-TL occurred in size classes dominated by generalist invertebrates, and brown trout. Our study reveals how allochthonous resources entering high in the web systematically shape community size structure and demonstrates the relevance of a generalized metabolic scaling model for understanding patterns of energy transfer in energetically 'open' food webs.",rsbl20200798 [pii] and 10.1098/rsbl.2020.0798 [doi],allometric scaling and body size and food webs and secondary structure and stable isotopes and streams,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But the capacity for species to alter their trophic niches in response to global change, and the ways they do so when able, remain largely unknown. Here we examine food webs in three long-term and large-scale experiments to test how resource availability and nutritional requirements interact to determine an organism's trophic niche in the context of one of the largest global trends in land use-the rise in bioenergy production. We use carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses to characterize arthropod food webs across three biofuel crops representing a gradient in plant resource richness (corn monocultures, fields dominated by native switchgrass and restored prairie), and to quantify changes in the trophic niche of a widespread generalist ant species across habitats. In doing so, we measure the effects of basal resource richness on food chain length, niche breadth and trophic position. We frame our results in the context of two hypotheses that explain variation in trophic niche-the niche variation hypothesis which emphasizes the importance of resource diversity and ecological opportunity, and the optimal diet hypothesis which emphasizes dietary constraints and the availability of optimal resources. Increasing plant richness lengthened food chains by 10%-20% compared to monocultures. Niche breadths of generalist ants did not vary with resource richness, suggesting they were limited by optimal diet requirements and constraints rather than by ecological opportunity. The ants instead responded to changes in plant richness by shifting their estimated trophic position. In resource-poor monocultures, the ants were top predators, sharing a trophic position with predatory spiders. In resource-rich environments, in contrast, the ants were omnivores, relying on a mix of animal prey and plant-based resources. In addition to highlighting novel ecosystem impacts of alternate bioenergy landscapes, our results suggest that niche breadth and trophic diversification depend more on the presence of optimal resources than on ecological opportunity alone.",10.1111/1365-2656.13407 [doi],Tetramorium immigrans and Formicidae and biofuels and food chains and food webs and niche breadth and stable isotopes and trophic position,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rainforest-to-pasture conversion stimulates the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The biotic methane cycle is driven by microorganisms; therefore, this study focused on active methane-cycling microorganisms and their functions across land-use types. We collected intact soil cores from three land use types (primary rainforest, pasture, and secondary rainforest) of two geographically distinct areas of the Brazilian Amazon (Santarém, Pará and Ariquemes, Rondônia) and performed DNA stable-isotope probing coupled with metagenomics to identify the active methanotrophs and methanogens. At both locations, we observed a significant change in the composition of the isotope-labeled methane-cycling microbial community across land use types, specifically an increase in the abundance and diversity of active methanogens in pastures. We conclude that a significant increase in the abundance and activity of methanogens in pasture soils could drive increased soil methane emissions. Furthermore, we found that secondary rainforests had decreased methanogenic activity similar to primary rainforests, and thus a potential to recover as methane sinks, making it conceivable for forest restoration to offset greenhouse gas emissions in the tropics.

Our results showed (1) that carbon : nutrient ratios of primary producers decreased along the eutrophication gradient, while the elemental composition of consumers remained homeostatic, and (2) that the trophic position of several omnivores and the generalist predator Notonecta decreased, while the trophic position of most other consumers remained constant.

However, some of them are subjected to mercury (Hg) contamination, resulting in the ban of human consumption of piscivorous fish. Moreover, beyond predatory fish, little information exist regarding Hg levels in other species of these ecosystems. In this context, we used a food web analytical approach to investigate Hg bioaccumulation and biomagnification in relation to the trophic structure of these four lakes. More specifically, various organisms (macrophytes, epiphyton, invertebrates and fish) were collected at the four lakes and analysed for carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes as well as for total Hg (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg). A spatial variability of bioaccumulation in organisms was observed, particularly in carnivorous fish, with higher Hg levels being found in the two more northern lakes (median±SE: 3491 ± 474 and 1113 ± 209 ng THg.g(-1) dw in lakes HC and L, respectively) than in the southern pair (600 ± 117 and 911 ± 117 ng THg.g(-1) dw in lakes CS and PB, respectively).

Peat mining adversely affects the methanotrophs, but activity and community composition/abundances may recover after restoration. Considering that the methanotrophic activity and growth are significantly stimulated in the presence of other microorganisms, the methane-driven interaction network, encompassing methanotrophs and non-methanotrophs (i.e., methanotrophic interactome), may also be relevant in conferring community resilience. Yet, little is known of the response and recovery of the methanotrophic interactome to disturbances. Here, we determined the recovery of the methanotrophic interactome as inferred by a co-occurrence network analysis, comparing a pristine and restored peatland. We coupled a DNA-based stable isotope probing (SIP) approach using (13)C-CH(4) to a co-occurrence network analysis derived from the (13)C-enriched 16S rRNA gene sequences to relate the response in methanotrophic activity to the structuring of the interaction network. Methanotrophic activity and abundances recovered after peat restoration since 2000. 'Methylomonaceae' was the predominantly active methanotrophs in both peatlands, but differed in the relative abundance of Methylacidiphilaceae and Methylocystis However, bacterial community composition was distinct in both peatlands. Likewise, the methanotrophic interactome was profoundly altered in the restored peatland. Structuring of the interaction network after peat mining resulted in the loss of complexity and modularity, indicating a less connected and efficient network, which may have consequences in the event of recurring/future disturbances. Therefore, determining the response of the methane-driven interaction network, in addition to relating methanotrophic activity to community composition/abundances, provided a more comprehensive understanding of the resilience of the methanotrophs.Importance The resilience and recovery of microorganisms from disturbances are often determined with regard to their activity and community composition/abundances. Rarely has the response of the network of interacting microorganisms been considered, despite accumulating evidence showing that microbial interaction modulates community functioning. Comparing the methane-driven interaction network of a pristine and restored peatland, our findings revealed that the metabolically active microorganisms were less connected and formed less modular 'hubs' in the restored peatland, indicative of a less complex network which may have consequences with recurring disturbances and environmental changes. This also suggests that the resilience and full recovery in the methanotrophic activity and abundances do not reflect on the interaction network. Therefore, it is relevant to consider the interaction-induced response, in addition to documenting changes in activity and community composition/abundances, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the resilience of microorganisms to disturbances.",AEM.02355-20 [pii] and 02355-20 [pii] and 10.1128/AEM.02355-20 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biological sciences,"Seasonal resource pulses can have enormous impacts on species interactions. In marine ecosystems, air-breathing predators often drive their prey to deeper waters. However, it is unclear how ephemeral resource pulses such as near-surface phytoplankton blooms alter the vertical trade-off between predation avoidance and resource availability in consumers, and how these changes cascade to the diving behaviour of top predators. We integrated data on Weddell seal diving behaviour, diet stable isotopes, feeding success and mass gain to examine shifts in vertical foraging throughout ice break-out and the resulting phytoplankton bloom each year. We also tested hypotheses about the likely location of phytoplankton bloom origination (advected or produced in situ where seals foraged) based on sea ice break-out phenology and advection rates from several locations within 150 km of the seal colony. In early summer, seals foraged at deeper depths resulting in lower feeding rates and mass gain. As sea ice extent decreased throughout the summer, seals foraged at shallower depths and benefited from more efficient energy intake. Changes in diving depth were not due to seasonal shifts in seal diets or horizontal space use and instead may reflect a change in the vertical distribution of prey. Correspondence between the timing of seal shallowing and the resource pulse was variable from year to year and could not be readily explained by our existing understanding of the ocean and ice dynamics. Phytoplankton advection occurred faster than ice break-out, and seal dive shallowing occurred substantially earlier than local break-out. While there remains much to be learned about the marine ecosystem, it appears that an increase in prey abundance and accessibility via shallower distributions during the resource pulse could synchronize life-history phenology across trophic levels in this high-latitude ecosystem.",rspb20202817 [pii] and 10.1098/rspb.2020.2817 [doi],climate change and consumption and phenology and predation and seasonality and trade-off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, mesic-adapted Paederus beetles can survive over prolonged periods under dry field conditions, suggesting that these beetles adopt an array of water conservation mechanisms. We investigated the water balance mechanisms of field-collected Paederus adults over a 14-month sampling period. We also assessed their nutritional adaptations by performing a stable isotope analysis to examine their diet. The water loss rate (WLR) of the beetles was significantly associated with the rice crop cycle and saturation deficit. The cuticular permeability (CP) of adult beetles was maintained at < 30 µg cm(-2)h(-1) mmHg(-1); however, CP increased significantly with the WLR. This result indicates that CP might play a minor role in reducing excessive water loss in beetles. The beetles' body water content and percentage total body water content increased when the WLR was high. Trehalose, glucose, and glycogen did not appear to play a central role in enhancing the water reserves in the insects. The body lipid content ranged from 0.22 ± 0.06 to 0.87 ± 0.07 mg and was negatively associated with the WLR. This association indicates that the increase in internal metabolic water was mediated by lipid catabolism. Stable isotope analysis results revealed that the Paederus beetles shifted their diet to carbohydrate-rich plants when the saturation deficit increased and the associated WLR reached its peak; otherwise, they consumed a high amount of staple carbohydrate-poor herbivore prey.

"Dominguez Almela, Victoria and South, Josie and Britton, J Robert",2021,Predicting the competitive interactions and trophic niche consequences of a globally invasive fish with threatened native species.,The Journal of animal ecology,"Novel trophic interactions between invasive and native species potentially increase levels of interspecific competition in the receiving environment. However, theory on the trophic impacts of invasive fauna on native competitors is ambiguous, as while increased interspecific competition can result in the species having constricted and diverged trophic niches, the species might instead increase their niche sizes, especially in omnivorous species. The competitive interactions between an omnivorous invasive fish, common carp Cyprinus carpio, and a tropically analogous native and threatened fish, crucian carp Carassius carassius, were tested using comparative functional responses (CFRs). A natural pond experiment then presented the species in allopatry and sympatry, determining the changes in their trophic (isotopic) niche sizes and positions over 4 years. These predictive approaches were complemented by assessing their trophic relationships in wild populations. Comparative functional responses revealed that compared to crucian carp, carp had a significantly higher maximum consumption rate. Coupled with a previous cohabitation growth study, these results predicted that competition between the species is asymmetric, with carp the superior competitor. The pond experiment used stable isotope metrics to quantify shifts in the trophic (isotopic) niche sizes of the fishes. In allopatry, the isotopic niches of the two species were similar sized and diverged. Conversely, in sympatry, carp isotopic niches were always considerably larger than those of crucian carp and were strongly partitioned. Sympatric crucian carp had larger isotopic niches than allopatric conspecifics, a likely response to asymmetric competition from carp. However, carp isotopic niches were also larger in sympatry than allopatry. In the wild populations, the carp isotopic niches were always larger than crucian carp niches, and were highly divergent. The superior competitive abilities of carp predicted in aquaria experiments were considered to be a process involved in sympatric crucian carp having larger isotopic niches than in allopatry. However, as sympatric carp also had larger niches than in allopatry, this suggests other ecological processes were also likely to be involved, such as those relating to fish prey resources.

To address these issues, stable-isotope-probing coupled with metagenomics and molecular ecological network analyses were first used to investigate the phenanthrene rhizoremediation by three different prairie grasses in this study. All rhizospheres exhibited a significant increase in phenanthrene removal and markedly modified the diversity of phenanthrene degraders by increasing their populations and interactions with other microbes. Of all the active phenanthrene degraders, Marinobacter and Enterobacteriaceae dominated in the bare and switchgrass rhizosphere respectively; Achromobacter was markedly enriched in ryegrass and tall fescue rhizospheres. Metagenomes of (13) C-DNA illustrated several complete pathways of phenanthrene degradation for each rhizosphere, which clearly explained their unique rhizoremediation mechanisms. Additionally, propanoate and inositol phosphate of carbohydrates were identified as the dominant factors that drove PAH rhizoremediation by strengthening the ecological networks of soil microbial communities. This was verified by the results of rhizospheric and non-rhizospheric treatments supplemented with these two substances, further confirming their key roles in PAH removal and in situ PAH rhizoremediation. Our study offers novel insights into the mechanisms of in situ rhizoremediation at PAH-contaminated sites.",10.1111/1462-2920.15790 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How these disturbances drive changes in the trophic structure of native food webs through time is poorly understood. Here, we quantify trophic disruption in freshwater food webs to invasion by an apex fish predator, lake trout, using an extensive stable isotope dataset across a natural gradient of uninvaded and invaded lakes in the northern Rocky Mountains, USA. Lake trout invasion increased fish diet variability (trophic dispersion), displaced native fishes from their reference diets (trophic displacement), and reorganized macroinvertebrate communities, indicating strong food web disruption. Trophic dispersion was greatest 25 to 50 y after colonization and dissipated as food webs stabilized in later stages of invasion (>50 y). For the native apex predator, bull trout, trophic dispersion preceded trophic displacement, leading to their functional loss in late-invasion food webs. Our results demonstrate how invasive species progressively disrupt native food webs via trophic dispersion and displacement, ultimately yielding biological communities strongly divergent from those in uninvaded ecosystems.",2102179118 [pii] and 202102179 [pii] and 10.1073/pnas.2102179118 [doi],bull trout and food web and invasive species and lake trout and stable isotope,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The trophic level values (TLs) were less than 3 in all the groups, indicating simple structure of food chain. With the increasing δ(15)N value, THg and MeHg were significantly biomagnified in the mollusks and fish but not in the crustaceans. In addition, the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of MeHg were higher than inorganic mercury (IHg) in the aquatic food chain.

Restoration efforts are enhanced by reintroducing naturally occurring ecosystem processes, including disturbances that may impact species characteristics such as niche position or niche size. In grasslands, grazing and fire affect plant diversity and habitat complexity, which potentially influence insect dietary behaviors and thus their contributions to functions like seed and arthropod predation. Using carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes, we characterized variation in the dietary niche of six ground beetle species (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in response to grazing by reintroduced bison and prescribed fire disturbances in twenty tallgrass prairies. Management disturbances did not affect activity density for most beetle species and mean trophic position was mostly unaffected. However, five of six species exhibited increased trophic niche area and breadth with disturbances, indicating a switch to a more generalist diet that incorporated a wider range of food items. The combination of bison and fire impacts may increase vegetation patchiness and heterogeneity, driving these diet changes. Morphological traits and microhabitat preferences might mediate response to disturbances and the resulting heterogeneity. Combining prescribed fire and grazing, which increases plant diversity and vegetation structural diversity, may help beetle communities establish over time and support the ecological functions to which these insects contribute.",6322363 [pii] and 10.1093/ee/nvab065 [doi],ecosystem restoration and grazing and prescribed fire and stable isotope analysis and tallgrass prairie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Caohai Lake, an important karst wetland in southwestern China, karst surface water and groundwater are important recharge water sources, and nitrates flow into the wetland along with the surface water and groundwater, degrading the wetland water quality. Therefore, identifying the sources of nitrate in the surface water and groundwater in the Caohai catchment is of great significance to the protection of the wetland water environment. In this study, the nitrate concentrations, hydrochemistry and multiple stable isotope ratios (δ(18)O-H(2)O, δD-H(2)O, δ(15)N-NO(3)(-) and δ(18)O-NO(3)(-)) were used to identify the sources and fate of the NO(3)(-) in the groundwater and inflowing rivers around the Caohai wetland. The results showed that the NO(3)(-) concentrations in the groundwater samples from the southern side exceeded the WHO limit during the wet season, while other samples did not exceed the limit. The mean concentrations of NO(3)(-) in groundwater were higher than those in the inflowing river water, and NO(3)(-) concentrations decreased in the order of wet season>dry season>normal season in the groundwater and inflowing rivers. The hydrochemistry and multiple isotope ratios suggest that the nitrate transformation was dominated by nitrification processes, while denitrification had an influence on the transformation of NO(3)(-) (as evidenced by isotopes) in groundwater during the dry season. According to the analyses based on a stable isotope analysis in R (SIAR), sewage and manure were the main sources of NO(3)(-) in the groundwater, while sewage, manure and chemical fertilizer were the major sources of NO(3)(-) in the inflowing river water; therefore, the scientific use of farmland fertilizers and the treatment of domestic sewage should be strengthened to safeguard groundwater quality and control the NO(3)(-) concentrations in rivers.",10.1007/s11356-021-13827-4 [pii] and 10.1007/s11356-021-13827-4 [doi],Caohai wetland and Dual isotopes and Karst groundwater and Nitrate and SIAR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Paddy fields are a significant source of methane and account for 20% of global methane emissions, but the effect of electron acceptors on the methane emission process in flooded paddy fields has been poorly characterized. This study aimed to determine whether the electron acceptors ferric iron and nitrate, and biochar, acting as an electron shuttle, can regulate the AOM process in paddy soil, with or without interaction between biochar and these two electron acceptors. We also aimed to characterize which microorganisms are actively involved. Here, we added (13)C-labeled CH(4) ((13)CH(4)) into anaerobic microcosms to evaluate the role of electron acceptors by measuring the methane oxidation rate and the enrichment of (13)C-labeled CO(2) ((13)CO(2)). We then combined DNA-stable isotope probing with amplicon sequencing to study the active microorganisms. We found for the first time that, in addition to nitrate, ferric iron can also effectively promote AOM in paddy soil. However, there was no significant effect of biochar. Ferric iron-dependent AOM was mainly carried out by iron-reducing bacteria (Geobacter, Ammoniphilus and Clostridium), and nitrate-dependent AOM was mainly by nitrate-reducing bacteria (Rhodanobacter, Paenibacillus and Planococcus). Our results demonstrate that the AOM process, regulated by the electron acceptors ferric iron and nitrate, can alleviate methane emission from paddy soil.

Human exposure to MMHg occurs predominately through the consumption of fishery foods and rice in Asia, but it is challenging to quantify these two exposure sources. Here, we innovatively utilized MMHg compound-specific stable isotope analyses (MMHg-CSIA) of the hair to quantify the human MMHg sources in coastal and inland areas, where fishery foods and rice are routinely consumed. Our data showed that the fishery foods and rice end members had distinct Δ(199)Hg(MMHg) values in both coastal and inland areas. The Δ(199)Hg(MMHg) values of the human hair were comparable to those of fishery foods but not those of rice. Positive shifts in the δ(202)Hg(MMHg) values of the hair from diet were observed in the study areas. Additionally, significant differences in δ(202)Hg versus Δ(199)Hg were detected between MMHg and inorganic Hg (IHg) in the human hair but not in fishery foods and rice. A binary mixing model was developed to estimate the human MMHg exposures from fishery foods and rice using Δ(199)Hg(MMHg) data. The model results suggested that human MMHg exposures were dominated (>80%) by fishery food consumption and were less affected by rice consumption in both the coastal and inland areas. This study demonstrated that the MMHg-CSIA method can provide unique information for tracking human MMHg exposure sources by excluding the deviations from dietary surveys, individual MMHg absorption/demethylation efficiencies, and the confounding effects of IHg.",10.1021/acs.est.1c01771 [doi],fishery food and human hair and isotope and monomethylmercury and rice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stable light isotope analysis provides a means of assessing their diet, but diet-to-tissue discrimination factors have yet to be established for the species. METHODS: Isotope ratio ((15) N/(14) N and (13) C/(12) C expressed as δ(15) N and δ(13) C) analyses of scutes, claws, and blood of farmed crocodiles of different sizes were compared with the isotope values of their lifelong diet, which comprises chickens from a single supplier. RESULTS: Systematic size dependence in the diet-to-tissue discrimination factors for scute collagen, scute keratin, and claw keratin is described in regression relationships against the snout to vent length. Fixed values are presented for erythrocytes and blood plasma because blood was not sampled from juveniles. CONCLUSIONS: The diet-to-tissue discrimination factors help assess the diet of wild crocodiles. The diet of crocodiles from Lake Flag Boshielo shows a clear ontogenic shift, as has been seen in other studies, and the results strongly indicate a dependence on the terrestrial food web rather than a fish diet.

Estuarine crocodiles in Australia are a large carnivore conservation success story, with the population having extensively recovered from past heavy exploitation. Here, we explored if dietary changes had accompanied this large population recovery by comparing the isotopes δ(13)C and δ(15)N in bones of crocodiles sampled 40 to 55 years ago (small population) with bones from contemporary individuals (large population). We found that δ(13)C and δ(15)N values were significantly lower in contemporary crocodiles than in the historical cohort, inferring a shift in prey preference away from marine and into terrestrial food webs. We propose that an increase in intraspecific competition within the recovering crocodile population, alongside an increased abundance of feral ungulates occupying the floodplains, may have resulted in the crocodile population shifting to feed predominantly upon terrestrial food sources. The number of feral pigs consumed to sustain and grow crocodile biomass may help suppress pig population growth and increase the flow of terrestrially derived nutrients into aquatic ecosystems.

Here, we describe fecal bacterial and macroparasite communities and assess correlations with diet trophic level in Pacific walruses harvested during subsistence hunts by members of the Native Villages of Gambell and Savoonga on St Lawrence Island, Alaska. Fecal bacterial communities were dominated by relatively few taxa, mostly belonging to phyla Fusobacteriota and Firmicutes. Members of parasite-associated phyla Nematoda, Acanthocephala and Platyhelminthes were prevalent in our study population. We hypothesized that high versus low prey trophic level (e.g. fish versus bivalves) would result in different gut bacterial and macroparasite communities. We found that bacterial community structure correlated to diet, with nine clades enriched in walruses consuming higher-trophic-level prey. While no parasite compositional differences were found at the phylum level, the cestode genus Diphyllobothrium was more prevalent and abundant in walruses consuming higher-trophic-level prey, probably because fish are the intermediate hosts for this genus.

We conducted the first investigation of spatiotemporal trends for nine alternative halogenated flame retardants (AHFRs) and their relations with dietary variations in 128 humpback dolphins that were stranded along the northern South China Sea during 2003-2020. We detected the highest levels of seven major AHFRs in humpback dolphins compared with the results reported in cetaceans globally, indicating high AHFR contamination in coastal regions of South China. Dolphins that were stranded near urban regions generally contained higher AHFR concentrations than those that were stranded near rural areas, mirroring the environmental trends of AHFRs occurring in this area. Model-generated diet estimates suggested that humpback dolphins have reduced their consumption of high trophic-level prey in recent years, likely attributable to overfishing-induced prey decline in this region. After adjusting AHFR concentrations due to diet changes, the temporal trends of AHFR contamination in humpback dolphins were only slightly altered. Our results suggest that increasing discharges of AHFRs into the South China Sea during the 2000s and 2010s may have had a greater influence on AHFR trends in humpback dolphins than dietary shifts.",10.1021/acs.est.1c08636 [doi],cetaceans and diet shift and emerging flame retardants and spatial trends and stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we compared the two TP calculation methods and then reconsidered the evaluation of the trophic magnification factors (TMFs). Our results show that the TP(scaled) value is higher and the TMFs value is lower under the scaled Δ(15)N framework, indicating that the TMFs value under the constant Δ(15)N framework is often overestimated. We further constructed a diet proportion food web model, which shows that species with lower TP has higher contribution rate as food sources. In Xingkai Lake, the enrichment process of mercury in the food web is not strictly consistent with the diet proportion of the food web. Based on the diet proportion food web model and the mercury enrichment model, it can be found that the White shrimp (Exopalaemon modestus) is not only an important food source, but also the main source of mercury transmission in the food web.

Essential trace elements were observed to be offloaded at higher concentrations to embryos, with the exception of Zn and Ni in liver, while nonessential trace elements were unevenly distributed between maternal-embryo tissues. Observed Hg concentrations were at levels considered toxic in A. pelagicus, but the Se: Hg molar ratios in all embryonic tissues were all greater than one. A negative correlation was observed between transfer ratios and concentrations of all elements in maternal tissue, indicating the existence of a regulatory mechanism in maternal ovaries of A. pelagicus.

Many tropical regions have fast growing organisms, potentially short food chains, and few industrial point sources, suggesting low Hg baselines and low rates of trophic magnification with limited risk to people. Nevertheless, insufficient work on food-web Hg has been undertaken in the tropics and fish consumption is high in some regions. We studied Hg concentrations in fishes from floodplain lakes of the Juruá River, Amazonas, Brazil with three objectives: 1) determine rates of Hg trophic magnification, 2) assess whether Hg concentrations are high enough to impact humans eating fish, and 3) determine whether there are seasonal differences in fish Hg concentrations. A total of 377 fish-muscle samples were collected from 12 floodplain lakes during the low-water (September 2018) and falling-water (June 2019) seasons and analysed for total Hg and stable nitrogen (N) isotopes. The average trophic magnification factor (increase per trophic level) was 10.1 in the low-water season and 5.4 in the falling-water season, both well above the global average for freshwaters. This high rate of trophic magnification, coupled with higher-than-expected Hg concentrations in herbivorous species, led to high concentrations (up to 17.6 ng/g dry weight) in predatory pirarucu and piranha. Nearly 70% of all samples had Hg concentrations above the recommended human-consumption guidelines. Average concentrations were 42% higher in the low-water season than the falling-water season, but differences varied by species.

Our study aimed to investigate the effect of this supra-seasonal drought on the trophic structure of fish communities in a naturally saline shallow lake of a Ramsar wetland using stable isotope techniques. Fishes and potential basal sources were collected from the lake, during predrought conditions in 2010 and after severe drought (recovery phase; 2017). The δ(13)C and δ(15)N values of food web elements were determined and analysed using Bayesian mixing models and Bayesian Laymen metrics to establish the proportional contribution of C(3) and C(4) basal sources to the fish (consumer) diets, and examine the fish community in terms of isotopic niche and trophic structure, respectively. Fish consumers relied predominantly on C(3) basal sources in the predrought and shifted to greater reliance on C(4) basal sources, decreased isotopic niche space use and a reduction in trophic length in the recovery phase.

For example, DNA barcoding, or the identification of prey with taxon-specific DNA sequences, allows researchers to classify digested prey tissues to the species-level, while stable isotope analysis paired with Bayesian mixing models can quantify dietary contributions by comparing a consumer's isotopic values to those derived from their prey. However, DNA-based methods are currently only able to classify, but not quantify, the taxa present in a diet sample, while stable isotope analysis can only quantify dietary taxa that are identified a priori as prey isotopic values are a result of life history traits, not phylogenetic relatedness. Recently, researchers have begun to couple these techniques in dietary studies to capitalize on the reciprocal benefits and drawbacks offered by each approach, with some even integrating DNA-based results directly into Bayesian mixing models as informative priors. As the informative priors used in these models must represent known dietary compositions (e.g., percentages of prey biomasses), researchers have scaled the DNA-based frequency of occurrence of major prey groups so that their normalized frequency of occurrence sums to 100%. Unfortunately, such an approach is problematic as priors stemming from binomial, DNA-based data do not truly reflect quantitative information about the consumer's diet and may skew the posterior distribution of prey quantities as a result. Therefore, we present a novel approach to incorporate DNA-based dietary information into Bayesian stable isotope mixing models that preserves the binomial nature of DNA-based results. This approach uses community-wide frequency of occurrence or logistic regression-based estimates of prey occurrence to dictate the probability that each prey group is included in each mixing model iteration, and, in turn, the probability that each iteration's results are included in the posterior distribution of prey composition possibilities. Here, we demonstrate the utility of this method by using it to quantify the prey composition of nestling Louisiana waterthrush (Parkesia motacilla).",6604840 [pii] and 10.1093/icb/icac086 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After a pointed call for research on subsidies in the 1990s, an industry of empirical work has documented the ubiquitous role subsidies play in ecosystem structure, stability, and function. Here, we argue that physical constraints (e.g., water temperature) and species traits can govern a species' accessibility to resource subsidies, which has been largely overlooked in the subsidy literature. We examined the input of a high-quality, point-source anthropogenic subsidy (aquaculture feed) into a recipient freshwater lake food web. Using a combined bio-tracer approach, we detect a gradient in accessibility of the anthropogenic subsidy within the surrounding food web driven by the thermal preferences of three constituent species, effectively rewiring the recipient lake food web. Because aquaculture is predicted to increase significantly in coming decades to support growing human populations, and global change is altering temperature regimes, then this form of food web alteration may be expected to occur frequently. We argue that subsidy accessibility is a key characteristic of recipient food web interactions that must be considered when trying to understand the impacts of subsidies on ecosystem stability and function under continued global change.",10.1002/ecy.3817 [doi],Great Lakes and anthropogenic subsidies and biotracers and fatty acids and food web structure and net-pen aquaculture and stable isotopes and subsidy accessibility,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Demersal fish and cephalopod assemblages were studied across a network of 24 shallow subtidal stations in the bay of Saint-Brieuc for their diversity, stable isotope compositions and stomach contents. The community was composed of 21 taxa, eight species accounting for 94.4% of the total abundance. Three different assemblages were identified along bathymetric gradient and spatial patterns in fish dredging. Marine POM and SOM were the most likely bases of food webs regarding δ(13)C range displayed by fish and cephalopod without differences among assemblages. Amphipoda was the main prey item in stomachs leading to significant diet overlaps among fish species, with some variations in additional items. Sepia officinalis was characterised by a singular diet and very low dietary overlap with other species. Contrasted stable isotope values and niche overlaps among species were evidenced in the δ(13)C/δ(15)N space. Callionymus lyra and Buglossidium luteum, characterised by the widest isotopic niches, encompassed those of other species, except the singular (13)C-depleted Spondyliosoma cantharus.

We investigated how Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) modify their late winter diets in response to long-term trends and interannual variation in forage availability and accessibility. By reconstructing their diets and foraging niches over a 17-year period (1995-2012) using serum δ(13) C and δ(15) N values, we found strong support for a temporal increase in the proportions of graminoids in the diets with a concurrent decline in the contributions of mosses. This dietary shift corresponds with graminoid abundance increases in the region and was associated with increases in population density, warmer summer temperatures and more frequent rain-on-snow (ROS) in winter. In addition, the variance in isotopic niche positions, breadths, and overlaps also supported a temporal shift in the foraging niche and a dietary response to extreme ROS events. Our long-term study highlights the mechanisms by which winter and summer climate changes cascade through vegetation shifts and herbivore population dynamics to alter the foraging niche of Svalbard reindeer.

They found that the C. temensis population of the undammed river had a smaller niche width than the C. temensis population of the dammed river, despite the greater number of prey trophic levels utilized and the higher trophic position of C. temensis individuals. The results demonstrate that in both rivers there is a gradual shift in the contribution of prey fish sources to the diet of C. temensis throughout its growth, even among adult individuals.

The non-point-derived NO(3)(-) in the rivers supplying the upstream threatens the aquatic ecosystem of Taihu Lake. Here, dual-stable isotopes (δ(15)N and δ(18)O) of NO(3)(-) were applied to the Bayesian model (SIAR) for quantitative source identification of reactive nitrogen (Nr) in a mixed agricultural and urban region along the complex river network of the Yangze River delta. The results showed that the NO(3)(-) concentrations in the rivers ranged from 1.09 to 4.44 mg L(-1) and decreased from the highly urbanized areas to the lakeside rural areas. The specific isotopic characteristics of four sources (atmospheric deposition, AD; chemical fertilizer, CF; manure and sewage, MS; and soil leachate, SL) by the SIAR isotope model indicated that the MS source made the greatest contribution (46.56%) to the total NO(3)(-) load, followed by SL (27.86%), CF (23.77%), and AD (1.81%). The highly urbanized areas and the hybrid areas, which contained a mix of industrialized, populated, and agricultural areas, were identified as hotspot areas with heavy Nr pollution, responsible for spatial patterns of δ(15)N-NO(3)(-) and δ(18)O-NO(3)(-). These hotspot areas were characterized by a less well-developed sewage pipeline system with high Nr emissions from cash crops. The changes in wastewater treatment level, the agricultural production structure, and meteorological changes were the main factors of spatial variation of Nr concentration and source in the upstream Taihu Lake Basin.

Individual effects of both stressors on basal resources available to stream communities have been described, with diversion reducing detritus standing stocks and pollution increasing biomass of primary producers. However, interactive effects of both stressors on the structure and trophic basis of food webs remain unknown. We hypothesized that the interaction between both stressors increases the contribution of the green pathway in stream food webs. Given the key role of the high-quality, but less abundant, primary producers, we also hypothesized an increase in food web complexity with larger trophic diversity in the presence of water diversion and pollution. To test these hypotheses, we selected four rivers in a range of pollution subject to similar water diversion schemes, and we compared food webs upstream and downstream of the diversion. We characterized food webs by means of stable isotope analysis. Both stressors directly changed the availability of basal resources, with water diversion affecting the brown food web by decreasing detritus stocks, and pollution enhancing the green food web by promoting biofilm production. The propagation of the effects at the base of the food web to higher trophic levels differed between stressors. Water diversion had little effect on the structure of food webs, but pollution increased food chain length and trophic diversity, and reduced trophic redundancy. The effects at higher trophic levels were exacerbated when combining both stressors, as the relative contribution of biofilm to the stock of basal resources increased even further. Overall, we conclude that moderate pollution increases food web complexity and that the interaction with water abstraction seems to amplify this effect. Our study shows the importance of assessing the interaction between stressors to create predictive tools for a proper management of ecosystems.",10.1111/gcb.16026 [doi],bottom-up mechanisms and food web and food web complexity and pollution and stable isotopes and water diversion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The factors governing the exchange of plant C for fungal N, however, remain obscure. Because competition and soil resources may influence ectomycorrhizal resource movement, we performed a 10-month split-root microcosm study using Pinus muricata seedlings with Thelephora terrestris, Suillus pungens, or no ectomycorrhizal fungus, under two N concentrations in artificial soil. Fungi competed directly with roots and indirectly with each other. We used stable isotope enrichment to track plant photosynthate and fungal N. For T. terrestris, plants received N commensurate with the C given to their fungal partners. Thelephora terrestris was a superior mutualist under high-N conditions. For S. pungens, plant C and fungal N exchange were not coupled. However, in low-N conditions, plants preferentially allocated C to S. pungens rather than T. terrestris. Our results suggest that ectomycorrhizal resource transfer depends on competitive and nutritional context. Plants can exchange C for fungal N, but coupling of these resources can depend on the fungal species and soil N.

However, it is unclear how top predators will be impacted. We studied blood Hg concentrations of chick-rearing black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla (2000-2019) in Svalbard (Norway). From 2000 to 2019, Hg concentrations followed a U-shaped trend. The trophic level, inferred from nitrogen stable isotopes, and chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations better predicted Hg concentrations, with positive and U-shaped associations, respectively. As strong indicators of primary productivity, Chl a concentrations can influence production of upper trophic levels and, thus, fish community assemblage. In the early 2000s, the high Hg concentrations were likely related to a higher proportion of Arctic prey in kittiwake's diet. The gradual input of Atlantic prey in kittiwake diet could have resulted in a decrease in Hg concentrations until 2013. Then, a new shift in the prey community, added to the shrinking sea ice-associated release of MeHg in the ocean, could explain the increasing trend of Hg observed since 2014.

Methane (CH(4)) production and oxidation also contribute CO(2) to freshwaters, yet this remains largely unquantified. Flood pulse lakes and rivers in the tropics are hypothesized to receive large inputs of dissolved CO(2) and CH(4) from floodplains characterized by hypoxia and reducing conditions. We measured stable C isotopes of CO(2) and CH(4), aerobic respiration, and CH(4) production and oxidation during two flood stages in Tonle Sap Lake (Cambodia) to determine whether dissolved CO(2) in this tropical flood pulse ecosystem has a methanogenic origin. Mean CO(2) supersaturation of 11,000 ± 9,000 μatm could not be explained by aerobic respiration alone. (13)C depletion of dissolved CO(2) relative to other sources of organic and inorganic C, together with corresponding (13)C enrichment of CH(4), suggested extensive CH(4) oxidation. A stable isotope-mixing model shows that the oxidation of (13)C depleted CH(4) to CO(2) contributes between 47 and 67% of dissolved CO(2) in Tonle Sap Lake. (13)C depletion of dissolved CO(2) was correlated to independently measured rates of CH(4) production and oxidation within the water column and underlying lake sediments. However, mass balance indicates that most of this CH(4) production and oxidation occurs elsewhere, within inundated soils and other floodplain habitats.

The community was remarkably diverse in the sulfidic habitat and differed from other non-sulfidic habitats within the cave in terms of stable isotope ratios.

Variability in carbon and nitrogen isotope composition (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) among consumers can provide information on the population trophic niche and how it may change in response to environmental stress. We measured δ(13)C and δ(15)N values in primary producers and in an ecosystem engineer, the bioturbating sandprawn Kraussillichirus kraussi, in Langebaan Lagoon, South Africa, along a human disturbance gradient. Diet partitioning mixing models were coupled with isotope niche analyses and individual body condition data to investigate shifts in resource utilisation and diet plasticity from minimally to highly disturbed sites. The δ(15)N values of seagrass, Zostera capensis indicated a nutrient gradient, with the highest δ(15)N values at highly disturbed sites indicating either anthropogenic or marine nitrogen inputs. A decreasing δ(15)N signal with distance from human disturbance/mouth of lagoon was however not evident for sandprawns nor their presumed dietary sources (phytoplankton, microphytobenthos or sediment organic matter), likely because of faster isotope turnover time compared to seagrass and/or differential fractionation for sandprawns among the sites. Sandprawn isotope niche sizes varied among sites, with no trend along the disturbance gradient. The smallest niche coincided with uniform feeding on microphytobenthos according to mixing models. On an individual level, deviating isotope values from population means were correlated to better body condition, suggesting that a divergent feeding strategy is beneficial.

However, the identity and abundance of coexisting species, the prevailing environmental conditions, and the individual body size may shape the effects of interspecific interactions on species' niche width. Here we study the effects of interspecific and intraspecific interactions, lake area and altitude, and fish body size on the trophic niche width and resource use of a generalist predator, the littoral-dwelling large, sparsely rakered morph of European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus; hereafter LSR whitefish). We use stable isotope, diet and survey fishing data from 14 subarctic lakes along an environmental gradient in northern Norway. The isotopic niche width of LSR whitefish showed a humped-shaped relationship with increasing relative abundance of sympatric competitors, suggesting widest population niche at intermediate intensity of interspecific interactions. The isotopic niche width of LSR whitefish tended to decrease with increasing altitude, suggesting reduced niche in colder, less productive lakes. LSR whitefish typically shifted to a higher trophic position and increased reliance on littoral food resources with increasing body size, although between-lake differences in ontogenetic niche shifts were evident. In most lakes, LSR whitefish relied less on littoral food resources than coexisting fishes and the niche overlap between sympatric competitors was most evident among relatively large individuals (>250 mm). Individual niche variation was highest among >200 mm long LSR whitefish, which likely have escaped the predation window of sympatric predators. We demonstrate that intermediate intensity of interspecific interactions may broaden species' niche width, whereas strong competition for limited resources and high predation risk may suppress niche width in less productive environments. Acknowledging potential humped-shaped relationships between population niche width and interspecific interactions can help us understand species' responses to environmental disturbance (e.g. climate change and species invasions) as well as the driving forces of niche specialization.",10.1111/1365-2656.13611 [doi],diet selection and high-latitude lakes and individual specialization and niche expansion and ontogeny and resource competition and salmonid and trophic niche,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For approving a chemical within the EU, producers need to conduct an environmental risk assessment, which typically relies on data generated under laboratory conditions without considering the ecological and landscape context. To address this gap and add information on emerging contaminants and chemical mixtures, we analysed 30 livers of white-tailed sea eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla) from northern Germany with high resolution-mass spectrometry coupled to liquid and gas chromatography for the identification of >2400 contaminants. We then modelled the influence of trophic position (δ(15)N), habitat (δ(13)C) and landscape on chemical residues and screened for persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) properties using an in silico model to unravel mismatches between predicted PBT properties and observed exposures. Despite having generally low PBT scores, most detected contaminants were medicinal products with oxfendazole and salicylamide being most frequent. Chemicals of the Stockholm Convention such as 4,4'-DDE and PCBs were present in all samples below toxicity thresholds. Among PFAS, especially PFOS showed elevated concentrations compared to other studies. In contrast, PFCA levels were low and increased with δ(15)N, which indicated an increase with preying on piscivorous species. Among plant protection products, spiroxamine and simazine were frequently detected with increasing concentrations in agricultural landscapes. The in silico model has proven to be reliable for predicting PBT properties for most chemicals. However, chemical exposures in apex predators are complex and do not solely rely on intrinsic chemical properties but also on other factors such as ecology and landscape. We therefore recommend that ecological contexts, mixture toxicities, and chemical monitoring data should be more frequently considered in regulatory risk assessments, e.g. in a weight of evidence approach, to trigger risk management measures before adverse effects in individuals or populations start to manifest.",S0160-4120(21)00559-6 [pii] and 10.1016/j.envint.2021.106934 [doi],Baltic Sea and Birds of prey and Chemicals of emerging concern and JANUS tool and Persistent organic pollutants and Stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stable isotope analyses are a logistically simple but powerful tool for inferring trophic interactions and food web structure, but relatively few studies quantify seasonal variations in the food web structure or nutrient flux across multiple trophic levels. We determined the temporal dynamics in stable isotope compositions (carbon, nitrogen and sulphur) of a fish community from a highly seasonal, temperate estuary sampled monthly over a full annual cycle. Sulphur isotope values in fish tissues discriminated among consumers exploiting pelagic and benthic resources but showed no seasonal variation. This implied limited change in the relative consumption of pelagic and benthic resources by the fish community over the study period despite major seasonal changes in phytoplankton biomass. Conversely, carbon and nitrogen isotope values exhibited seasonality marked by the commencement of the spring phytoplankton bloom and peak chlorophyll concentration, with δ(13) C values following expected trends in phytoplankton growth physiology and variation in δ(15) N values coinciding with changes in major nitrogen sources to plankton between nitrate and ammonium. Isotope shifts in fish muscle were detected within 2 weeks of the peak spring phytoplankton bloom, suggesting a rapid trophic transfer of carbon and nitrogen along food chains within the estuarine food web during periods of high production. Therefore we caution against the assumption that temporal averaging effectively dampens isotopic variability in tissues of higher trophic-level animals in highly dynamic ecosystems, such as temperate estuaries. This work highlights how stable isotope analyses can be combined with environmental data to gain a broader understanding of ecosystem functioning, while emphasising the need for temporally appropriate sampling in stable isotope-based studies.",10.1111/jfb.15005 [doi],SIA and food web dynamics and isotope incorporation and nutrient pathways and sulphur and trophic transfer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mean δ(13)C values in teeth declined significantly over time, from -13.01 ± 0.55‰ historically to -14.41 ± 0.28‰ in 2000, while no consistent pattern was evident for δ(15)N due to high individual variability within each period. The temporal shift in isotopic niche is consistent with beluga feeding ecology changing in recent decades to a more pelagic and less isotopically diverse diet or an ecosystem wide change in isotope profiles. Mercury concentrations in modern beluga teeth were 3-5 times higher on average than those in historical beluga. These results are similar to the long-term trends of Hg and feeding ecology reported in other beluga populations and in other Arctic marine predators. Similar feeding ecology shifts across regions and species indicate a consistent increased pelagic diet response to climate change as the Arctic Ocean progressively warmed and lost sea ice. Previously, significant temporal Hg increase in beluga and other Arctic animals was attributed solely to direct inputs of anthropogenic Hg from long-range sources. Recent advances in understanding the Arctic marine Hg cycle suggest an additional, complementary possibility─increased inputs of terrestrial Hg of mixed anthropogenic-natural origin, mobilized from permafrost and other Arctic soils by climate warming. At present, it is not possible to assign relative importance to the two processes in explaining the rise of Hg concentrations in modern Arctic marine predators.",10.1021/acs.est.1c05389 [doi],beluga and carbon-13 and climate change and global change. and human activity and mercury and nitrogen-15 and stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The river continuum concept (RCC) and the riverine productivity model (RPM) predict a shift of energy supplying aquatic food webs along rivers: from terrestrial inputs in low-order streams to autochthonous production in mid-sized rivers. In Afromontane-savanna landscapes, the shifting numbers of large mammalian wildlife present a physical continuum whose ecological implications for rivers is not clearly understood. Here, we studied the influence of replacing large wildlife (mainly hippos) with livestock on the fractional contribution of C3 vegetation, C4 grasses and periphyton on macroinvertebrates in the Mara River, which is an African montane-savanna river known to receive large subsidy fluxes of terrestrial organic matter and nutrients mediated by large mammalian herbivores (LMH), both wildlife and livestock, in its middle and lower reaches. Using stable carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) isotopes, we identified spatial patterns in the fractional contribution of allochthonous organic matter from C3 and C4 plants (woody vegetation and grasses, respectively) and autochthonous energy from periphyton for macroinvertebrates at various sites of the Mara River and its tributaries. Potential energy sources and invertebrates were sampled at 80 sites spanning stream orders 1 to 7, various catchment land uses (forest, agriculture and grasslands) and different loading rates of organic matter and nutrients by LMH (livestock and wildlife, i.e., hippopotamus). The fractional contribution of different sources of energy for macroinvertebrates along the river did not follow predictions of the RCC and RPM. First, the fractional contribution of C3 and C4 carbon was not related to river order or location along the fluvial continuum but to the loading of organic matter (dung) by both wildlife and livestock. Notably, C4 carbon was important for macroinvertebrates even in large river sections inhabited by hippos. Second, even in small 1st -3rd order forested streams, periphyton was a major source of energy for macroinvertebrates, and this was fostered by livestock inputs fuelling aquatic primary production throughout the river network. Importantly, our results show that replacing wildlife (hippos) with livestock shifts river systems towards greater reliance on autochthonous sources of energy through an algae-grazer pathway as opposed to reliance on allochthonous inputs of C4 carbon through a detrital pathway.",S0048-9697(22)01545-5 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154452 [doi],Aquatic-terrestrial connectivity and C3 carbon and C4 carbon and MixSIAR models and Nutrient loading and Organic matter and Resource subsidies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) can be chronically exposed to PAEs by ingesting plastic debris, but no information is available about PAEs levels in blood, and how these concentrations are related to diet during different life stages. This paper investigated, for the first time, six PAEs in blood of 18 wild-caught Mediterranean loggerhead turtles throughout solid-phase extraction coupled with gas chromatography-ion trap/mass spectrometry. Stable isotope analyses of carbon and nitrogen were also performed to assess the resource use pattern of loggerhead turtles. DEHP (12-63 ng mL(-1)) and DBP (6-57 ng mL(-1)) were the most frequently represented PAEs, followed by DiBP, DMP, DEP and DOP. The total PAEs concentration was highest in three turtles (124-260 ng mL(-1)) whereas three other turtles had concentrations below the detection limit. PAEs were clustered in three groups according to concentration in all samples: DEHP in the first group, DBP, DEP, and DiBP in the second group, and DOP and DMP in the third group. The total phthalates concentration did not differ between large-sized (96.3 ± 86.0 ng mL(-1)) and small-sized (67.1 ± 34.2 ng mL(-1)) turtles (p < 0.001). However, DMP and DEP were found only in large-sized turtles and DiBP and DBP had higher concentrations in large-sized turtles. On the other hand, DEHP and DOP were found in both small- and large-sized turtles with similar concentrations, i.e. ~ 21.0/32.0 ng mL(-1) and ~ 7(.1)/9.9 ng mL(-1), respectively. Winsored robust models indicated that δ(13)C is a good predictor for DBP and DiBP concentrations (significant Akaike Information criterion weight, AIC(wt)). Our results indicate that blood is a good matrix to evaluate acute exposure to PAEs in marine turtles. Moreover, this approach is here suggested as a useful tool to explain the internal dose of PAEs in term of dietary habits (δ(13)C), suggesting that all marine species at high trophic levels may be particularly exposed to PAEs, despite their different dietary habitats and levels of exposure.",S0147-6513(22)00459-6 [pii] and 10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.113619 [doi],Acute exposure and Marine pollution and Mediterranean sea and Phthalates and Sea turtle and Stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Steibl, Sebastian and Gebauer, Gerhard and Laforsch, Christian",2022,Impacts on food web properties of island invertebrate communities vary between different human land uses.,The Science of the total environment,"Human land use is of growing concern for island ecosystems. Besides direct impacts on biodiversity, land uses can alter the functioning and structure of ecosystems. Central to this are impacts on food webs. The release of additional nutrients from human origin, habitat homogenization, or environmental filtering due to human land use can change the diet of individual consumer species (i.e., their trophic niches) and the distribution and overlap of trophic niches within a food web. However, it remains largely unclear whether the effects on food web properties vary between the different and predominant human land uses present on islands. Here, we investigated the impact of two dominant human land uses on small oceanic islands (i.e., urban and tourism development) and tested if and how different land uses on islands affect food web structure. To disentangle human land uses, we investigated islands, which were either privately owned by a tourist facility (i.e., exclusively tourism land use) or experienced urban development from the local population (i.e., urban land use), or remained uninhabited, serving as reference sites free of direct land use. Using stable isotope analysis, we show that isotope signature, trophic (isotopic) niches, and overall food web properties of the investigated island invertebrate communities were significantly changed under both land use regimes. While trophic diversity was reduced and trophic niche widths increased under tourism land use, the investigated food webs showed reduced trophic diversity at the food web base and a more uneven trophic niche distribution under urban land use. In summary, these findings show that different human land uses can have contrasting impacts on oceanic island food webs. As oceanic islands experience rapidly growing human land conversion, our results indicate that they may also face increasing yet unpredictable long-term changes in food web dynamics.",S0048-9697(22)01931-3 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154838 [doi],Human impact and Small island states and Stable isotope analysis and Tourism and Trophic niche and Urbanization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Siberian archaeological record evidences other critical shifts in dog foraging and diet that likely characterize Holocene dogs globally. By the Middle Holocene, body size reconstruction for Siberia dogs indicates that most were far smaller than Pleistocene wolves. This contributed to dogs' tendencies to scavenge, feed on small prey, and reduce social foraging. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of Siberian dogs reveals that their diets were more diverse than those of Pleistocene wolves. This included habitual consumption of marine and freshwater foods by the Middle Holocene and reliance on C(4) foods by the Late Holocene. Feeding on such foods and anthropogenic waste increased dogs' exposure to microbes, affected their gut microbiomes, and shaped long-term dog population history.",10.1126/sciadv.abo6493 [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a potential nematicide, EXLYM and its transformation products (TPs) may generate emerging pollutants with hazardous effects on the ecosystem. In this study, the fate of EXLYM in aqueous solutions was investigated using experimental and theoretical approaches. Laboratory-scale experiments showed that EXLYM is hydrolytically stable. Microbial processes are primarily responsible for the oxidation of sulfur in aqueous solutions. Under simulated sunlight, the t(1/2) values of EXLYM in acidic, neutral, and alkaline buffer solutions were 5.02, 3.83, and 5.55 h, respectively. Six TPs were identified using a non-target screening strategy realized by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with Q-Exactive Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry and (18)O-labeling experiments. Four of these were unambiguously confirmed using authentic standards. Reactive oxygen species scavenging experiments, (18)O-labeling experiments, and quantum-theoretical calculations suggested that EXLYM could degrade mainly through four pathways: sulfur oxidation, nucleophilic aromatic photosubstitution, C-S bond cleavage, and oxidative ring-opening.

In particular, understanding the determinants of their bioaccumulation is fundamental for risk assessment purposes. However, very few studies have addressed the combined influence of potential ecological drivers of PFAS bioaccumulation in fish such as age, sex or trophic ecology. Thus, this work aimed to fill these knowledge gaps by performing a field study in the Seine River basin (France). Composite sediment and fish (European chub, Squalius Cephalus) samples were collected from four sites along a longitudinal transect to investigate the occurrence of 36 PFAS. Sediment molecular patterns were dominated by fluorotelomer sulfonamidoalkyl betaines (i.e. 6:2 and 8:2 FTAB, 46% of ∑PFAS on average), highlighting the non-negligible contribution of PFAS of emerging concern. C(9)-C(14) perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA) and 10:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (10:2 FTSA) were detected in all fish samples. Conversely, 8:2 FTAB was detected in a few fish from the furthest downstream station only, suggesting the low bioaccessibility or the biotransformation of FTABs. ∑PFAS in fish was in the range 0.22-3.8 ng g(-1) wet weight (ww) and 11-140 ng g(-1) ww for muscle and liver, respectively. Fish collected upstream of Paris were significantly less contaminated than those collected downstream, pointing to urban and industrial inputs. The influence of trophic ecology and biometry on the interindividual variability of PFAS burden in fish was examined through analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs), with sampling site considered as a categorical variable. While the latter was highly significant, diet was also influential; carbon sources and trophic level (i.e. estimated using C and N stable isotope ratios, respectively) equally explained the variability of PFAS levels in fish.",S0269-7491(22)00379-7 [pii] and 10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119165 [doi],Bioaccumulation and Emerging contaminants and PFAS and fish and sediment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lower salt marsh (LSM) extends from the mean high tidal level to 35 cm above that level and is followed by the upper salt marsh (USM). Despite changes in the amount of allochthonous marine input and in abiotic conditions, little is known about changes in the trophic structure and used of basal resources by the soil macrofauna along marine-terrestrial boundaries. Natural variations in carbon stable isotope ratios (δ(13)C signatures) allow insight into basal resources of consumers such as marine algae, terrestrial C3 and C4 photosynthesising plants. Furthermore, variations in nitrogen stable isotope ratios (δ(15)N signatures) allow insight into the trophic position of consumers. We investigated spatial and temporal changes in stable isotope signatures in salt marsh soil macrofauna of the island of Spiekeroog, German Wadden Sea. The range of δ(15)N signatures indicated no changes in food chain length across salt marsh zones with consumers in both zones comprising primary decomposers, secondary decomposers and first order predators. However, the trophic position of individual species changed between zones, but in particular with season. Contrasting δ(15)N signatures, the range in δ(13)C signatures in the LSM was twice that in the USM indicating a wider range of resources consumed. Bayesian mixing models indicated predominant autochthonous resource use in both the LSM and USM, with the use of marine allochthonous resources never exceeding 29.6%. However, the models also indicate an increase in the use of marine resources in certain species in the LSM with no use in the USM. Overall, the results indicate that the resource use of salt marsh macrofauna varies more in space than in time, with the food web being generally based on autochthonous rather than allochthonous resources. However, there also is trophic plasticity in certain species across both temporal and spatial scales including variations in the use of allochthonous resources.

Here, we examine stream food webs in watersheds that feed into Lake Erie to determine the effects of agricultural land cover on major food web energy pathways and trophic structure. Given that higher agricultural intensity can increase nutrient runoff and reduce the riparian zone and litter in-fall into streams, we predicted that generalist fish would derive less energy from the terrestrial pathway and become more omnivorous. Consistent with these predictions, we show that both mean terrestrial energy use and trophic position of the resident top consumer, creek chub (Semotilus atromaculatus), decrease with local agricultural intensity but not with watershed-level agriculture intensity.

Our study set out to estimate diet composition in Gyps vultures informed by stable isotopes that provide a good representation of assimilated diet from local systems.We hypothesized that differences in Gyps vulture diet composition is a function of sampling location and that these vultures move between Serengeti National Park and Selous Game Reserve to forage. We also theorized that grazing ungulates are the principal items in Gyps vulture diet.Through combined linear and Bayesian modeling, diet derived from δ(13)C in Gyps vultures consisted of grazing herbivores across sites, with those in Serengeti National Park consuming higher proportions of grazing herbivores (>87%). δ(13)C differences in vulture feather subsets did not indicate shifts in vulture diet and combined with blood δ(13)C, vultures fed largely on grazers for ~159 days before they were sampled. Similarly, δ(15)N values indicated Gyps vultures fed largely on herbivores. δ(34)S ratios separated where vultures fed when the two sites were compared. δ(34)S variation in vultures across sites resulted from baseline differences in plant δ(34)S values, though it is not possible to match δ(34)S to specific locations.Our findings highlight the relevance of repeated sampling that considers tissues with varying isotopic turnover and emerging Bayesian techniques for dietary studies using stable isotopes.

The coastal waters of Jiangsu are one of the important fishing bases in China. In recent years, with the development of industry in the coastal waters of Jiangsu, heavy metal (HM) pollution in this region has become more serious. In this study, all samples (including macroalgae, bivalves, cephalopods, gastropods, crustaceans and fish) were collected in the coastal waters of Jiangsu in spring, summer and autumn. Based on the construction of the food web structure using carbon and nitrogen isotope technology, the main methods of material circulation and energy flow were quantified, and the accumulation regularity and seasonal variation characteristics of HMs in the food web were analysed. The results showed that (1) among all the trophic groups, bivalves had the highest enrichment level of HMs, while fish had the lowest. However, fish have a strong ability to enrich Hg, and the main source of Hg enrichment in the human body is edible fish, so more attention should be given to Hg concentrations in fish.

However, the effects of invasion and pollution on food webs remain largely unexplored. Here, we used stable isotopes to examine the effects of common carp Cyprinus carpio and pollution on trophic dynamics in six small reservoirs. Our results revealed that the trophic niche widths of invertebrates, vertebrates, and invasive carp did not significantly differ among reservoirs with different pollution statuses. However, we found low niche conservatism among reservoirs, suggesting that while niche width may remain consistent, there is a shift in the position of the niches in isotopic space under both pollution and invasion scenarios. Niche conservatism among reservoirs was generally higher in invertebrates, but this was also regardless of reservoir condition (i.e. presence or absence of pollution and invasion). These results suggest that invasion by species coupled with organic pollution may cause subtle yet differing effects on components of a food web (basal end-members, invertebrates and vertebrates).

It has been shown that conversion of rainforest into plantations erodes biodiversity, but further consequences for food-web structure and energetics of belowground communities remains little explored. We used a unique combination of stable isotope analysis and food-web energetics to analyze in a comprehensive way consequences of the conversion of rainforest into oil palm and rubber plantations on the structure of and channeling of energy through soil animal food webs in Sumatra, Indonesia. Across the animal groups studied, most of the taxa had lower litter-calibrated Δ(13)C values in plantations than in rainforests, suggesting that they switched to freshly-fixed plant carbon ('fast' energy channeling) in plantations from the detrital C pathway ('slow' energy channeling) in rainforests. These shifts led to changes in isotopic divergence, dispersion, evenness, and uniqueness. However, earthworms as major detritivores stayed unchanged in their trophic niche and monopolized the detrital pathway in plantations, resulting in similar energetic metrics across land-use systems. Functional diversity metrics of soil food webs were associated with reduced amount of litter, tree density, and species richness in plantations, providing guidelines on how to improve the complexity of the structure of and channeling of energy through soil food webs.

In the laboratory samples were digested with the normal protocols, subsequently analysed for heavy metals using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), while δ(15)N and δ(13)C isotopes were analysed with Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (IRMS). There were significant differences of heavy metals concentration between species of macro-algae and limpet, and metal concentration was species-specific. Spatio-temporal differences of (δ(13)C) isotope was evident, indicating a wide source of energy.

The toxic Cd, Pb, and essential metals Zn and Cu indicated possible biomagnification (BMF >1) between sites and seasons respectively.

Using stable isotope mixing models combined with gut content analysis and (137)Cs activity concentrations, this study investigated the hypothesis that an unexplored food web structure could be a contributing factor explaining the ecological half-life of (137)Cs in benthic flatfish. Benthic invertebrates and demersal fish species sampled in 2015 still showed (137)Cs activity concentrations higher than pre-accident. The mixing models of stable N and C isotopes and gut content analysis identified deposit, suspension and filter feeders to be the main flatfish food items in the benthos.

To explore the utility of coupling molecular and chemical techniques for dietary characterizations, we applied DNA metabarcoding alongside stable isotope analysis to characterize the dietary niche of breeding Louisiana waterthrush (Parkesia motacilla), a migratory songbird hypothesized to preferentially provision its offspring with pollution-intolerant, aquatic arthropod prey. While DNA metabarcoding was unable to determine if waterthrush provision aquatic and terrestrial prey in different abundances, we found that specific aquatic taxa were more likely to be detected in successive seasons than their terrestrial counterparts, thus supporting the aquatic specialization hypothesis. Our isotopic analysis added greater context to this hypothesis by concluding that breeding waterthrush provisioned Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera, two pollution-intolerant, aquatic orders, in higher quantities than other prey groups, and expanded their functional trophic niche when such prey were not abundantly provisioned. Finally, we found that the dietary characterizations from each approach were often uncorrelated, indicating that the results gleaned from a diet study can be particularly sensitive to the applied methodologies. Our findings contribute to a growing body of work indicating the importance of high-quality, aquatic habitats for both consumers and their pollution-intolerant prey, while also demonstrating how the application of multiple, laboratory-based techniques can provide insights not offered by either technique alone.",10.1111/mec.16688 [doi],DNA metabarcoding and arthropods and diet and mixing models and stable isotope analysis and trophic niche,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microorganisms play an important role in remediating V contamination by reducing more toxic and mobile vanadate (V(V)) to less toxic and mobile V(IV). In this study, DNA-stable isotope probing (SIP) coupled with metagenomic-binning was used to identify microorganisms responsible for V(V) reduction and determine potential metabolic mechanisms in cultures inoculated with a V-contaminated river sediment. Anaeromyxobacter and Geobacter spp. were identified as putative V(V)-reducing bacteria, while Methanosarcina spp. were identified as putative V(V)-reducing archaea. The bacteria may use the two nitrate reductases NarG and NapA for respiratory V(V) reduction, as has been demonstrated previously for other species. It is proposed that Methanosarcina spp. may reduce V(V) via anaerobic methane oxidation pathways (AOM-V) rather than via respiratory V(V) reduction performed by their bacterial counterparts, as indicated by the presence of genes associated with anaerobic methane oxidation coupled with metal reduction in the metagenome assembled genome (MAG) of Methanosarcina. Briefly, methane may be oxidized through the ""reverse methanogenesis"" pathway to produce electrons, which may be further captured by V(V) to promote V(V) reduction. More specially, V(V) reduction by members of Methanosarcina may be driven by electron transport (CoMS-SCoB heterodisulfide reductase (HdrDE), F(420)H(2) dehydrogenases (Fpo), and multi-heme c-type cytochrome (MHC)).

In the sub-Arctic, empirical evidence of changing prey fish communities has been documented, while less community change has been reported in the Arctic to date, suggesting current sub-Arctic conditions may be a harbinger of future Arctic conditions. Here, Indigenous partners collected tissues from subsistence-harvested ringed seals in 2018. Blubber fatty acids (FAs) and muscle stable isotopes (δ(15)N, δ(13)C) indicated dietary patterns, while measured contaminants included heavy metals (e.g., total mercury (THg)), legacy persistent organic pollutants (e.g., dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs)), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and per-/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). FA signatures are distinct between sub-Arctic and Resolute Bay seals, likely related to higher consumption of southern prey species including capelin (Mallotus villosus) in the sub-Arctic but on-going feeding on Arctic species in Resolute Bay. Sachs Harbour ringed seals show FA overlap with all locations, possibly consuming both southern and endemic Arctic species. Negative δ(13)C estimates for PFAS models suggest that more pelagic, sub-Arctic type prey (e.g., capelin) increases PFAS concentrations, whereas the reverse occurs for, e.g., THg, ΣPBDE, and ΣDDT. Inconsistent directionality of δ(15)N estimates in the models likely reflects baseline isotopic variation not trophic position differences. Adjusting for the influence of diet suggests that if Arctic ringed seal diets become more like sub-Arctic seals due to climate change, diet-driven increases may occur for newer contaminants like PFASs, but not for more legacy contaminants. Nonetheless, temporal trends studies are still needed, as are investigations into the potential confounding influence of baseline isotope variation in spatial studies of contaminants in Arctic biota.",S0269-7491(22)01322-7 [pii] and 10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120108 [doi],Fatty acids and Metals and Perfluoroalkyl substances and Persistent organic pollutants and Pinnipeds and Space-for-time substitution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lin, Dongming and Zang, Na and Zhu, Kai and Li, Gang and Chen, Xinjun",2022,Energy acquisition strategy for reproduction in a semelparous squid.,Frontiers in zoology,"BACKGROUND: Energy demand for reproduction leads to a wide diversity of foraging and life-history strategy among wild animals, linking to a common objective to maximize reproductive success. Semelparous squid species in particular can use up to 50% of the total energy intake for reproduction. However, the energy acquisition strategy for reproduction is still a controversial issue regarding whether the squid shift in diet ontogenetically. Here we used Argentinean shortfin squid (Illex argentinus) as a case study to investigate the strategy of energy acquisition for reproduction, by analyzing energy density of the squid's reproductive tissues including ovary, nidamental glands and oviduct eggs, and stable isotopes and fatty acids of the squid's ovary. RESULTS: The reproductive energy (the sum of the energy accumulated in ovary, nidamental glands and oviduct eggs) increased significantly with maturation. The ovary nitrogen stable isotopes (δ(15)N) showed a significant increase with maturation, but the increase by maturity stage was not equal to the typical enrichment of about 3‰ per trophic level. Isotopic niche width showed an increasing trend with maturation, and isotopic niche space exhibited greater overlap at advanced maturity stages. The relative amounts of 16:0, 20:5n3 and 20:4n6 in the ovary, tracing for carnivores and top predators, increased after the onset of maturation. The overall fatty acid profiles of the ovary showed significant differences among maturity stages, but obvious overlaps were found for mature squids. Mixed-effects model results revealed that reproductive energy was positively correlated with δ(15)N values. The reproductive energy was also positively related to the relative amounts of 18:0 and 20:4n6, respectively tracing for herbivores and top predators. CONCLUSIONS: Our results validate that the squid shifts to feed on higher trophic prey for reproduction as energy demand increases once maturation commences. However, the squid does not shift feeding habits at a trophic level but instead broadens prey spectrum, coupled with increasing intake of higher trophic prey items, to meet the energy demand for reproduction. Such energy acquisition strategy may be selected by the squid to maximize reproductive success by balancing energy intake and expenditure from foraging, warranting future studies that aim to clarify such strategy for reproduction among semelparous species.",10.1186/s12983-022-00473-w [pii] and 473 [pii] and 10.1186/s12983-022-00473-w [doi],Acquisition strategy and Energy demand and Reproduction and Semelparity and Squid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, because multiple biotic and abiotic drivers shape the trophic responses of predators to productivity, we often observe patterns, but not mechanisms, by which productivity drives food web structure. One way to capture mechanisms shaping trophic responses is to quantify trophic interactions among multiple trophic groups and by using complementary metrics of trophic ecology. In this study, we combine two diet-tracing methods: diet DNA and stable isotopes, for two trophic groups (top predators and intermediate predators) in both low- and high-productivity habitats to elucidate where in the food chain trophic structure shifts in response to changes in underlying ecosystem productivity. We demonstrate that while top predators show increases in isotopic trophic position (δ(15)N) with productivity, neither their isotopic niche size nor their DNA diet composition changes. Conversely, intermediate predators show clear turnover in DNA diet composition towards a more predatory prey base in high-productivity habitats. Taking this multi-trophic approach highlights how predator identity shapes responses in predator-prey interactions across environments with different underlying productivity, building predictive power for understanding the outcomes of ongoing anthropogenic change.",rsbl20220364 [pii] and 10.1098/rsbl.2022.0364 [doi],Araneae and diet DNA metabarcoding and food chain and stable isotope analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Six observations sites located in Yamakiya Village (Kawamata Town; since 2014), Tsushima Village (Namie Town, since 2015), and Tomioka Town (since 2017) were monitored. The forests consisted of artificial plantations of Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) at Yamakiya Village, Tsushima Village, and Tomioka Town. Tsushima Village also had a natural mixed forest dominated by Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora), and Tomioka Town had a young and a mature artificial plantation of Japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis obtuse). Concentrations of (137)Cs were monitored in the samples collected from the main aboveground biomass compartments, fresh litterfall, forest litter, and soil. Concentrations of exchangeable forms of (137)Cs and stable K were measured in soil samples. During the observation period, the litter radiocesium inventories at all sites decreased significantly to approximately 1% or less of the total ground deposition. Approximately 80% of the total radiocesium inventory is localized in the upper 5-cm layer of soil and there is little downward migration of radiocesium. At the sites with the longest monitoring series (Yamakiya and Tsushima), the radiocesium expectation depths and expectation mass depths were relatively constant at 2-3 cm and 5-6 kg m(-2), respectively. Aboveground biomass compartments showed similar decreasing trends in radiocesium aggregated transfer factors, T(ag), in the compartments that were exposed to atmospheric fallout in March 2011 (old foliage, small branches, and outer bark).

Evaluating Hg biomagnification in Arctic marine food webs is critical for understanding Hg dynamics and estimating exposure to understudied fish and wildlife consumed by humans. The majority of studies conducted on Hg biomagnification in the Arctic have focused on pelagic food webs. Benthic and benthopelagic food webs in Arctic marine ecosystems also support many species of subsistence and commercial importance, and data are lacking for these systems. In this study, we investigated food web structure and Hg biomagnification for the benthic, pelagic, and benthopelagic marine food webs of inner Frobisher Bay in Nunavut. Stable isotope ratios of carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N), as well as total (THg) and methyl (MeHg) mercury concentrations were measured in fish, invertebrates, and zooplankton. Biomagnification in each food web was quantified with Trophic Magnification Slopes (TMS) and Trophic Magnification Factors (TMF). The highest TMS and TMF values were exhibited by the benthopelagic food web (TMS = 0.201; TMF = 1.59), followed by the pelagic food web (TMS = 0.183; TMF = 1.52), and lastly the benthic food web (TMS = 0.079; TMF = 1.20), with δ(15)N explaining 88%, 79%, and 9% of variation in Hg concentrations, respectively. TMS and TMF values were generally low compared to other Arctic marine food webs. Results from food web structure analyses indicated that the benthic food web had the greatest trophic diversity, trophic redundancy, and largest isotopic niche area of all food webs studied. Greater food web complexity may thus result in reduced MeHg biomagnification, but further study is required.

As headwater streams are important sources of organic materials and nutrients to larger systems, this connectivity may also increase MeHg in downstream biota through direct or indirect effects of forestry on water quality or food web structure. In this study, we collected water, seston, food sources (biofilm, leaves, organic matter), five macroinvertebrate taxa and fish (slimy sculpin; Cottus cognata) at 6 sites representing different stream orders (1-5) within three river basins with different total disturbances from forestry (both harvesting and silviculture). Methylmercury levels were highest in water and some food sources from the basin with moderate disturbance (greater clearcutting but less silviculture). Water, leaves, stoneflies and fish increased in MeHg or total Hg along the river continuum in the least disturbed basin, and there were some dissipative effects of forest management on these spatial patterns. Trophic level (δ(15)N) was a significant predictor of MeHg (and total Hg in fish) within food webs across all 18 sites, and biomagnification slopes were significantly lower in the basin with moderate total disturbance but not different in the other two basins. The elevated MeHg in lower trophic levels but its reduced trophic transfer in the basin with moderate disturbance was likely due to greater inputs of sediments and of dissolved organic carbon that is more humic, as these factors are known to both increase transport of Hg to streams and its uptake in primary producers but to also decrease MeHg bioaccumulation in consumers. Overall, these results suggest that the type of disturbance from forestry affects MeHg bioaccumulation and trophic transfer in stream food webs and some longitudinal patterns along a river continuum.",S0269-7491(22)01024-7 [pii] and 10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119810 [doi],Aquatic food webs and Methylmercury and Stable nitrogen isotopes and Trophic magnification,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although it is crucial to determine its structure and function for water ecological health, MFW changes during lake melt period have not been well studied. In this study, the MFW was divided into three categories by analyzing its structure and trophic transfer efficiency using hierarchical C/N stable isotopes and eDNA sequencing techniques, including the detrital food web (DFC, 15 %), classical grazing food web (CFC, 60 %), and mixed trophic food web (MFC, 25 %). The trophic structure and type of MFW in ice-melting lakes are always in the process of succession and adaptation, which is in a relatively low trophic transfer efficiency stage under stable conditions (i.e. CFC), whereas the input of exogenous debris and organic pollutants may lead to an increase in MFW trophic transfer efficiency (i.e. MFC, DFC). The trophic transfer efficiency from the previous trophic level to protozoa and micrometazoa was 16.32 % and 20.77 % in DFC and 10.20 % and 29.43 % in MFC, respectively. Both are obviously higher than those of the CFC (11.69 % and 9.45 %, respectively). In terms of trophic structure, the community interaction and trophic cascade effect of DFC and MFC were enhanced but easily changed with environmental factors. In contrast, the core species and cascading effects of the CFC were clearer, and the MFW structure was relatively stable. Overall, this study reveals that the explosive increase in MFW trophic transfer efficiency induced by exogenous input during the lake melt period may subsequently lead to the destabilization of the microbial community structure and cause potential ecological risks. These are manifested in the absence of ecological trophic processes, the decrease in trophic structure complexity and stability, and the weakening of microecology self-adaptive regulation ability.",S0048-9697(22)03990-0 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156893 [doi],Hierarchical stable isotope and Ice-melting period lake and Microbial food web definition and Microecosystem stability and Trophic transfer efficiency quantification,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, current knowledge of the biodiversity and genetic potential of the involved microbial participants, especially syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria (SAOB), is limited due to the low abundance of these microorganisms and challenges in their isolation. The intent of this study was to enrich and identify potential SAOB. Therefore, we conducted continuous acetate feeding under high ammonia concentrations using two separate inoculum consortia of microorganisms that originated from full-scale mesophilic food waste digesters, which lasted for more than 200 days. Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon and metagenomic analyses, we observed a convergence of the experimental microbial communities during the enrichment regarding taxonomic composition and metabolic functional composition. Stable carbon isotope analyses of biogas indicated that SAO-HM was the dominant methanogenic pathway during the enrichment process. The hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanoculleus dominated the archaeal community. The enriched SAO community featured high biodiversity and metabolic functional redundancy. By analyzing the metagenome-assembled genomes, the known SAOB Syntrophaceticus schinkii and six uncultured populations were identified to have the genetic potential to perform SAO through the conventional reversed Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, while another six bacteria were found to encode the reversed Wood-Ljungdahl pathway combined with a glycine cleavage system as novel SAOB candidates. These results showed that the food waste anaerobic digesters harbor diverse SAOB and highlighted the importance of the glycine cleavage system for acetate oxidation. IMPORTANCE Syntrophic acetate oxidation to CO(2) and H(2), together with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, contributes to much of the carbon flux in the anaerobic digestion of organic wastes, especially at high ammonia concentrations. A deep understanding of the biodiversity, metabolic genetic potential, and ecology of the SAO community can help to improve biomethane production from wastes for clean energy production. Here, we enriched the SAO-HM functional guild obtained from full-scale food waste anaerobic digesters and recorded dynamic changes in community taxonomic composition and functional profiles. By reconstructing the metabolic pathways, diverse known and novel bacterial members were found to have SAO potential via the reversed Wood-Ljungdahl (WL) pathway alone, or via the reversed WL pathway with a glycine cleavage system (WLP-GCS), and those catalyzing WLP-GCS showed higher microbial abundance. This study revealed the biodiversity and metabolic functional redundancy of SAOB in full-scale anaerobic digester systems and provided inspiration for further genome-centric studies.",00339-22 [pii] and msystems.00339-22 [pii] and 10.1128/msystems.00339-22 [doi],anaerobic digestion and biodiversity and functional redundancy and metagenomic analysis and methanogenic pathway and syntrophic acetate oxidation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the ecological role of overexploited and endangered predators is essential to deciphering how their feeding behaviour influences food web dynamics. In this study, the authors investigated the feeding behaviour of the common and IUCN-listed Near Threatened (NT) thornback ray Raja clavata, using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope and stomach content analysis (SCA). It has recently suffered an 87% decline in reported catches from the Sea of Marmara within the last decade. These results show that thornback ray mainly feeds on teleost species, except in summer, with both methods showing this species changes its diet ontogenetically by SCA. This ontogenetic diet shift was at lengths 40-50 cm by changing group preferences from Crustacea to Teleostei. MixSIAR results showed that both adult and juvenile individuals of R. clavata feed mainly on the crustaceans, but the contribution of teleosts represented by Trachurus sp. was very low (<15%).

Increased access to human-associated food items may alter species' foraging behavior and diet, in turn modifying the normal microbial community of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), ultimately impacting their health. It is crucial we understand the role of dietary niche breadth and the resulting shift in the gut microbiota as urban animals navigate novel dietary resources. We combined stable isotope analysis of hair and microbiome analysis of four gut regions across the GIT to investigate the effects of urbanization on the diet and gut microbiota of two sympatric species of rodents with different dietary niches: the omnivorous large Japanese field mouse (Apodemus speciosus) and the relatively more herbivorous gray red-backed vole (Myodes rufocanus). Both species exhibited an expanded dietary niche width within the urban areas potentially attributable to novel anthropogenic foods and altered resource availability. We detected a dietary shift in which urban A. speciosus consumed more terrestrial animal protein and M. rufocanus more plant leaves and stems. Such changes in resource use may be associated with an altered gut microbial community structure. There was an increased abundance of the presumably probiotic Lactobacillus in the small intestine of urban A. speciosus and potentially pathogenic Helicobacter in the colon of M. rufocanus. Together, these results suggest that even taxonomically similar species may exhibit divergent responses to urbanization with consequences for the gut microbiota and broader ecological interactions.",ECE39216 [pii] and 10.1002/ece3.9216 [doi],artificial feeding and probiotics and rodents and sympatric species and urban ecology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Glaucous-winged gulls (Larus glaucescens) have experienced a dietary shift over the past century, from mainly marine to including more terrestrial/freshwater inputs, with unknown impacts on mercury (Hg) trends. We examined 109-year trends in total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations in glaucous-winged gull feathers (1887-1996) from the Salish Sea. Adult flank feathers had higher MeHg concentrations than immature feathers, and males head feathers had higher THg concentrations than females. Overall, we found no evidence of a trend in feather MeHg or THg concentrations over time from 1887 to 1996. In the same individuals, δ(15)N, δ(13)C, and δ(34)S declined over time in gull feathers. In comparison, egg THg concentrations declined from 1970 to 2019 in two species of cormorants, likely reflecting decreases in local Hg sources. We conclude that diet shifts through time may have countered increased Hg deposition from long-range transport in glaucous-winged gulls. The lack of Hg trends over time in glaucous-winged gull feathers provides additional support that these gulls have decreased the amount of marine forage fish in their diet.",10.1021/acs.est.1c03760 [doi],North Pacific and cormorants and food webs and glaucous-winged gulls and mercury and seabirds and stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The preliminary results highlight shifts in diet linked to ontogeny (I. oxyrinchus and H. griseus) and spatial distribution (C. carcharias) characterizing feeding behaviour in these species at individual and population level. These outcomes agree with the results of traditional stomach analyses supporting that nontraditional stable isotopes thus represent new perspectives for the study of modern and extinct shark ecology. In addition, for the first time, the Sr/Ca elemental ratios measured in H. griseus reflect sexual differences that could be interpreted in terms of spatial segregation or physiological heterogeneities.",10.1111/jfb.15211 [doi],alkaline metals and calcium and ecology and elasmobranchs and ontogeny and trophic level,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Amundsen, Per-Arne and Henriksson, Matilda and Poste, Amanda and Prati, Sebastian and Power, Michael",2023,Ecological Drivers of Mercury Bioaccumulation in Fish of a Subarctic Watercourse.,Environmental toxicology and chemistry,"Mercury (Hg) is a serious concern for aquatic ecosystems because it may biomagnify to harmful concentrations within food webs and consequently end up in humans that eat fish. However, the trophic transfer of mercury through the aquatic food web may be impacted by several factors related to network complexity and the ecology of the species present. The present study addresses the interplay between trophic ecology and mercury contamination in the fish communities of two lakes in a pollution-impacted subarctic watercourse, exploring the role of both horizontal (feeding habitat) and vertical (trophic position) food web characteristics as drivers for the Hg contamination in fish. The lakes are located in the upper and lower parts of the watercourse, with the lower site located closer to, and downstream from, the main pollution source. The lakes have complex fish communities dominated by coregonids (polymorphic whitefish and invasive vendace) and several piscivorous species. Analyses of habitat use, stomach contents, and stable isotope signatures (δ(15) N, δ(13) C) revealed similar food web structures in the two lakes except for a few differences chiefly related to ecological effects of the invasive vendace. The piscivores had higher Hg concentrations than invertebrate-feeding fish. Concentrations increased with size and age for the piscivores and vendace, whereas habitat differences were of minor importance. Most fish species showed significant differences in Hg concentrations between the lakes, the highest values typically found in the downstream site where the biomagnification rate also was higher. Mercury levels in piscivorous fish included concentrations that exceed health authorization limits, with possible negative implications for fishing and human consumption. Our findings accentuate the importance of acquiring detailed knowledge of the drivers that can magnify Hg concentrations in fish and how these may vary within and among aquatic systems, to provide a scientific basis for adequate management strategies.

We calculated the contributions of major carbon sources [macroalgae, phytoplankton, suspended particulate organic matter (POM) and substrate organic matter (SOM)]. The results showed that: 1) the δ(13)C values of the three species ranged from -21.44‰ to -15.21‰, with an average value of (-16.85±1.12)‰, while the δ(15)N values ranged from 8.32‰ to 10.96‰, with an average value of (9.69±0.66)‰. There were significant differences in carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes among the three species. 2) There was small niche overlap between O. fasciatus and S. marmoratus, indicating that the interspecific competition was not intense. There was no overlap between C. myriaster and the first two, indicating feeding differentiation. 3) The total ecotone area, corrected core ecotone area, and food source diversity of C. myriaster were the highest, indicating that it had a more generalized diet and richer food sources. 4) With Mytilus coruscus as a baseline organism, the trophic level of C. myriaster was the highest (3.38), followed by S. marmoratus (3.09), and the trophic level of O. fasciatus was the smallest (3.00). 5) Results of the stable isotope mixture model (SIAR) showed that POM was the main carbon source of the three species, contributing 57.4%, 57.9%, and 92.0% of the total, respectively.

In 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak resulted in unprecedented reduction in the human activity worldwide associated with the human lockdown. This situation opened an excellent opportunity to investigate the capability of urban wildlife to cope with this anthropopause event. Here, we investigated the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on the feeding strategies of the urban yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) population inhabiting the highly dense city of Barcelona (NE Spain). We compared the diet of chicks (through stomach content and stable isotope analyses) sampled randomly around the city of Barcelona before (2018 and 2019), during (2020) and after (2021) the COVID-19 lockdown. The results revealed that the anthropopause associated with the lockdown had an effect on the diet of this urban-dwelling predator. The diversity of prey consumed during the lockdown was lower, and consumption of urban birds (pigeons and parakeets) and marine prey (fishery discards and natural prey) decreased during the year of lockdown. Although it was not analysed, these diet changes probably were associated with variations in the availability of these resources due to the decrease in human activity during the lockdown. These results demonstrate the trophic flexibility of urban-dwelling species to cope with the changes in the availability of human-related anthropogenic resources in urban marine ecosystems.",rsos221639 [pii] and 10.1098/rsos.221639 [doi],COVID-19 and anthropopause and feeding ecology and marine predator and urban ecology and urban wildlife,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The amount of Hg released globally in the environment has increased steadily since the Industrial Revolution, resulting in growing contamination in biota. Seabirds have been extensively studied to monitor Hg contamination in the world's oceans. Multidecadal increases in seabird Hg contamination have been documented in polar, temperate and subtropical regions, whereas in tropical regions they are largely unknown. Since seabirds accumulate Hg mainly from their diet, their trophic ecology is fundamental in understanding their Hg exposure over time. Here, we used the sooty tern (Onychoprion fuscatus), the most abundant tropical seabird, as bioindicator of temporal variations in Hg transfer to marine predators in tropical ecosystems, in response to trophic changes and other potential drivers. Body feathers were sampled from 220 sooty terns, from museum specimens (n = 134) and free-living birds (n = 86) from Ascension Island, in the South Atlantic Ocean, over 145 years (1876-2021). Chemical analyses included (i) total- and methyl-Hg, and (ii) carbon (δ(1)³C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) stable isotopes, as proxies of foraging habitat and trophic position, respectively, to investigate the relationship between trophic ecology and Hg contamination over time. Despite current regulations on its global emissions, mean Hg concentrations were 58.9% higher in the 2020s (2.0 μg g(-1), n = 34) than in the 1920s (1.2 μg g(-1), n = 107). Feather Hg concentrations were negatively and positively associated with δ(1)³C and δ(15)N values, respectively. The sharp decline of 2.9 ‰ in δ(1)³C values over time indicates ecosystem-wide changes (shifting primary productivity) in the tropical South Atlantic Ocean and can help explain the observed increase in terns' feather Hg concentrations. Overall, this study provides invaluable information on how ecosystem-wide changes can increase Hg contamination of tropical marine predators and reinforces the need for long-term regulations of harmful contaminants at the global scale.",S0269-7491(23)00189-6 [pii] and 10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121187 [doi],Feathers and Hg and Museum and Sooty tern and Stable isotopes and Temporal monitoring,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study showed seasonal differences in the δ(13)C and δ(15)N values of basal resources and fish consumers in both years. At the up-site, significant differences of δ(13)C values of fish consumers were found between years, resulting from changing rainfall period, thereby causing a shift in food availability from terrigenous organic matter to periphyton.

However, the processes and sources of Hg in differing marine compartments (e.g. estuary, marine continental shelf (MCS) or pelagic area) have not been well studied, which makes it difficult to understand Hg cycling in marine ecosystems. To address this issue, the total Hg (THg) concentration, methylmercury (MeHg) concentration and stable Hg isotopes were determined in seawater and fish samples collected from differing marine compartments of the South China Sea (SCS). The results showed that the estuarine seawater exhibited substantially higher THg and MeHg concentrations than those in the MCS and pelagic seawater. Significantly negative δ(202)Hg (-1.63‰ ± 0.42‰) in estuarine seawater compared with that in pelagic seawater (-0.58‰ ± 0.08‰) may suggest watershed input and domestic sewage discharge of Hg in the estuarine compartment. The Δ(199)Hg value in estuarine fish (0.39‰ ± 0.35‰) was obviously lower than that in MCS (1.10‰ ± 0.54‰) and pelagic fish (1.15‰ ± 0.46‰), which showed that relatively little MeHg photodegradation occurred in the estuarine compartment. The Hg isotope binary mixing model based on Δ(200)Hg revealed that approximately 74% MeHg in pelagic fish is derived from atmospheric Hg(II) deposition, and over 60% MeHg in MCS fish is derived from sediments. MeHg sources for estuarine fish may be highly complex (e.g. sediment or riverine/atmospheric input) and further investigations are warranted to clarify the contribution of each source. Our study showed that Hg stable isotopes in seawater and marine fish can be used to identify the processes and sources of Hg in different marine compartments.

Both have been found to alter basal resource availability and consequently stream food webs. However, their interactive effects on trophic structure in stream food webs are unclear. Here, we manipulated light intensity and nutrient availability in three headwater streams to evaluate their effects on consumer diet composition and food web characteristics (i.e., trophic diversity and redundancy) with stable isotope analysis. Dietary analysis revealed that the relative contribution of stream periphyton to the diets of macroinvertebrates increased, while that of allochthonous resources, specifically leaf litter from the terrestrial ecosystems in the catchment, decreased in response to open canopy and nutrient enrichment in the streams. The trophic diversity also increased with the elevated light intensity and nutrient availability, while the trophic redundancy decreased, suggesting a reduced ability of the stream ecosystems to resist environmental changes. Nutrient enrichment also increased the δ(15)N ratios of periphyton and macroinvertebrates, indicating potential δ(15)N enrichment of stream benthos by nitrogen pollution.

Previous work demonstrating the negative impacts of AgNP exposure on periphyton production suggests benthic primary production could be reduced in aquatic ecosystems impacted by AgNP discharge. To evaluate the potential for AgNPs to alter benthic-pelagic coupling in aquatic ecosystems, tissue-stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen from northern pike (Esox lucius) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were measured before, during, and after the addition of AgNPs to a whole-lake ecosystem, and compared to those collected from a nearby reference lake. A shift in carbon isotope ratios toward more negative values was observed in both P. flavescens and E. lucius collected from the lake where AgNPs were added, with no shift in similar magnitude observed in E. lucius from the reference lake. Consequently, Bayesian estimates of benthic energy consumed decreased by 32% for P. flavescens and by 40% for E. lucius collected after AgNP additions relative to pre-addition estimates, greater in magnitude or opposite in direction of trends observed in our reference lake. Analyses suggest no changes in fish nitrogen isotope ratios related to AgNP additions. We hypothesize that the observed reduction in littoral energy use of fish reported here is a response to AgNP settling in littoral benthic habitats-the main habitat in lakes supporting periphyton-as AgNP has been shown elsewhere to significantly reduce the rates of periphyton production. Further, our study highlights the need to broaden the scope of risk assessments for AgNPs and other emerging contaminants prone to settling to consider habitat-specific impacts on resource utilization by organisms after their release into aquatic ecosystems.",10.1111/jfb.15526 [doi],Esocidae and Percidae and food webs and habitat de-coupling and nanoparticles and silver,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assess the impact of anthropogenic land-use on the food web architecture of an invaded community, we examine the diets of nine native and two highly invasive mammal species at different trophic levels, inhabiting different land-uses across six biogeographic regions in Tasmania, Australia. We use two complementary methods, environmental DNA metabarcoding analysis (eDNA) of faeces and stable isotope analysis (SIA) of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) in whole blood, to account for the high interindividual and temporal variability in the diets of multiple species simultaneously. eDNA showed regionalisation in the diet of smaller species, with land-use further defining dietary taxa within each region. SIA revealed that bioregion and land-use influence the δ(13)C values of all carnivore species and omnivores, whereas the δ(15)N values of these species are influenced only by land-use and not bioregion. Including multiple species showed that native rats are changing their diet in response to the presence of invasive rats, an impact that would have otherwise been attributed to land-use. Our findings demonstrate that human activities and invasive species are moulding the diets of invaded communities, raising questions about the potential impacts that dietary modifications will have on the life-history traits and the evolutionary consequences these modifications might have on the survival of native species.

Both lakes have experienced permafrost degradation in their catchments; however, West Lake has also undergone multiple underwater Mass Movement Events (MMEs; beginning in fall 2008), leading to a sustained 50-fold increase in turbidity. This provided the unique opportunity to understand the potential impacts of permafrost degradation and other climate-related effects on Hg concentrations and body condition of landlocked Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), an important sentinel species across the Circum-Arctic. Our objectives were to assess temporal trends in char Hg concentrations and to determine potential mechanisms driving the trends. There was a significant decrease in Hg concentrations in East Lake char, averaging 6.5%/year and 3.8%/year for length-adjusted and age-adjusted means, respectively, from 2008 to 2019. Conversely, in West Lake there was a significant increase, averaging 7.9%/year and 8.0%/year for length-adjusted and age-adjusted mean Hg concentrations, respectively, for 2009 to 2017 (the last year with sufficient sample size). The best predictors of length-adjusted Hg concentrations in West Lake were carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios, indicating a shift in diet including possible dietary starvation brought on by the profound increase in lake turbidity. Our study provides an example of how increasing lake turbidity, a likely consequence of climate warming in Arctic lakes, may influence fish condition and Hg concentrations.

However, few comparisons of individual behaviour type and diet exist in the wild. We tested whether behaviour type and diet covary in a protected population of Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua. Working in a no-take marine reserve, we could collect data on natural behavioural variation and diet choice with minimal anthropogenic disturbance. We inferred behaviour using acoustic telemetry and diet from stable isotope compositions (expressed as δ(13) C and δ(15) N values). We further investigated whether behaviour and diet could have survival costs. We found cod with shorter diel vertical migration distances fed at higher trophic levels. Cod δ(13) C and δ(15) N values scaled positively with body size. Neither behaviour nor diet predicted survival, indicating phenotypic diversity is maintained without survival costs for cod in a protected ecosystem. The links between diet and diel vertical migration highlight that future work is needed to understand whether the shifts in this behaviour during environmental change (e.g. fishing or climate), could lead to trophic cascades.",10.1111/1365-2656.14014 [doi],Atlantic cod and acoustic telemetry and individual trophic niche and marine reserves and stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such simplistic models can sometimes limit our understanding of ecological principles. We used a polyphagous species with a wide distribution, the brown bear (Ursus arctos), to illustrate how disparate theoretical frameworks in ecology can affect conclusions regarding ecological communities. We used stable isotope measurements (δ(13) C, δ(15) N) from hairs of individually monitored bears in Sweden and Bayesian mixing models to estimate dietary proportions of ants, moose, and three berry species to compare with other brown bear populations. We also developed three hypotheses based on predominant foraging literature, and then compared predicted diets to field estimates. Our three models assumed (1) bears forage to optimize caloric efficiency (optimum foraging model), predicting bears predominately eat berries (~70% of diet) and opportunistically feed on moose (Alces alces) and ants (Formica spp. and Camponotus spp; ~15% each); (2) bears maximize meat intake (maximizing fitness model), predicting a diet of 35%-50% moose, followed by ants (~30%), and berries (~15%); (3) bears forage to optimize macronutrient balance (macronutrient model), predicting a diet of ~22% (dry weight) or 17% metabolizable energy from proteins, with the rest made up of carbohydrates and lipids (~49% and 29% dry matter or 53% and 30% metabolizable energy, respectively). Bears primarily consumed bilberries (Vaccinium myrtillus; 50%-55%), followed by lingonberries (V. vitis-idaea; 22%-30%), crowberries (Empetrum nigrum; 8%-15%), ants (5%-8%), and moose (3%-4%). Dry matter dietary protein was lower than predicted by the maximizing fitness model and the macronutrient balancing model, but protein made up a larger proportion of the metabolizable energy than predicted. While diets most closely resembled predictions from optimal foraging theory, none of the foraging hypotheses fully described the relationship between foraging and ecological niches in brown bears. Acknowledging and broadening models based on foraging theories is more likely to foster novel discoveries and insights into the role of polyphagous species in ecosystems and we encourage this approach.",10.1002/ecy.4228 [doi],Ursus arctos and brown bear and diet and foraging theory and macronutrients and omnivore and stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Decisions to combat eutrophication in the North Sea were made in the 1980s. Despite significant improvements during recent decades, high nitrogen loads and resulting eutrophication problems remain. In this study, long-term changes in nitrogen inputs to the Elbe Estuary (Germany) were characterized based on nitrogen data provided by the Elbe River Basin Community from 1985 to 2019. Additionally, surface water samples were taken at the weir separating the river from the estuary from 2011 to 2021 to characterize dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations and nitrate stable isotope composition. The findings suggest a close coupling of river discharge with the riverine nitrogen cycle. Nitrogen loads decreased disproportionately with decreasing discharge. This decrease is due to intensified nitrogen retention in the Elbe catchment, which can double nitrogen retention compared to average discharge conditions. Phytoplankton growth was enhanced by long residence times and high light availability at low water levels. This suggests that the recent decreases in nitrogen loads in the Elbe River were not only a result of management measures in the catchment but were also amplified by a recent long-lasting drought in the catchment. Based on projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, more frequent and extensive droughts are anticipated, which may lead to future seasonal shifts to nitrate limitation in the lower Elbe River.",S0048-9697(23)05365-2 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166740 [doi],Climate change and Discharge and Eutrophication and Nitrate stable isotopes and Nitrogen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PFAS profiles of air, terrestrial invertebrates, and swallows were dominated by perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). Short-chain perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) were largely restricted to air, surface water, and sediment, and long-chain PFAAs were mainly found in aquatic invertebrates and tree swallows. PFOS, multiple long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids [perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTrDA)] and perfluorooctane sulfonamide precursors were estimated to bioaccumulate from air to tree swallows. PFOS bioaccumulated from air to terrestrial invertebrates, and PFOS, PFDA, and perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acids (FOSAAs) bioaccumulated from water to aquatic invertebrates. PFOS showed biomagnification from both terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates to tree swallows, and PFDA and FOSAAs were also biomagnified from aquatic invertebrates to tree swallows.

Using a previously-developed model (Islam 2005), we estimated that a trout farm in the vicinity released 1.4 tons of nitrogen into the river. This was comparable to an estimated total nutrient load of 2.1 tons of nitrogen for the six-month fish-rearing period based on a web-based constituent load estimator (LOADEST). A model estimate of river nitrogen concentration at the time of minimum river discharge (100 L/s) was 2.74 mg/L. Despite relatively high nitrogen loading from the farm, isotope data showed typical food web structure. Several biological groups had elevated δ(13)C or δ(15)N values, but there was limited evidence for the entry of organic matter from the trout farm into the food web, with sites above and below trout farms having inconsistent patterns in (15)N enrichment. By coupling nitrogen load modeling with stable isotope analysis we showed that stable isotopes might not be effective tracers of organic matter into food webs, depending on surrounding land use and other point sources of nutrients.

Isotopic niche partitioning and comparison of trophic levels among these species (n = 21) were investigated using stable carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) isotope analysis. Overall, δ(13)C values were highly variable among taxa, indicating that the species exploit multiple foraging habitats along a coast-open ocean gradient.

"Maitland, Bryan M and Rahel, Frank J",2023,Aquatic food web expansion and trophic redundancy along the Rocky Mountain-Great Plains ecotone.,Ecology,"Changing ecological conditions along environmental gradients influence patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. However, how networks of interacting species respond to these changes remains unclear. We quantified aquatic food webs along longitudinal stream gradients spanning the Rocky Mountain-Great Plains ecotone using community composition, functional traits, and stable isotopes. We predicted that increasing ecosystem size, productivity, and species richness along the gradient would positively influence aquatic trophic diversity (e.g., expanded vertical and horizontal trophic niche breadths). We also predicted that trophic redundancy among fish species would decrease moving downstream as species partition food resources (e.g., reduced trophic niche overlap). Consumer stable isotope data (δ(13) C and δ(15) N) revealed nonlinear changes in trophic diversity along the gradient. Invertebrate trophic diversity had a dome-shaped relationship with the gradient, strongly linked to an expanding then contracting δ(13) C range. Fish trophic diversity initially increased and then plateaued downstream, despite linearly expanding δ(13) C and δ(15) N ranges. Trophic redundancy within the fish community decreased downstream along the gradient. However, trophic redundancy also showed a nonlinear relationship with fish species richness; it initially declined, then began to increase when more than nine species were present, indicating a shift from niche partitioning to niche packing at intermediate species richness levels. This result suggests that while δ(13) C and δ(15) N ranges for fish communities increased across the gradient, niche packing within communities in the Great Plains caused overall trophic diversity to saturate. Our results demonstrate that food web structure along stream gradients reflects an interaction between factors that decrease trophic redundancy, such as increased living space and niche partitioning, versus factors that increase trophic redundancy, such as increased species richness and niche packing. Our study helps to explain how multiple mechanisms shape food web properties along longitudinal stream gradients, and where niche partitioning or niche packing may be dominant. Understanding the functional roles of organisms across similar environmental gradients in other ecosystems will be increasingly important because they determine how food webs, and thus ecosystem function, will respond to environmental change, biodiversity loss, or species invasions.",10.1002/ecy.4103 [doi],community ecology and food webs and longitudinal gradient and niche partitioning and realized trophic niche and stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, aquatic organisms and five potential food sources (leaf litter, coarse and fine particulate organic matter (CPOM and FPOM, respectively), epilithon and fish) were collected around the Shimen Realgar Mine of China. Stomach content analysis and stable nitrogen and carbon isotope analysis, combined with a new Bayesian mixing model (MixSIAR), were used to quantify diet compositions of aquatic organisms. The δ(13)C and δ(15)N values varied among fish sizes and sampling sites and were probably related to the diet shift of aquatic organisms. The MixSIAR modelling results showed that the aquatic organisms' food sources were mainly composed of FPOM (9%-68%) and epilithon (15%-65%), with leaf litter, CPOM and fish accounting for smaller proportions (2%-30%). Concentrations ranged from 0.91 to 1298 mg/kg for As, 0.01-1.30 mg/kg for Cd, 0.12-37.79 mg/kg for Pb, 0.63-1158 mg/kg for Cr, 1.22-411 mg/kg for Cu, 0.82-1772 mg/kg for Mn, 0.31-542 mg/kg for Ni and 21.84-1414 mg/kg for Zn in all the collected samples, including the aquatic organisms and the relevant food sources.

We collected soil, rice plants, aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, small wild fish, and resident songbird feathers from an Hg-contaminated rice paddy ecosystem for an analysis of stable Hg isotopes to clarify the sources of Hg and its transfer in songbirds and their prey. Significant mass-dependent fractionation (MDF, δ(202)Hg), but no mass-independent fractionation (MIF, ∆(199)Hg) occurred in the trophic transfers in terrestrial food chains. Piscivorous, granivorous, and frugivorous songbirds and aquatic invertebrates were all characterized by elevated Δ(199)Hg values. The estimated MeHg isotopic compositions obtained using linear fitting and a binary mixing model explained both the terrestrial and aquatic origins of MeHg in the terrestrial food chains. We found that MeHg from aquatic habitats is an important subsidy for terrestrial songbirds, even those that feed mainly on seeds, fruits, or cereals. The results show that MIF of the MeHg isotope is a reliable tool to reveal MeHg sources in songbirds. Because the MeHg isotopic compositions was calculated with a binary mixing model or directly estimated from the high proportions of MeHg, compound-specific isotope analysis of Hg would be more useful for the interpretation of the Hg sources, and is highly recommended for future studies.",S0048-9697(23)01836-3 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163217 [doi],Bird feather and MeHg origin and MeHg transfer and Stable Hg isotopes and Terrestrial songbirds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The northwestern Atlantic has a history of heavy fishing, and over the past century has also experienced destructive bottom fishing and harmful mobile fishing gear. After confirming that preservation solvent did not alter the nitrogen stable isotopes of preserved samples, we used museum specimens and modern samples to analyze nitrogen stable isotopes in tissues of two common demersal fishes pre-1950 (1850 to 1950) compared to 2021 to assess changes in trophic positions of coastal New England consumers over this time period. Both the mesopredator Centropristis striata (black sea bass) and the benthivore Stenotomus chrysops (scup) experienced significant declines in trophic position during this time. C. striata declined almost a full trophic level, S. chrysops declined half a trophic level, and these species are now occupying almost the same trophic position. Heavy fishing activities potentially shorten food chains, simplify trophic complexity, lessen the separation of trophic niches, and generally flatten food webs. The consequences of these within-species shifts are poorly investigated but could generate underappreciated cascading impacts on community structure and function.

One important tool for assessing organism diet is bulk stable isotope analysis. However, key parameters necessary for interpreting the temporal context of stable isotope values are lacking, especially for Arctic species. This study provides the first experimental determination of isotopic turnover (as half-life) and trophic discrimination factors (TDFs) of both δ(13) C and δ(15) N in adult polar cod muscle. Using a diet enriched in both (13) C and (15) N, we measured isotopic turnover times of 61 and 49 days for δ(13) C and δ(15) N, respectively, with metabolism accounting for >94% of the total turnover. These half-life estimates are valid for adult polar cod (>3 years) experiencing little somatic growth. We measured TDFs in our control of 2.6‰ and 3.9‰ for δ(13) C and δ(15) N, respectively, and we conclude that applying the commonly used TDF of ~1‰ for δ(13) C for adult polar cod may lead to misrepresentation of dietary carbon source, while the use of 3.8‰ for δ(15) N is appropriate. Based on these results, we recommend that studies investigating seasonal shifts in the diet of adult polar cod sample at temporal intervals of at least 60 days to account for isotopic turnover in polar cod muscle. Although isotopic equilibrium was reached by the fish in this study, it was at substantially lower isotope values than the diet. Additionally, the use of highly enriched algae in the experimental feed caused very high variability in diet isotope values which precluded accurate calculation of TDFs from the enriched fish. As a result of the challenges faced in this study, we discourage the use of highly enriched diets for similar experiments and provide recommendations to guide the design of future isotopic turnover experiments.",10.1111/jfb.15389 [doi],enrichment and fractionation and half-life and isotopic routing and stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dias, Ester and Morais, Pedro and Antunes, Carlos and Hoffman, Joel C",2023,The benthic food web connects the estuarine habitat mosaic to adjacent ecosystems.,Food webs,"Energy flows from land to sea and between pelagic and benthic environments have the potential to increase the connectivity between estuaries and adjacent ecosystems as well as among estuarine habitats. To identify such energy flows and the main trophic pathways of energy transfer in the Minho River estuary, we investigated the spatial and temporal fluctuations of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios in benthic (and their potential food sources) and epibenthic consumers. Sampling was conducted along the estuarine salinity gradient from winter to summer of 2011. We found that the carbon (δ(13)C = (13)C/(12)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N = (15)N/(14)N) stable isotope ratios of the most abundant benthic and epibenthic consumers varied along the salinity gradient. The δ(13)C values increased seaward, whereas the opposite pattern was found for the δ(15)N, especially during the summer. The stable isotope ratios revealed two trophic pathways in the Minho estuary food web. The first pathway is supported by phytoplankton and represented by filter feeders such as zooplankton and some deposit feeders, particularly amphipods and polychaetes. The second pathway is supported by detritus and composed essentially of deposit feeders, which by being consumed, allow detritus to be incorporated into higher trophic levels. Spatial and temporal feeding variations in the estuarine benthic food web are driven by hydrology and proximity to adjacent ecosystems (terrestrial, marine). During high river discharge periods, the δ(13)C(POC) (ca. -28‰) and C: N(POM) (>10) values suggested an increase of terrestrial-derived OM to the particulate OM pool, which was then used by suspension feeders. During low river discharge periods, marine intrusion increased upriver, which was reflected in benthic consumers' (13)C-enriched stable isotope values. No relationship was found between food quality (phytoplankton vs. detritus) and food chain length because the lowest and highest values were associated with freshwater and saltmarsh areas, respectively, both dominated by the detrital pathway. This study demonstrates that benthic consumers enhance the connectivity between estuaries and its adjacent ecosystems by utilizing subsidies of terrestrial and marine origin and that benthic-pelagic coupling is an important energy transfer mechanism to the benthic food web.",10.1016/j.fooweb.2023.e00282 [doi],Connectivity and Detritus and Food chain and River discharge and Stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Linhares, Bruno de Andrade and Bugoni, Leandro",2023,Seabirds subsidize terrestrial food webs and coral reefs in a tropical rat-invaded archipelago.,Ecological applications : a publication of the Ecological Society of America,"Allochthonous resource fluxes mediated by organisms crossing ecosystem boundaries may be essential for supporting the structure and function of resource-limited environments, such as tropical islands and surrounding coral reefs. However, invasive species, such as black rats, thrive on tropical islands and disrupt the natural pathways of nutrient subsidies by reducing seabird colonies. Here, we used stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon to examine the role of seabirds in subsidizing the terrestrial food webs and adjacent coral reefs in the Abrolhos Archipelago, Southwest Atlantic Ocean. By sampling invasive rats and multiple ecosystem compartments (soil, plants, grasshoppers, tarantulas, and lizards) within and outside seabird colonies, we showed that seabird subsidies led to an overall enrichment in (15) N across the food web on islands. However, contrary to other studies, δ(15) N values were consistently lower within the seabird colonies, suggesting that a higher seabird presence might produce a localized depletion in (15) N in small islands influenced by seabirds. In contrast, the nitrogen content (%N) in plants and soils was higher inside the colonies, corresponding to a higher effect of seabirds at the base of the trophic web. Among consumers, lizards and invasive rats seemed to obtain allochthonous resources from subsidized terrestrial organisms outside the colony. Inside the colony, however, they showed a more direct consumption of marine matter, suggesting that subsidies benefit these native and invasive animals both directly and indirectly. Nonetheless, in coral reefs, scleractinian corals assimilated seabird-derived nitrogen only around the two smaller and lower-elevation islands, as demonstrated by the substantially higher δ(15) N values in relation to the reference areas. This provides evidence that island morphology may influence the incorporation of seabird nutrients in coral reefs around rat-invaded islands, likely because guano lixiviation toward seawater is facilitated in small and low-elevation terrains. Overall, these results showed that seabirds affected small islands across all trophic levels within and outside colonies and that these effects spread outward to coral reefs, evidencing resiliency of seabird subsidies even within a rat-invaded archipelago. Because rats are consumers of seabird chicks and eggs, however, rat eradication could potentially benefit the terrestrial and nearshore ecosystems through increased subsides carried by seabirds.",10.1002/eap.2733 [doi],allochthonous resources and coral reefs and cross-ecosystem subsidies and ecosystem function and invasive rats and island morphology and stable isotopes and terrestrial food web and tropical archipelago,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The combination of a stomach and intestine content analysis with the use of biomarkers (i.e. fatty acids and stable isotopes) identified a clear shift in diet with increased occurrences of typical hard-substrate prey species for fish in the vicinity of the foundations and this both on the short and the long term. Despite some condition indices suggesting that the hard substrate provides increased food availability, no clear increases of overall plaice condition or fecundity were found. Samples from within the wind farm, however, contained larger fish and had a higher abundance of females compared to control areas, potentially indicating a refuge effect caused by the cessation of fisheries activities within the OWF. These results suggest that soft-sediment species can potentially benefit from the presence of an OWF, which could lead to fish production. However, more research is still needed to further elucidate the behavioral ecology of plaice within OWFs to make inferences on how they can impact fish populations on a larger spatial scale.",S0048-9697(22)07833-0 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160730 [doi],Artificial reef effect and Fish condition and North Sea and OWFs and Plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and Trophic ecology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pond-breeding amphibians can dominate aquatic animal biomass as larvae and are terrestrial prey as juveniles and adults. Thus, amphibians can be vectors of mercury exposure in both aquatic and terrestrial food webs. However, it is still unclear how mercury concentrations are affected by exogenous (e.g., habitat or diet) vs endogenous factors (e.g., catabolism during hibernation) as amphibians undergo large diet shifts and periods of fasting during ontogeny. We measured total mercury (THg), methylmercury (MeHg), and isotopic compositions (δ (13)C, δ(15)N) in boreal chorus frogs (Pseudacris maculata) across five life stages in two Colorado (USA) metapopulations. We found large differences in concentrations and percent MeHg (of THg) among life stages. Frog MeHg concentrations peaked during metamorphosis and hibernation coinciding with the most energetically demanding life cycle stages. Indeed, life history transitions involving periods of fasting coupled with high metabolic demands led to large increases in mercury concentrations. The endogenous processes of metamorphosis and hibernation resulted in MeHg bioamplification, thus decoupling it from the light isotopic proxies of diet and trophic position. These step changes are not often considered in conventional expectations of how MeHg concentrations within organisms are assessed.",10.1021/acs.est.2c04896 [doi],Anuran and Pseudacris maculata and bioaccumulation and biomagnification and boreal chorus frog and contaminant and metamorph and methylmercury and stable isotopes and tadpole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the diet of two native species, Glossogobius callidus and Gilchristella aestuaria, was assessed in the presence of two non-native species, Oreochromis mossambicus and Gambusia affinis, in irrigation ponds, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. The proportion of dietary items consumed and assimilated by the four fish species were inferred from gut contents and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis. Stable isotope analysis revealed that both G. affinis and O. mossambicus had a larger isotopic niche size than G. callidus and G. aestuaria. Although G. callidus fed on benthic resources and G. aestuaria fed on phytoplankton, gut content analysis showed that G. callidus, O. mossambicus and G. affinis fed predominantly on benthic resources, whereas G. aestuaria fed mainly on plankton resources. Considerable niche overlap corroborates the view that resource competition is a major factor shaping the composition of the four fish species.

In southern Brazil, a swamp forest on an estuarine island is used by waterbirds for breeding, providing an opportunity to investigate the potential effects of transport of matter between nutrient-rich environments. Soil, plants, invertebrates, and blood from terrestrial birds were collected and stable isotopes compared to similar organisms in a control site without heronries. Values of δ(15)N and δ(13)C from waterbirds were higher in the colony in comparison to the control site (spatial effect). The enrichment of (15)N and (13)C provided during the active colony period persisted after the breeding period, especially for δ(15)N, which was higher in all compartments (temporal effect). Moreover, the enrichment of (15)N occurred along the entire trophic chain (vertical effect) in the colony environment, including different guilds of invertebrates and land birds. The enrichment in (13)C seems to lose strength and was mostly explained by factors such as trophic guild rather than site, especially in birds. Bayesian mixture models with terrestrial vs. estuarine endpoints demonstrated that all organisms from both colony and control environments had assimilated estuarine matter. Finally, detritivorous invertebrates showed greater assimilation when compared to other guilds. This study demonstrates that adjacent nutrient-rich environments, such as palustrine forests and estuaries, are nutritionally enriched in several dimensions from nearby autochthonous subsidies that are maintained throughout the year.",10.1007/s00442-023-05377-y [pii] and 10.1007/s00442-023-05377-y [doi],Allochthonous matter and Biological vectors and Lateral transport and Stable isotopes and Trophic guilds,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microbial predation is crucial to fundamental understanding of how biological interactions drive microbiome structuring and functioning of WWTPs. However, predatory bacteria have received little attention regarding their diversity, activity, and ecological function in activated sludge, limiting the exploitation of food web interactions for wastewater microbiome engineering. Here, by using rRNA-stable isotope probing of activated sludge microbiota with (13)C-labeled prey bacteria, we uncovered diverse as-yet-uncultivated putative predatory bacteria that actively incorporated (13)C-biomass. Myxobacteria, especially Haliangium and the mle1-27 clade, were found as the dominant active predators, refreshing conventional views based on a few predatory isolates of Bdellovibrionota from WWTPs. The identified predatory bacteria showed more selective predation on prey compared with the protists dominated by ciliates, providing in situ evidence for inter-domain predation behavior divergence in activated sludge. Putative predatory bacteria were tracked over a two-year microbiome monitoring effort at a local WWTP, revealing the predominance of Myxococcota (6.5 ± 1.3%) over Bdellovibrionota (1.0 ± 0.2%) lineages. Phylogenetic analysis unveiled highly diverse myxobacteria inhabiting activated sludge and suggested a habitat filtering effect in global WWTPs. Further mining of a global activated sludge microbiome dataset revealed the prevalence of Myxococcota (5.4 ± 0.1%) species and potential impacts of myxobacterial predation on process performance.

However, in soil, the diversity of animals seems enigmatic since the soil is a rather homogeneous habitat, and soil animals are often generalist feeders. A new approach to understand soil animal diversity is the use of ecological stoichiometry. The elemental composition of animals may explain their occurrence, distribution, and density. This approach has been used before in soil macrofauna, but this study is the first to investigate soil mesofauna. Using inductively coupled plasma optic emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), we analyzed the concentration of a wide range of elements (Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P, S, Zn) in 15 soil mite taxa (Oribatida, Mesostigmata) from the litter of two different forest types (beech, spruce) in Central Europe (Germany). Additionally, the concentration of carbon and nitrogen, and their stable isotope ratios ((15)N/(14)N, (13)C/(12)C), reflecting their trophic niche, were measured. We hypothesized that (1) stoichiometry differs between mite taxa, (2) stoichiometry of mite taxa occurring in both forest types is not different, and (3) element composition is correlated to trophic level as indicated by (15)N/(14)N ratios. The results showed that stoichiometric niches of soil mite taxa differed considerably indicating that elemental composition is an important niche dimension of soil animal taxa. Further, stoichiometric niches of the studied taxa did not differ significantly between the two forest types. Calcium was negatively correlated with trophic level indicating that taxa incorporating calcium carbonate in their cuticle for defense occupy lower trophic positions in the food web. Furthermore, a positive correlation of phosphorus with trophic level indicated that taxa higher in the food web have higher energetic demand. Overall, the results indicate that ecological stoichiometry of soil animals is a promising tool for understanding their diversity and functioning.",ECE310122 [pii] and 10.1002/ece3.10122 [doi],diversity and elemental composition and mites and niche differentiation and soil animals and stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the impact of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on composition and transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) during long-distance transport and seasonal cycle is not fully understood. By using a combination of elemental, isotopic and optical techniques, as well as Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), we investigated DOM abundance and composition along the whole mainstream at highly spatial resolution in the dry and early wet seasons. Our findings showed that the concentration and flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the Yangtze River was much lower compared with other worldwide larger rivers. The distribution of δ(13)C(DOC) and higher abundance of humic-like fluorescent component and highly unsaturated and phenolics (HUPs) compound reflected a prominent contribution of allochthonous DOM. Further optical and molecular analysis revealed humic-like fluorescent components were coupled with CHO molecules and HUPs compound with higher aromatic, unsaturated, molecular weight and stable characteristics between upstream and midstream reaches. With increasing agricultural and urban land downstream, there were more heteroatomic formulae and labile aliphatic and protein-like compounds which were derived from human activities and in situ primary production. Meanwhile, DOM gradually accumulates with slow water flow and additional autochthonous organics. Weaker solar radiation and water dilution during the dry/cold season favours highly aromatic, unsaturated and oxygenated DOM compositions. Conversely, higher discharge during the wet/warm season diluted the terrestrial DOM, but warm temperatures could promote phytoplankton growth that releases labile aliphatic and protein-like DOM. Besides, chemical sulfurization, hydrogenation and oxygenation were found during molecular cycling processes.

This study assessed the bioaccumulation of mercury (total mercury, THg) in the muscle, liver, red blood cells (RBC), and plasma of pelagic and bigeye thresher sharks (Alopias pelagicus and A. superciliosus) from eastern tropical Pacific. Additionally, the concentration of methylmercury (MeHg) in muscle was also determined to assess risks for human consumption. For both species, muscle THg concentrations (4.05 ± 2.15 and 4.12 ± 1.84 μg g(-1) dry weight for pelagic and bigeye thresher shark) were higher than that in other tissues. THg concentrations for all tissues were significantly correlated with precaudal length, with higher accumulation rates after maturity in pelagic than bigeye thresher sharks, suggesting an associated dietary shift at maturation. Correlations among tissues in both species suggested similar transportation and distribution patterns in internal tissues. The δ(13)C values in muscle, RBC and plasma suggested that habitat shifts influenced Hg accumulation, whereas trophic position, estimated by δ(15)N values, had limited effects on patterns of Hg bioaccumulation. Diet shifts towards prey more cephalopods that content higher Hg than small fishes (large fishes: 1.77 μg g(-1); cephalopods: 0.66 μg g(-1) and small fishes 0.48 μg g(-1), dry weight) increased Hg accumulation rates in adult pelagic thresher sharks. Concentrations of MeHg in the muscle of both thresher shark (3.42 ± 1.68 μg g(-1) in A. pelagicus and 3.78 ± 2.13 μg g(-1) in A. superciliosus) exceeded the recommended levels for human consumption.

One of the main constituents of aquatic subsidy, the non-biting midges (Chironomidae), showed altered emergence dynamics in response to the mosquito control agent Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti). As riparian spiders depend on aquatic subsidy, they may be affected by such changes in prey availability. Thus, we conducted a field study in twelve floodplain pond mesocosms (FPMs), six were treated with Bti (2.88 × 10(9) ITU/ha, VectoBac WDG) three times, to investigate if the Bti-induced shift in chironomid emergence dynamics is reflected in their nutritional value and in the diet of riparian spiders. We measured the content of proteins, lipids, glycogen, and carbohydrates in emerged Chironomidae, and determined the stable isotope ratios of female Tetragnatha extensa, a web-building spider living in the riparian vegetation of the FPMs. We analysed the proportion of aquatic prey in spiders' diet, niche size, and trophic position. While the content of nutrients and thus the prey quality was not significantly altered by Bti, effects on the spiders' diet were observed. The trophic position of T. extensa from Bti-treated FPMs was lower compared to the control while the aquatic proportion was only minimally reduced. We assume that spiders fed more on terrestrial prey but also on other aquatic organisms such as Baetidae, whose emergence was unaffected by Bti. In contrast to the partly predaceous Chironomidae, consumption of aquatic and terrestrial primary consumers potentially explains the observed lower trophic position of spiders from Bti-treated FPMs. As prey organisms vary in their quality the suggested dietary shift could transfer previously observed effects of Bti to riparian spiders conceivably affecting their populations.

The results of our study suggested that the soil moisture strongly influenced the diversity of soil biota, with the wetter soil, having a higher organic matter content, hosting a more diverse community.

Over the past decades, the St. Lawrence marine ecosystem (Canada) has experienced major changes in its physical, chemical, and biological conditions from overfishing, acoustic and chemical pollution, climate change, and the increased abundance of some top predators. These changes have likely affected the trophodynamics of the ecosystem, and are suspected to have deleterious effects on endangered species of mammals and other components of the ecosystem, such as blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus), fin whales (B. physalus), and beluga (Delphinapterus leucas). This study examined the trophic structure of the St. Lawrence marine ecosystem, including the isotopic niche of various species, over two periods of contrasting pressures from anthropogenic and climatic stressors (1995-2003 vs. 2019-2021). Stable isotope ratios were measured in 1240 samples of 21 species of marine invertebrates, fishes, and mammals sampled during both periods. A significant change in the isotopic value and niche position between periods is observed in most of the sampled species. While the direction of change and effect size were not uniform among species, these changes confirmed that substantial modifications in community structure have occurred over time. Niche overlap decreased considerably among some of the pelagic and demersal fishes, and among whale species during the most recent period. Combined with a concomitant reduction in niche breadth in several species, these observations suggested that resource sharing was limited among these species.

Using SIP, we successfully identified the active toluene degrader Pigmentiphaga, the single cells of which were subsequently sorted and isolated by RACS. We further successfully assembled the genome of Pigmentiphaga based on the metagenomic sequencing of (13)C-DNA and genomic sequencing of sorted cells, which was confirmed by gyrB gene comparison and average nucleotide identity determination. Additionally, the genotypes and phenotypes of this degrader were directly linked at the single-cell level, and its complete toluene metabolic pathways in petroleum-contaminated soil were reconstructed.

We exploited red wood ant nests markedly differing in size as natural experiments to quantify the drivers of trophic structure and food chain length of their symbiont arthropod communities. Using stable isotopes, we explored the variation in the trophic positions of four symbiont species with the trophic position of the top predator as a proxy for food chain length of the symbiont community. Nest size did not affect food chain length, nor trophic distance between the symbionts. Instead, food chain length and the trophic positions of the symbionts were strongly affected by the host's foraging decisions.

Among these invaders, the introduction of the European perch (Perca fluviatilis) can have particularly detrimental effects on native communities, affecting both ecosystem functioning and human well-being. In this study, carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis was employed, using perch originating from five different ecosystems, to model the effects of their hypothetical introduction into İznik Lake, an economically and ecologically important, biodiversity-rich lake in northern Turkey, to ultimately assess their potential predation impact and competition with native predators. The results revealed that if perch were introduced to the community, they would - considering gape size limitations - primarily prey upon Vimba vimba and Rutilus rutilus, indicating a significant feeding pressure on these species. Furthermore, the study identified a potential overlap and competition for resources between commonly mesopredator perch and the European catfish Silurus glanis, the current top predator in the ecosystem. Both species would occupy top predatory positions, emphasizing the potential disruption of predator-prey dynamics. Our findings underscore the potential ecological repercussions of perch invasions. The selective predation on V. vimba and R. rutilus, with the latter being consumed to a lesser extent by perch, could lead to cascading effects throughout the food web, altering the community structure, and ecosystem dynamics. Additionally, the competition between perch and S. glanis raises concerns about effects on the stability and functioning of the fish community. These results highlight the need for proactive management strategies to mitigate the risk of perch introductions. Strict regulations on the movement and introduction of invasive species, along with comprehensive monitoring, are crucial for preserving native communities and maintaining the ecological integrity of freshwater ecosystems.

The isotopic features of the hairtail at the same body size differed among regions, with the fish in coastal waters presenting higher δ(15)N and δ(13)C values compared to those in the open sea, indicating different trophic levels (TL), food habits, and isotopic baselines. According to the partial correlation of water depth with δ(15)N values, the sampling stations were divided into three regions based on the depth of water: coastal (20-40 m), near coastal (60-80 m), and open sea (100-200 m) regions. In the coastal region, the hairtail from stations affected by the Pearl River plume exhibited lower δ(15)N and δ(13)C values. The stomach content analysis indicated different feeding habits of the hairtail from different regions. The hairtail in the coastal and near coastal waters fed more on fish and less on crustaceans compared to the hairtail in the open sea. The relationship between δ(15)N and fish size exhibited two contrary patterns. First, the δ(15)N values increased with increasing preanal length in the hairtail sampled from the water depth of 30-40 m in section F (in fish with preanal length < 200 mm) and those samples from the water depth of 100-200 m. This finding reflected an ontogenetic shift in diet and TL. However, the δ(15)N values tended to decrease with the increasing preanal length of the hairtail samples collected from the water depth of 30-40 m in section F (fish with a preanal length of ~200-300 mm). These findings suggested that under the conditions of insufficient availability of high-quality prey, the larger hairtail fed more on low-TL prey to compensate for the increase energy demand, arising due to growth, which led to the observed decrease in δ(15)N values.",S0048-9697(23)03936-0 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165313 [doi],Diet shift and Ribbonfish and Trophic level decreases and Water depth,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow of the Yangtze River is China's first ex situ reserve and the world's first successful case of ex situ conservation for cetaceans. In order to better protect the Yangtze finless porpoise, the effects of water-level fluctuations on the trophic structure in this oxbow cannot be ignored. Therefore, we employed stable isotope analysis to investigate the changes in the trophic position, trophic niche, and contribution of basal food sources to fish during the wet and dry seasons of 2021-2022. The research results indicate that based on stable isotope analysis of the trophic levels of different dietary fish species, fish trophic levels during the wet season were generally higher than those during the dry season, but the difference was not significant (p > 0.05). Fish communities in the Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow exhibited broader trophic niche space and lower trophic redundancy during the wet season (p < 0.05), indicating a more complex and stable food web structure. In both the wet and dry seasons, fish in the oxbow primarily relied on endogenous carbon sources, but there were significant differences in the way they were utilized between the two seasons (p < 0.05). In light of the changes in the trophic structure of the fish during the wet and dry seasons, and to ensure the stable development of the Yangtze finless porpoise population, we recommend strengthening the connectivity between the Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow and the Yangtze River.",biology12101359 [pii] and biology-12-01359 [pii] and 10.3390/biology12101359 [doi],Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow and Yangtze finless porpoise and dry season and trophic structure and water-level fluctuation and wet season,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The TP(mix) model characterized the structure of the wetland food web more accurately and significantly improved the reliability of TMF compared to the TP(bulk), TP(AAs), and TP(simmr) models, which were calculated based on the methods of stable nitrogen isotope analysis of bulk, traditional AAs-N-CSIA, and weighted β(Glu/Phe), respectively. Food source analysis revealed three interlocking food webs (kingfisher, crab, and frogs) in this wetland. The highest HOP biomagnification capacities (TMF(mix)) were found in the kingfisher food web (0.24-82.0), followed by the frog (0.08-34.0) and crab (0.56-11.7) food webs. The parabolic trends of TMF(mix) across combinations of log K(OW) in the frog food web were distinct from those of aquatic food webs (kingfisher and crab), which may be related to differences in food web composition and HOP bioaccumulation behaviors between aquatic and terrestrial organisms.

Extraction of lipids is traditionally carried out using methanol (MeOH) combined with chloroform or dichloromethane, these latter being well-known environmental pollutant and potential carcinogenic agents. Recently, extraction protocols based on methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and MeOH have been proposed as an alternative to halogenated solvents in lipidomic studies. However, no specific investigation has been performed to assess MTBE suitability in marine ecological studies including FA analysis together with SI measurements. We used an analytical workflow for qualitative and quantitative analysis of FAs and SIs in field samples of phytoplankton, zooplankton and the scyphomedusa Pelagia noctiluca, applying MTBE in comparison with chloroform- and dichloromethane-based protocols for total lipid extraction.

We compared the faunal community structure and food web structure associated with before and after fishing moratorium between ARs and non-ARs in Wanshan Island, Pearl River Estuary using stable isotope techniques. Community composition showed higher differences between ARs and non-ARs. The range of δ(13)C and δ(15)N of different functional groups can distinguish the pelagic and benthic trophic pathways of the food web in reef-or-not area before and after fishing moratorium. The isotopic niches of entire faunal, as well as individual functional groups, overlapped less between ARs and non-ARs in Wanshan Island, which makes the isotopic functional indices non-equivalent. The total convex hull area (TA) of ARs was larger than that of non-ARs, indicating that nutrient pathways of ARs were more diverse. Overall, however, these results suggest that trophic structure was convergence between ARs and non-ARs, and differences before and after fishing moratorium, possibly due to seasonal differences. Finally, it was shown that the construction of ARs had a weak effect on the restoration of fishery resources in this area, which might be related to lack of further management, or even similar community composition to non-ARs areas.",S0141-1136(23)00194-0 [pii] and 10.1016/j.marenvres.2023.106066 [doi],Artificial reef and Fishing moratorium and Isotopic niches and Stable isotope and Trophic structure,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The variations in the stable isotope contents (δ(15)N and δ(13)C) were determined for three small pelagic fishes (i.e., Engraulis encrasicolus, Sardina pilchardus, and Sprattus sprattus, respectively known as anchovies, sardines and sprats) collected across the western side of the basin. Our data allowed to determine the width and features of their trophic niches, to assess potential overlap or resource partitioning among them, and likely anticipate species adaptation to future climate change scenarios. Moreover, variations in stable isotope contents were correlated to both resource availability (i.e., mesozooplankton) and environmental variables. The high productivity and in turn the high resource availability of the basin, especially in the northern part, resulted in favor of the resource partitioning that occurs in each sub-area of the Adriatic Sea among the three species. Medium-sized specimens of the three species mostly fed on small zooplankton, while adult sprats relied on large copepods and those of sardines and anchovies also consumed large portion of phytoplankton, confirming the high trophic plasticity of these two dominants small pelagic species. However, considering that anchovies have the greatest degree of trophic diversity compared with the other two species, they could be the most adapted to changing feeding conditions. The increase in sea temperatures that are reducing primary production and in turn zooplankton abundances, coupled with even more frequent extreme meteorologic events could exacerbate the competition for trophic resources among pelagic mesopredators, and could lead to more notable stocks' fluctuations and unpredictable wasp-waist effects.",10.1038/s41598-023-40665-w [pii] and 40665 [pii] and 10.1038/s41598-023-40665-w [doi],NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results identified stable isotope variation with depleted δ(13)C and δ(15)N values in taxa near Boat Harbour. Blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus) were the most suitable bioindicators for identifying variation in nutrient sources.

"Gutiérrez-Fonseca, Pablo E and Pringle, Catherine M and Ramírez, Alonso and Gómez, Jesús E and García, Pavel",2024,Hurricane disturbance drives trophic changes in neotropical mountain stream food webs.,Ecology,"Food webs are complex ecological networks that reveal species interactions and energy flow in ecosystems. Prevailing ecological knowledge on forested streams suggests that their food webs are based on allochthonous carbon, driven by a constant supply of organic matter from adjacent vegetation and limited primary production due to low light conditions. Extreme climatic disturbances can disrupt these natural ecosystem dynamics by altering resource availability, which leads to changes in food web structure and functioning. Here, we quantify the response of stream food webs to two major hurricanes (Irma and María, Category 5 and 4, respectively) that struck Puerto Rico in September 2017. Within two tropical forested streams (first and second order), we collected ecosystem and food web data 6 months prior to the hurricanes and 2, 9, and 18 months afterward. We assessed the structural (e.g., canopy) and hydrological (e.g., discharge) characteristics of the ecosystem and monitored changes in basal resources (i.e., algae, biofilm, and leaf litter), consumers (e.g., aquatic invertebrates, riparian consumers), and applied Layman's community-wide metrics using the isotopic composition of (13) C and (15) N. Continuous stream discharge measurements indicated that the hurricanes did not cause an extreme hydrological event. However, the sixfold increase in canopy openness and associated changes in litter input appeared to trigger an increase in primary production. These food webs were primarily based on terrestrially derived carbon before the hurricanes, but most taxa (including Atya and Xiphocaris shrimp, the consumers with highest biomass) shifted their food source to autochthonous carbon within 2 months of the hurricanes. We also found evidence that the hurricanes dramatically altered the structure of the food web, resulting in shorter (i.e., smaller food-chain length), narrower (i.e., lower diversity of carbon sources) food webs, as well as increased trophic species packing. This study demonstrates how hurricane disturbance can alter stream food webs, changing the trophic base from allochthonous to autochthonous resources via changes in the physical environment (i.e., canopy defoliation). As hurricanes become more frequent and severe due to climate change, our findings greatly contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that maintain forested stream trophic interactions amidst global change.",10.1002/ecy.4202 [doi],Bayesian mixing model and disturbances and food webs and hurricanes and neotropical streams and stable isotopes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main aim of this study was to determine the impacts of seasonal riverine inputs on land-ocean Hg transport, zooplankton diet and Hg bioaccumulation in an Arctic estuary (Adventfjorden, Svalbard). The Adventelva River was a source of dissolved and particulate Hg to Adventfjorden, especially in June and July during the river's main discharge period. Stable isotope and fatty acid analyses suggest that zooplankton diet varied seasonally with diatoms dominating during the spring phytoplankton bloom in May and with increasing contributions of dinoflagellates in the summer months. In addition, there was evidence of increased terrestrial carbon utilization by zooplankton in June and July, when terrestrial particles contributed substantially to the particulate organic matter pool. Total (TotHg) and methyl Hg (MeHg) concentrations in zooplankton increased from April to August related to increased exposure to riverine inputs, and to shifts in zooplankton diet and community structure.

Such human-modified ecosystems have been associated with emerging infectious diseases, threatening human and animal health. However, human disturbance also creates new resources that some species can exploit. Common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) in Latin America constitute an important example, as their adaptation to human-modified habitats and livestock blood-feeding has implications for e.g., rabies transmission. Despite the well-known links between habitat degradation and disease emergence, few studies have explored how human-induced disturbance influences wildlife behavioural ecology and health, which can alter disease dynamics. To evaluate links among habitat disturbance, diet shifts, gut microbiota, and immunity, we quantified disturbance around roosting caves of common vampire bats in Costa Rica, measured their long-term diet preferences (livestock or wildlife blood) using stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, evaluated innate and adaptive immune markers, and characterized their gut microbiota. We observed that bats from roosting caves with more cattle farming nearby fed more on cattle blood. Moreover, gut microbial richness and the abundance of specific gut microbes differed according to feeding preferences. Interestingly, bats feeding primarily on wildlife blood harboured a higher abundance of the bacteria Edwardsiella sp., which tended to be associated with higher immunoglobulin G levels.

Biological sciences,"Large carnivores (order Carnivora) are among the world's most threatened mammals due to a confluence of ecological and social forces that have unfolded over centuries. Combining specimens from natural history collections with documents from archival records, we reconstructed the factors surrounding the extinction of the California grizzly bear (Ursus arctos californicus), a once-abundant brown bear subspecies last seen in 1924. Historical documents portrayed California grizzlies as massive hypercarnivores that endangered public safety. Yet, morphological measurements on skulls and teeth generate smaller body size estimates in alignment with extant North American grizzly populations (approx. 200 kg). Stable isotope analysis (δ(13)C, δ(15)N) of pelts and bones (n = 57) revealed that grizzlies derived less than 10% of their nutrition from terrestrial animal sources and were therefore largely herbivorous for millennia prior to the first European arrival in this region in 1542. Later colonial land uses, beginning in 1769 with the Mission era, led grizzlies to moderately increase animal protein consumption (up to 26% of diet), but grizzlies still consumed far less livestock than otherwise claimed by contemporary accounts.

However, how do the anaerobic functional microbes adapt to oxygen exposure and flexibly catabolize BTEX remain poorly understood. We investigated the switches of substrate spectrum and bacterial community upon oxygen perturbation in a nitrate-amended anaerobic toluene-degrading microbiota which was dominated by Aromatoleum species. DNA-stable isotope probing demonstrated that Aromatoleum species was involved in anaerobic mineralization of toluene. Metagenome-assembled genome of Aromatoleum species harbored both the nirBD-type genes for nitrate reduction to ammonium coupled with toluene oxidation and the additional meta-cleavage pathway for aerobic benzene catabolism.

We applied compound-specific stable isotope analyses of both carbon and nitrogen in amino acids from fish muscle tissue to quantify the proportional contributions of primary production sources and trophic positions of eight prey species (n = 474 total) that are part of Steller sea lion diets. Previous THg analyses of fish muscle, coupled with monomethylmercury analyses of a subset of samples, substantiated previous findings that fishes from the west of Amchitka Pass, a discrete oceanographic boundary of the Aleutian Archipelago, have higher muscle Hg concentrations relative to fishes from the east. The δ(13)C values of essential amino acids (EAAs) in fish muscle demonstrated that although most fishes obtained their EAAs primarily from algae, some species varied in the extent to which they relied on this EAA source. The δ(15)N values of phenylalanine (0.9 to 7.8 ‰), an indicator of the isotopic baseline of a food web, varied widely within and among fish species. Trophic position estimates, accounting for this baseline variation, were higher from the west relative to the east of the pass for some fish species. Trophic magnification slopes using baseline-corrected trophic position estimates indicated similar rates of Hg biomagnification to the east and west of Amchitka Pass. Multiple linear regression models revealed that trophic position was the most important driver of fish muscle [THg] with less variation explained by other parameters. Thus, higher trophic positions but not the rate of Hg biomagnification to the west of Amchitka Pass may play a role in the regional differences in both fish and Steller sea lion [THg].

This study investigated the behaviour of several pharmaceuticals in the rocky-bottom, macrobenthic food web in the coastal zone of Isfjorden (western Spitsbergen) using stable isotope analyses (SIA) coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Across 16 macroalgal and invertebrate species the highest average concentration was measured for ciprofloxacin (CIP) (on average 60.3 ng g(-1) dw) followed by paracetamol (PCT) (51.3 ng g(-1) dw) and nicotine (NIC) (37.8 ng g(-1) dw). The biomagnification potential was assessed for six target compounds of 13 analytes detected that were quantified with a frequency > 50 % in biological samples. The trophic magnification factor (TMF) ranged between 0.3 and 2.8, and was significant for NIC and CIP. TMF < 1.0 for NIC (0.3; confidence interval, CI 0.1-0.5) indicated that the compound does not accumulate with trophic position. The dilution of pharmaceutical residues in the food web may result from limited intake with dietary route, poor assimilation efficiency and high biotransformation rates in benthic invertebrates. TMF for CIP (2.8, CI 1.2-6.4) suggests trophic magnification, a phenomenon observed previously for several antibiotics in freshwater food webs. Trophic transfer therefore plays a role in controlling concentration of CIP in the Arctic benthic communities and should be considered in environmental risk assessment.

Marine resource subsidies may have profound effects on predator ecology, influencing population and niche dynamics. Expanding niches of top consumers can impact ecosystem resilience and interspecific interactions, affecting predator-prey dynamics and competition. We investigate the occurrence, importance, and impact of marine resources on trophic ecology and niche dynamics in a highly generalist predator, the caracal (Caracal caracal), on the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. Caracals have flexible diets, feeding across a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic prey. We use carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of fur samples (n = 75) to understand trophic position and niche shifts in coastal and inland foragers, as well as the implications of a diet rich in marine resources. We found significant differences in isotope signatures between these groups, with higher δ(13)C (P < 0.05) and δ(15)N values (P < 0.01) in coastal foragers. Isotope mixing models reveal that these elevated signatures were due to non-terrestrial food subsidies, where approximately a third of coastal foraging caracal diet comprised marine prey. The addition of marine prey species to diet increased both the trophic level and isotope niche size of coastal foraging caracals, with potential impacts on prey populations and competition. Our results suggest that marine prey are an important dietary resource for coastal foraging caracals, where seabirds, including two endangered species, are a major component of their diet. However, there are likely risks associated with these resource benefits, as routine consumption of seabirds is linked with higher pollutant burdens, particularly metals. Increased encounters between this terrestrial predator and seabirds may be a result of increased mainland colonies due to changes in habitat availability and the highly opportunistic and generalist foraging behaviour of a native predator.",S0048-9697(24)00046-9 [pii] and 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.169912 [doi],Caracal caracal and Foraging ecology and Marine resources and Niche ecology and Stable isotope analysis and Subsidies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

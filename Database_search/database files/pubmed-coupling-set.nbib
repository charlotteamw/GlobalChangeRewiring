AB  - The measurement of naturally occurring stable isotope ratios of the light 
      elements (C, N, H, O, S) in animal tissues and associated organic and inorganic 
      fractions of associated environments holds immense potential as a means of 
      addressing effects of global change on animals. This paper provides a brief 
      review of studies that have used the isotope approach to evaluate changes in 
      diet, isotopic niche, contaminant burden, reproductive and nutritional 
      investment, invasive species and shifts in migration origin or destination with 
      clear links to evaluating effects of global change. This field has now reached a 
      level of maturity that is impressive but generally underappreciated and involves 
      technical as well as statistical advances and access to freely available R-based 
      packages. There is a need for animal ecologists and conservationists to design 
      tissue collection networks that will best answer current and anticipated 
      questions related to the global change and the biodiversity crisis. These 
      developments will move the field of stable isotope ecology toward a more 
      hypothesis driven discipline related to rapidly changing global events.

TI  - Biological invasions alter the structure of a tropical freshwater food web.
PG  - e4173

AB  - Biological invasions are expected to alter food web structure, but there are 
      limited empirical data directly comparing invaded versus uninvaded food webs, 
      particularly in species-rich, tropical systems. We characterize for the first 
      time the food web of Lake Gatun-a diverse and highly invaded tropical freshwater 
      lake within the Panama Canal. We used stable isotope analysis to reconstruct the 
      trophic structure of the fish community of Lake Gatun and to compare it to that 
      of a minimally invaded reference lake, Lake Bayano. We found significant 
      differences between the trophic structures of these two Neotropical lakes, 
      notably that Lake Gatun's fish community was characterized by a longer food 
      chain, greater isotopic diversity, a broader range of trophic positions and body 
      sizes, and shifts in the isotopic positions of several native taxa relative to 
      Lake Bayano. The degree of isotopic overlap between native and non-native trophic 
      guilds in Lake Gatun was variable, with herbivores exhibiting the lowest 
      (20%-29%) overlap and carnivores the greatest (81%-100%). Overall, our results 
      provide some of the first empirical evidence for the ways in which multiple 
      introduced and native species may partition isotopic space in a species-rich 
      tropical freshwater food web.

TI  - Food Web Structures and Mercury Exposure Pathway to Fish in Minamata Bay.
PG  - 360-373
LID - 10.1007/s00244-023-01040-y [doi]
AB  - We analyzed total mercury content (THg) and carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) 
      stable isotope ratios in fish, subtidal macrobenthos, and particulate organic 
      matter (POM) as a proxy for pelagic phytoplankton and attached microalgae as a 
      proxy for microphytobenthos to investigate the mercury exposure pathway in fish. 
      For four seasons, samples of the above-mentioned organisms were collected on five 
      occasions (July and October 2018 and January, April, and July 2019) in Minamata 
      Bay. Isotope analysis showed that Minamata Bay food web structures were almost 
      entirely fueled by microphytobenthos. The THg values of the fish and macrobenthos 
      species were positively correlated with their δ(13)C. This indicates that their 
      diets, which were highly fueled by microphytobenthos, led to high THg 
      bioaccumulation in both macrobenthos and fish. The feeding habits of fishes 
      differ depending on the species, and they prey on organisms of many taxa, 
      including fish (mainly Japanese anchovy), crabs, shrimp, copepods, annelids, and 
      algae. Fish species that preyed on benthic crustaceans had high THg. These 
      results suggest that the main pathway of Hg bioaccumulation in fish from Minamata 
      Bay is the benthic food chain, which is primarily linked to benthic crustaceans 
      fueled by microphytobenthos.

TI  - Trophic downgrading of an adaptable carnivore in an urbanising landscape.
PG  - 21582

LID - 21582
AB  - Urbanisation critically alters wildlife habitat and resource distribution, 
      leading to shifts in trophic dynamics. The loss of apex predators in 
      human-transformed landscapes can result in changes in the ecological roles of the 
      remaining mesocarnivores. Decreased top-down control together with increased 
      bottom-up forcing through greater availability of anthropogenic foods can result 
      in a predation paradox. Understanding these changes is important for conserving 
      ecological function and biodiversity in rapidly urbanising systems. Here, we use 
      stable isotope analysis to provide insight into longer term changes in trophic 
      position, niche width and overlap of an elusive, medium-sized urban adapter, the 
      caracal (Caracal caracal) in and around the city of Cape Town, South Africa. 
      Using fur samples (n = 168) from individuals along a gradient of urbanisation we 
      find that overall caracals have a broad isotopic dietary niche that reflects 
      their large variation in resource use. When accounting for underlying 
      environmental differences, the﻿ intensity of anthropogenic pressure, measured 
      using the Human Footprint Index (HFI), explained variation in both food subsidy 
      use (δ(13)C values) and trophic status (δ(15)N values). The significantly higher 
      δ(13)C values (P < 0.01) and lower δ(15)N values (P < 0.001) of caracals in more 
      urbanised areas suggest that predator subsidy consumption occurs via predictable, 
      anthropogenic resource subsidies to synanthropic prey. These prey species are 
      predominantly primary consumers, resulting in shifts in diet composition towards 
      lower trophic levels. Further, caracals using areas with higher HFI had narrower 
      isotope niches than those in less impacted areas, likely due to their hyperfocus 
      on a few lower trophic level prey species. This pattern of niche contraction in 
      urban areas is retained when accounting for caracal demographics, including sex 
      and age. The removal of apex predators in human-transformed landscapes together 
      with reliable resource availability, including abundant prey, may paradoxically 
      limit the ecological influence of the remaining predators, and bring about a 
      degree of predator trophic downgrading. The dampening of top-down control, and 
      thus ecosystem regulation, likely points to widespread disruption of trophic 
      dynamics in rapidly developing areas globally.

TI  - Feeding habits and multifunctional classification of soil-associated consumers 
      from protists to vertebrates.
PG  - 1057-1117
LID - 10.1111/brv.12832 [doi]
AB  - Soil organisms drive major ecosystem functions by mineralising carbon and 
      releasing nutrients during decomposition processes, which supports plant growth, 
      aboveground biodiversity and, ultimately, human nutrition. Soil ecologists often 
      operate with functional groups to infer the effects of individual taxa on 
      ecosystem functions and services. Simultaneous assessment of the functional roles 
      of multiple taxa is possible using food-web reconstructions, but our knowledge of 
      the feeding habits of many taxa is insufficient and often based on limited 
      evidence. Over the last two decades, molecular, biochemical and isotopic tools 
      have improved our understanding of the feeding habits of various soil organisms, 
      yet this knowledge is still to be synthesised into a common functional framework. 
      Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the feeding habits of consumers in 
      soil, including protists, micro-, meso- and macrofauna (invertebrates), and 
      soil-associated vertebrates. We have integrated existing functional group 
      classifications with findings gained with novel methods and compiled an 
      overarching classification across taxa focusing on key universal traits such as 
      food resource preferences, body masses, microhabitat specialisation, protection 
      and hunting mechanisms. Our summary highlights various strands of evidence that 
      many functional groups commonly used in soil ecology and food-web models are 
      feeding on multiple types of food resources. In many cases, omnivory is observed 
      down to the species level of taxonomic resolution, challenging realism of 
      traditional soil food-web models based on distinct resource-based energy 
      channels. Novel methods, such as stable isotope, fatty acid and DNA gut content 
      analyses, have revealed previously hidden facets of trophic relationships of soil 
      consumers, such as food assimilation, multichannel feeding across trophic levels, 
      hidden trophic niche differentiation and the importance of alternative food/prey, 
      as well as energy transfers across ecosystem compartments. Wider adoption of such 
      tools and the development of open interoperable platforms that assemble 
      morphological, ecological and trophic data as traits of soil taxa will enable the 
      refinement and expansion of the multifunctional classification of consumers in 
      soil. The compiled multifunctional classification of soil-associated consumers 
      will serve as a reference for ecologists working with biodiversity changes and 
      biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, making soil food-web research 
      more accessible and reproducible.

AB  - The relationship between body mass (M) and size class abundance (N) depicts 
      patterns of community structure and energy flow through food webs. While the 
      general assumption is that M and N scale linearly (on log-log axes), nonlinearity 
      is regularly observed in natural systems, and is theorized to be driven by 
      nonlinear scaling of trophic level (TL) with M resulting in the rapid transfer of 
      energy to consumers in certain size classes. We tested this hypothesis with data 
      from 31 stream food webs. We predicted that allochthonous subsidies higher in the 
      web results in nonlinear M-TL relationships and systematic abundance peaks in 
      macroinvertebrate and fish size classes (latter containing salmonids), that 
      exploit terrestrial plant material and terrestrial invertebrates, respectively. 
      Indeed, both M-N and M-TL significantly deviated from linear relationships and 
      the observed curvature in M-TL scaling was inversely related to that observed in 
      M-N relationships. Systemic peaks in M-N, and troughs in M-TL occurred in size 
      classes dominated by generalist invertebrates, and brown trout. Our study reveals 
      how allochthonous resources entering high in the web systematically shape 
      community size structure and demonstrates the relevance of a generalized 
      metabolic scaling model for understanding patterns of energy transfer in 
      energetically 'open' food webs.

AB  - Riparian deforestation, which leads to increase in light intensity and excessive 
      nutrient loading in waterways, are two pervasive environmental stressors in the 
      stream ecosystems. Both have been found to alter basal resource availability and 
      consequently stream food webs. However, their interactive effects on trophic 
      structure in stream food webs are unclear. Here, we manipulated light intensity 
      and nutrient availability in three headwater streams to evaluate their effects on 
      consumer diet composition and food web characteristics (i.e., trophic diversity 
      and redundancy) with stable isotope analysis. Dietary analysis revealed that the 
      relative contribution of stream periphyton to the diets of macroinvertebrates 
      increased, while that of allochthonous resources, specifically leaf litter from 
      the terrestrial ecosystems in the catchment, decreased in response to open canopy 
      and nutrient enrichment in the streams. The trophic diversity also increased with 
      the elevated light intensity and nutrient availability, while the trophic 
      redundancy decreased, suggesting a reduced ability of the stream ecosystems to 
      resist environmental changes. Nutrient enrichment also increased the δ(15)N 
      ratios of periphyton and macroinvertebrates, indicating potential δ(15)N 
      enrichment of stream benthos by nitrogen pollution. Our results suggested that an 
      increase in light intensity due to riparian canopy openness and stream water 
      nutrient enrichment primarily from human activities have interactive effects on 
      resource flow and trophic structure in stream food webs.

TI  - Unraveling uncultivable pesticide degraders via stable isotope probing (SIP).
PG  - 1025-1048
LID - 10.1080/07388551.2018.1427697 [doi]
AB  - Uncultivable microorganisms account for over 99% of all species on earth, playing 
      essential roles in ecological processes such as carbon/nitrogen cycle and 
      chemical mineralization. Their functions remain unclear in ecosystems and natural 
      habitats, requiring cutting-edge biotechnologies for a deeper understanding. 
      Stable isotope probing (SIP) incorporates isotope-labeled elements, e.g. (13 )C, 
      (18 )O or (15 )N, into the cellular components of active microorganisms, serving 
      as a powerful tool to link phylogenetic identities to their ecological functions 
      in situ. Pesticides raise increasing attention for their persistence in the 
      environment, leading to severe damage and risks to the ecosystem and human 
      health. Cultivation and metagenomics help to identify either cultivable pesticide 
      degraders or potential pesticide metabolisms within microbial communities, from 
      various environmental media including the soil, groundwater, activated sludge, 
      plant rhizosphere, etc. However, the application of SIP in characterizing 
      pesticide degraders is limited, leaving considerable space in understanding the 
      natural pesticide mineralization process. In this review, we try to 
      comprehensively summarize the fundamental principles, successful cases and 
      technical protocols of SIP in unraveling functional-yet-uncultivable pesticide 
      degraders, by raising its shining lights and shadows. Particularly, this study 
      provides deeper insights into various feasible isotope-labeled substrates in SIP 
      studies, including pesticides, pesticide metabolites, and similar compounds. 
      Coupled with other techniques, such as next-generation sequencing, nanoscale 
      secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS), single cell genomics, 
      magnetic-nanoparticle-mediated isolation (MMI) and compound-specific isotope 
      analysis (CSIA), SIP will significantly broaden our understanding of pesticide 
      biodegradation process in situ.

      Analysis.

AB  - The ancestral panda Ailurarctos lufengensis, excavated from the late Miocene, is 
      thought to be carnivorous or omnivorous [1]. Today, giant pandas exclusively 
      consume bamboo and have distinctive tooth, skull, and muscle characteristics 
      adapted to a tough and fibrous bamboo diet during their long evolution [1, 2]. A 
      special feature, the pseudo-thumb, has evolved to permit the precise and 
      efficient grasping of bamboo [3, 4]. Unlike those of extant pandas, little is 
      known about the diet and habitat preferences of extinct pandas. Prevailing 
      studies suggest that the panda shifted to specialized bamboo feeding in the 
      Pleistocene [5, 6]; however, this remains questionable. Pandas now survive in a 
      fraction of their historical habitat [7], but no specific information has been 
      reported. Stable isotope analyses can be used to understand diet- and 
      habitat-related changes in animals [8]. Isotopic signals in bone collagen reflect 
      dietary compositions of ancient human diets [9, 10] and dietary changes between 
      historical and modern animal populations [11, 12]. Here, we conduct stable 
      isotope analyses of bone and tooth samples from ancient and modern pandas and 
      from sympatric fauna. We show that pandas have had a diet dominated by C(3) 
      resources over time and space and that trophic niches of ancient and modern 
      pandas are distinctly different. The isotopic trophic and ecological niche widths 
      of ancient pandas are approximately three times larger than those of modern 
      pandas, suggesting that ancient pandas possibly had more complex diets and 
      habitats than do their modern counterparts. Our findings provide insight into the 
      dietary evolution and habitat contraction of pandas.

AB  - Changing ecological conditions along environmental gradients influence patterns 
      of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. However, how networks of interacting 
      species respond to these changes remains unclear. We quantified aquatic food webs 
      along longitudinal stream gradients spanning the Rocky Mountain-Great Plains 
      ecotone using community composition, functional traits, and stable isotopes. We 
      predicted that increasing ecosystem size, productivity, and species richness 
      along the gradient would positively influence aquatic trophic diversity (e.g., 
      expanded vertical and horizontal trophic niche breadths). We also predicted that 
      trophic redundancy among fish species would decrease moving downstream as species 
      partition food resources (e.g., reduced trophic niche overlap). Consumer stable 
      isotope data (δ(13) C and δ(15) N) revealed nonlinear changes in trophic 
      diversity along the gradient. Invertebrate trophic diversity had a dome-shaped 
      relationship with the gradient, strongly linked to an expanding then contracting 
      δ(13) C range. Fish trophic diversity initially increased and then plateaued 
      downstream, despite linearly expanding δ(13) C and δ(15) N ranges. Trophic 
      redundancy within the fish community decreased downstream along the gradient. 
      However, trophic redundancy also showed a nonlinear relationship with fish 
      species richness; it initially declined, then began to increase when more than 
      nine species were present, indicating a shift from niche partitioning to niche 
      packing at intermediate species richness levels. This result suggests that while 
      δ(13) C and δ(15) N ranges for fish communities increased across the gradient, 
      niche packing within communities in the Great Plains caused overall trophic 
      diversity to saturate. Our results demonstrate that food web structure along 
      stream gradients reflects an interaction between factors that decrease trophic 
      redundancy, such as increased living space and niche partitioning, versus factors 
      that increase trophic redundancy, such as increased species richness and niche 
      packing. Our study helps to explain how multiple mechanisms shape food web 
      properties along longitudinal stream gradients, and where niche partitioning or 
      niche packing may be dominant. Understanding the functional roles of organisms 
      across similar environmental gradients in other ecosystems will be increasingly 
      important because they determine how food webs, and thus ecosystem function, will 
      respond to environmental change, biodiversity loss, or species invasions.

AB  - The use of marine subsidies by terrestrial predators can facilitate substantial 
      transfer of nutrients between marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Marine resource 
      subsidies may have profound effects on predator ecology, influencing population 
      and niche dynamics. Expanding niches of top consumers can impact ecosystem 
      resilience and interspecific interactions, affecting predator-prey dynamics and 
      competition. We investigate the occurrence, importance, and impact of marine 
      resources on trophic ecology and niche dynamics in a highly generalist predator, 
      the caracal (Caracal caracal), on the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. Caracals have 
      flexible diets, feeding across a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic prey. We 
      use carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of fur samples (n = 75) to 
      understand trophic position and niche shifts in coastal and inland foragers, as 
      well as the implications of a diet rich in marine resources. We found significant 
      differences in isotope signatures between these groups, with higher δ(13)C 
      (P < 0.05) and δ(15)N values (P < 0.01) in coastal foragers. Isotope mixing 
      models reveal that these elevated signatures were due to non-terrestrial food 
      subsidies, where approximately a third of coastal foraging caracal diet comprised 
      marine prey. The addition of marine prey species to diet increased both the 
      trophic level and isotope niche size of coastal foraging caracals, with potential 
      impacts on prey populations and competition. Our results suggest that marine prey 
      are an important dietary resource for coastal foraging caracals, where seabirds, 
      including two endangered species, are a major component of their diet. However, 
      there are likely risks associated with these resource benefits, as routine 
      consumption of seabirds is linked with higher pollutant burdens, particularly 
      metals. Increased encounters between this terrestrial predator and seabirds may 
      be a result of increased mainland colonies due to changes in habitat availability 
      and the highly opportunistic and generalist foraging behaviour of a native 
      predator.

AB  - Stable isotope technique is important for understanding the structure and 
      function of soil food web, which is considered as a belowground black box. We 
      reviewed typical application cases of stable isotope techniques in the research 
      of soil food webs, including to determine food sources and feeding preferences of 
      soil fauna by using isotopes, and to analyze the trophic structure of soil food 
      webs through isotope fractionation effects during the process of feeding and 
      nutrient sequestration by soil fauna. Additionally, stable isotope techniques 
      could reveal the role of soil biota at different trophic levels within soil food 
      web in ecosystem matter and energy flow, which favored to carry out accurate and 
      efficient research on the contribution of soil food webs to soil carbon and 
      nitrogen cycling process and the corresponding influence mechanism. We further 
      put forward the limitations of current stable isotope techniques and the future 
      development directions.

AB  - Accurately quantifying trophic positions (TP) to describe food web structure is 
      an important element in studying pollutant bioaccumulation. In recent years, 
      compound-specific nitrogen isotopic analysis of amino acids (AAs-N-CSIA) has been 
      progressively applied as a potentially reliable tool for quantifying TP, 
      facilitating a better understanding of pollutant food web transfer. Therefore, 
      this review provides an overview of the analytical procedures, applications, and 
      limitations of AAs-N-CSIA in pollutant (halogenated organic pollutants (HOPs) and 
      heavy metals) bioaccumulation studies. We first summarize studies on the 
      analytical techniques of AAs-N-CSIA, including derivatization, instrumental 
      analysis, and data processing methods. The N-pivaloyl-i-propyl-amino acid ester 
      method is a more suitable AAs derivatization method for quantifying TP. The 
      AAs-N-CSIA application in pollutant bioaccumulation studies (e.g., Hg, MeHg, and 
      HOPs) is discussed, and its application in conjunction with various techniques 
      (e.g., spatial analysis, food source analysis, and compound tracking techniques, 
      etc.) to research the influence of pollutant levels on organisms is summarized. 
      Finally, the limitations of AAs-N-CSIA in pollutant bioaccumulation studies are 
      discussed, including the use of single empirical values of β(glu/phe) and 
      TDF(glu/phe) that result in large errors in TP quantification. The weighted 
      β(glu/phe) and the multi-TDF(glu/phe) models are still challenging to solve for 
      accurate TP quantification of omnivores; however, factors affecting the variation 
      of β(glu/phe) and TDF(glu/phe) are unclear, especially the effect of pollutant 
      bioaccumulation in organisms on internal AA metabolic processes.

AB  - Global change is fundamentally altering flows of natural and anthropogenic 
      subsidies across space and time. After a pointed call for research on subsidies 
      in the 1990s, an industry of empirical work has documented the ubiquitous role 
      subsidies play in ecosystem structure, stability, and function. Here, we argue 
      that physical constraints (e.g., water temperature) and species traits can govern 
      a species' accessibility to resource subsidies, which has been largely overlooked 
      in the subsidy literature. We examined the input of a high-quality, point-source 
      anthropogenic subsidy (aquaculture feed) into a recipient freshwater lake food 
      web. Using a combined bio-tracer approach, we detect a gradient in accessibility 
      of the anthropogenic subsidy within the surrounding food web driven by the 
      thermal preferences of three constituent species, effectively rewiring the 
      recipient lake food web. Because aquaculture is predicted to increase 
      significantly in coming decades to support growing human populations, and global 
      change is altering temperature regimes, then this form of food web alteration may 
      be expected to occur frequently. We argue that subsidy accessibility is a key 
      characteristic of recipient food web interactions that must be considered when 
      trying to understand the impacts of subsidies on ecosystem stability and function 
      under continued global change.

AB  - In recent years, sea ice cover along coasts of East Antarctica has tended to 
      increase. To understand ecological implications of these environmental changes, 
      we studied benthic food web structure on the coasts of Adélie Land during an 
      event of unusually high sea ice cover (i.e. two successive austral summers 
      without seasonal breakup). We used integrative trophic markers (stable isotope 
      ratios of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur) to build ecological models and explored 
      feeding habits of macroinvertebrates. In total, 28 taxa spanning most present 
      animal groups and functional guilds were investigated. Our results indicate that 
      the absence of seasonal sea ice breakup deeply influenced benthic food webs. 
      Sympagic algae dominated the diet of many key consumers, and the trophic levels 
      of invertebrates were low, suggesting omnivore consumers did not rely much on 
      predation and/or scavenging. Our results provide insights about how Antarctic 
      benthic consumers, which typically live in an extremely stable environment, might 
      adapt their feeding habits in response to sudden changes in environmental 
      conditions and trophic resource availability. They also show that local and/or 
      global trends of sea ice increase in Antarctica have the potential to cause 
      drastic changes in food web structure, and therefore to impact benthic 
      communities.

AB  - Overfishing is a worldwide occurrence that simplifies marine food webs, changes 
      trophic patterns, and alters community structure, affecting not only the density 
      of harvested species but also their trophic function. The northwestern Atlantic 
      has a history of heavy fishing, and over the past century has also experienced 
      destructive bottom fishing and harmful mobile fishing gear. After confirming that 
      preservation solvent did not alter the nitrogen stable isotopes of preserved 
      samples, we used museum specimens and modern samples to analyze nitrogen stable 
      isotopes in tissues of two common demersal fishes pre-1950 (1850 to 1950) 
      compared to 2021 to assess changes in trophic positions of coastal New England 
      consumers over this time period. Both the mesopredator Centropristis striata 
      (black sea bass) and the benthivore Stenotomus chrysops (scup) experienced 
      significant declines in trophic position during this time. C. striata declined 
      almost a full trophic level, S. chrysops declined half a trophic level, and these 
      species are now occupying almost the same trophic position. Heavy fishing 
      activities potentially shorten food chains, simplify trophic complexity, lessen 
      the separation of trophic niches, and generally flatten food webs. The 
      consequences of these within-species shifts are poorly investigated but could 
      generate underappreciated cascading impacts on community structure and function. 
      Archived natural-history collections are an invaluable resource for investigating 
      ecological changes in natural communities through time. The evaluation of 
      changing trophic positions via stable isotope analysis may allow fisheries 
      managers to quantify large-scale effects of fishing on ecosystems and food webs 
      over time.

AB  - Competition plays a central role in the maintenance of biodiversity. A backbone 
      of classic niche theory is that local coexistence of competitors is favoured by 
      the contraction or divergence of species' niches. However, this effect should 
      depend on the diversity of resources available in the local environment, 
      particularly when resources vary in multiple ecological dimensions. Here, we 
      investigated how available resource breadth (i.e. prey diversity) and competition 
      together shape multidimensional niche variation (between and within individuals) 
      and interspecific niche overlap in 42 populations of congeneric tropical frog 
      species. We modelled realized niches in two key trophic dimensions (prey size and 
      carbon stable isotopes) and sampled available food resources to quantify 
      two-dimensional resource breadth. We found a 14-fold variation in 
      multidimensional population niche width across populations, most of which was 
      accounted for by within-individual diet variation. This striking variation was 
      predicted by an interaction whereby individual niche breadth increased with 
      resource breadth and decreased with the number of congeneric competitors. These 
      ecological gradients also interact to influence the degree of niche overlap 
      between species, which surprisingly decreased with population total niche width, 
      providing novel insights on how similar species can coexist in local communities. 
      Together, our results emphasize that patterns of exploitation of resources in 
      multiple dimensions are driven by both competitive interactions and extrinsic 
      factors such as local resource breadth.

LID - e10800
AB  - The consequences of biological invasions and habitat degradation for native 
      biodiversity depend on how species cope with the individual and synergetic 
      challenges these processes present. To assess the impact of anthropogenic 
      land-use on the food web architecture of an invaded community, we examine the 
      diets of nine native and two highly invasive mammal species at different trophic 
      levels, inhabiting different land-uses across six biogeographic regions in 
      Tasmania, Australia. We use two complementary methods, environmental DNA 
      metabarcoding analysis (eDNA) of faeces and stable isotope analysis (SIA) of 
      nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) in whole blood, to account for the high 
      interindividual and temporal variability in the diets of multiple species 
      simultaneously. eDNA showed regionalisation in the diet of smaller species, with 
      land-use further defining dietary taxa within each region. SIA revealed that 
      bioregion and land-use influence the δ(13)C values of all carnivore species and 
      omnivores, whereas the δ(15)N values of these species are influenced only by 
      land-use and not bioregion. Including multiple species showed that native rats 
      are changing their diet in response to the presence of invasive rats, an impact 
      that would have otherwise been attributed to land-use. Our findings demonstrate 
      that human activities and invasive species are moulding the diets of invaded 
      communities, raising questions about the potential impacts that dietary 
      modifications will have on the life-history traits and the evolutionary 
      consequences these modifications might have on the survival of native species. 
      This highlights the urgency of including human activities in ecological studies 
      and the importance of targeting multispecies assemblages to gain a better 
      understanding of synergetic impacts on native biodiversity.

TI  - You are what your host eats: The trophic structure and food chain length of a

AB  - Food chain length provides key information on the flow of nutrients and energy in 
      ecosystems. Variation in food chain length has primarily been explained by 
      environmental drivers such as ecosystem size and productivity. Most insights are 
      obtained from theory or aquatic systems, but the importance of these drivers 
      remains largely untested in terrestrial systems. We exploited red wood ant nests 
      markedly differing in size as natural experiments to quantify the drivers of 
      trophic structure and food chain length of their symbiont arthropod communities. 
      Using stable isotopes, we explored the variation in the trophic positions of four 
      symbiont species with the trophic position of the top predator as a proxy for 
      food chain length of the symbiont community. Nest size did not affect food chain 
      length, nor trophic distance between the symbionts. Instead, food chain length 
      and the trophic positions of the symbionts were strongly affected by the host's 
      foraging decisions. When the host diet shifted from predominantly herbivorous to 
      more predacious, the trophic position of the symbionts and food chain length 
      strongly increased. We show for the first time that a food web can be structured 
      by biotic interactions with an engineering species rather than by abiotic 
      environmental variables.

TI  - Invasive predator diet plasticity has implications for native fish conservation 
      and invasive species suppression.
PG  - e0279099

AB  - Diet plasticity is a common behavior exhibited by piscivores to sustain predator 
      biomass when preferred prey biomass is reduced. Invasive piscivore diet 
      plasticity could complicate suppression success; thus, understanding invasive 
      predator consumption is insightful to meeting conservation targets. Here, we 
      determine if diet plasticity exists in an invasive apex piscivore and whether 
      plasticity could influence native species recovery benchmarks and invasive 
      species suppression goals. We compared diet and stable isotope signatures of 
      invasive lake trout and native Yellowstone cutthroat trout (cutthroat trout) from 
      Yellowstone Lake, Wyoming, U.S.A. as a function of no, low-, moderate-, and 
      high-lake trout density states. Lake trout exhibited plasticity in relation to 
      their density; consumption of cutthroat trout decreased 5-fold (diet proportion 
      from 0.89 to 0.18) from low- to high-density state. During the high-density 
      state, lake trout switched to amphipods, which were also consumed by cutthroat 
      trout, resulting in high diet overlap (Schoener's index value, D = 0.68) between 
      the species. As suppression reduced lake trout densities (moderate-density 
      state), more cutthroat trout were consumed (proportion of cutthroat trout = 
      0.42), and diet overlap was released between the species (D = 0.30). A shift in 
      lake trout δ13C signatures from the high- to the moderate-density state also 
      corroborated increased consumption of cutthroat trout and lake trout diet 
      plasticity. Observed declines in lake trout are not commensurate with expected 
      cutthroat trout recovery due to lake trout diet plasticity. The abundance of the 
      native species in need of conservation may take longer to recover due to the diet 
      plasticity of the invasive species. The changes observed in diet, diet overlap, 
      and isotopes associated with predator suppression provides more insight into 
      conservation and suppression dynamics than using predator and prey biomass alone. 
      By understanding these dynamics, we can better prepare conservation programs for 
      potential feedbacks caused by invasive species suppression.

      disease, Mycobacterium ulcerans.
PG  - e1600387
LID - e1600387
AB  - Generalist microorganisms are the agents of many emerging infectious diseases 
      (EIDs), but their natural life cycles are difficult to predict due to the 
      multiplicity of potential hosts and environmental reservoirs. Among 250 known 
      human EIDs, many have been traced to tropical rain forests and specifically 
      freshwater aquatic systems, which act as an interface between microbe-rich 
      sediments or substrates and terrestrial habitats. Along with the rapid 
      urbanization of developing countries, population encroachment, deforestation, and 
      land-use modifications are expected to increase the risk of EID outbreaks. We 
      show that the freshwater food-web collapse driven by land-use change has a 
      nonlinear effect on the abundance of preferential hosts of a generalist bacterial 
      pathogen, Mycobacterium ulcerans. This leads to an increase of the pathogen 
      within systems at certain levels of environmental disturbance. The complex link 
      between aquatic, terrestrial, and EID processes highlights the potential 
      importance of species community composition and structure and species life 
      history traits in disease risk estimation and mapping. Mechanisms such as the one 
      shown here are also central in predicting how human-induced environmental change, 
      for example, deforestation and changes in land use, may drive emergence.

AB  - Climate change and associated droughts threaten the ecology and resilience of 
      natural saline lakes globally. There is a distinct lack of research regarding 
      their ecological response to climatic events in the Global South. This region is 
      predicted to experience climatic events such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation 
      (ENSO) more often and with greater severity with the potential to alter the 
      structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems significantly. From 2015 to 2016 
      South Africa experienced one of the most severe country-wide droughts as a result 
      of a strong ENSO event. Our study aimed to investigate the effect of this 
      supra-seasonal drought on the trophic structure of fish communities in a 
      naturally saline shallow lake of a Ramsar wetland using stable isotope 
      techniques. Fishes and potential basal sources were collected from the lake, 
      during predrought conditions in 2010 and after severe drought (recovery phase; 
      2017). The δ(13)C and δ(15)N values of food web elements were determined and 
      analysed using Bayesian mixing models and Bayesian Laymen metrics to establish 
      the proportional contribution of C(3) and C(4) basal sources to the fish 
      (consumer) diets, and examine the fish community in terms of isotopic niche and 
      trophic structure, respectively. Fish consumers relied predominantly on C(3) 
      basal sources in the predrought and shifted to greater reliance on C(4) basal 
      sources, decreased isotopic niche space use and a reduction in trophic length in 
      the recovery phase. Drought altered the type and abundance of the basal sources 
      available by limiting sources to those that are more drought-tolerant, reducing 
      the trophic pathways of the food web with no significant alterations in the fish 
      community. These results demonstrate the resilience and biological plasticity of 
      Lake Nyamithi and its aquatic fauna, highlighting the importance of freshwater 
      inflow to saline lakes with alterations thereof posing a significant threat to 
      their continued functioning.

AB  - Stable isotope signatures (δ(13)C, δ(15)N) and trace elements (TEs) were analyzed 
      from invertebrates and fish to assess food web structure and the biomagnification 
      or biodilution of Cu, Pb, Cd, Zn, Mn, Cr, Hg and As in coastal waters of Ha Tinh 
      Province, Central Vietnam. δ(13)C and δ(15)N values of purported food sources 
      (sediments, phytoplankton, macroalgae, and zooplankton) ranged from 
      -21.24 ± 0.39‰ to -16.72 ± 1.02‰ and from 3.02 ± 0.70‰ to 7.30 ± 0.42‰, 
      respectively. The δ(13)C and δ(15)N values in invertebrates and fish ranged from 
      -19.75 ± 0.10‰ to -18.68 ± 0.40‰, and from 7.02 ± 1.21‰ to 9.10 ± 0.29‰. The 
      δ(15)N values showed that the food web structure could be divided into four 
      trophic levels. The benthic invertebrates had significantly higher concentrations 
      of Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd and As. Hg concentrations tended to accumulate higher in the 
      crabs and fish. The biodilution of Pb, Cd, Zn, Cr was observed throughout the 
      food web, whereas biomagnification was observed for Cr, Mn, and As in bivalves; 
      Cd and Zn in gastropods; Pb, Cd, Zn, and As in crabs; Cd in prawns and Hg in 
      fish.

TI  - Food web differences between two neighboring tropical high mountain lakes and the 
      influence of introducing a new top predator.

AB  - High mountain lakes (HMLs) are considered unique and comparable ecosystems for 
      monitoring global climate change. The food web structure can indicate the 
      response of these ecosystems to ecological threats, such as fish introduction, by 
      analyzing the trophic dynamics. Nonetheless, the food webs of tropical HMLs are 
      less well-studied than temperate HMLs. The present study assessed the food webs 
      of two neighboring (600 m apart) tropical HMLs, El Sol and La Luna, inside the 
      crater of the Nevado de Toluca volcano, Mexico. It used stable isotopes (δ13C and 
      δ15N) and Bayesian mixing models with different trophic discrimination factors 
      and priors to assess the impacts of introduced rainbow trout, persisting only in 
      the larger lake, El Sol. The food web in Lake El Sol was more complex than in 
      Lake La Luna, mainly due to its larger size, extensive vegetated littoral zone, 
      and being fueled by autochthonous primary production. In contrast, the smaller 
      and fishless Lake La Luna has a reduced and bare littoral zone that harbored a 
      simple food web substantially sustained by allochthonous carbon inputs. The 
      persistence of introduced rainbow trout in Lake El Sol but not in Lake La Luna 
      accentuated the differences between the lakes. The models suggested that rainbow 
      trout fed on key consumers of littoral macroinvertebrates (70-80%) and pelagic 
      zooplankton (20-30%), increasing the linkage between sub-networks. In both 
      tropical HMLs, the species richness and herbivorous fraction were elevated 
      compared with temperate HMLs, while the linkage density and omnivorous fraction 
      were lower. Basal nodes dominated these tropical HMLs, and the vegetated littoral 
      zone of Lake El Sol had more intermediate (omnivore) nodes. Our results showed 
      the convenience of food web analysis to compare the effects of introduced fish in 
      originally fishless lakes in different latitudes.

TI  - Species invasion progressively disrupts the trophic structure of native food 
      webs.
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2102179118 [doi]
LID - e2102179118
AB  - Species invasions can have substantial impacts on native species and ecosystems, 
      with important consequences for biodiversity. How these disturbances drive 
      changes in the trophic structure of native food webs through time is poorly 
      understood. Here, we quantify trophic disruption in freshwater food webs to 
      invasion by an apex fish predator, lake trout, using an extensive stable isotope 
      dataset across a natural gradient of uninvaded and invaded lakes in the northern 
      Rocky Mountains, USA. Lake trout invasion increased fish diet variability 
      (trophic dispersion), displaced native fishes from their reference diets (trophic 
      displacement), and reorganized macroinvertebrate communities, indicating strong 
      food web disruption. Trophic dispersion was greatest 25 to 50 y after 
      colonization and dissipated as food webs stabilized in later stages of invasion 
      (>50 y). For the native apex predator, bull trout, trophic dispersion preceded 
      trophic displacement, leading to their functional loss in late-invasion food 
      webs. Our results demonstrate how invasive species progressively disrupt native 
      food webs via trophic dispersion and displacement, ultimately yielding biological 
      communities strongly divergent from those in uninvaded ecosystems.

TI  - Water diversion and pollution interactively shape freshwater food webs through 
      bottom-up mechanisms.
PG  - 859-876
LID - 10.1111/gcb.16026 [doi]
AB  - Water diversion and pollution are two pervasive stressors in river ecosystems 
      that often co-occur. Individual effects of both stressors on basal resources 
      available to stream communities have been described, with diversion reducing 
      detritus standing stocks and pollution increasing biomass of primary producers. 
      However, interactive effects of both stressors on the structure and trophic basis 
      of food webs remain unknown. We hypothesized that the interaction between both 
      stressors increases the contribution of the green pathway in stream food webs. 
      Given the key role of the high-quality, but less abundant, primary producers, we 
      also hypothesized an increase in food web complexity with larger trophic 
      diversity in the presence of water diversion and pollution. To test these 
      hypotheses, we selected four rivers in a range of pollution subject to similar 
      water diversion schemes, and we compared food webs upstream and downstream of the 
      diversion. We characterized food webs by means of stable isotope analysis. Both 
      stressors directly changed the availability of basal resources, with water 
      diversion affecting the brown food web by decreasing detritus stocks, and 
      pollution enhancing the green food web by promoting biofilm production. The 
      propagation of the effects at the base of the food web to higher trophic levels 
      differed between stressors. Water diversion had little effect on the structure of 
      food webs, but pollution increased food chain length and trophic diversity, and 
      reduced trophic redundancy. The effects at higher trophic levels were exacerbated 
      when combining both stressors, as the relative contribution of biofilm to the 
      stock of basal resources increased even further. Overall, we conclude that 
      moderate pollution increases food web complexity and that the interaction with 
      water abstraction seems to amplify this effect. Our study shows the importance of 
      assessing the interaction between stressors to create predictive tools for a 
      proper management of ecosystems.

TI  - Stratification, nitrogen fixation, and cyanobacterial bloom stage regulate the 
      planktonic food web structure.
PG  - 794-810
LID - 10.1111/gcb.14546 [doi]
AB  - Changes in the complexity of planktonic food webs may be expected in future 
      aquatic systems due to increases in sea surface temperature and an enhanced 
      stratification of the water column. Under these conditions, the growth of 
      unpalatable, filamentous, N(2) -fixing cyanobacterial blooms, and their effect on 
      planktonic food webs will become increasingly important. The planktonic food web 
      structure in aquatic ecosystems at times of filamentous cyanobacterial blooms is 
      currently unresolved, with discordant lines of evidence suggesting that 
      herbivores dominate the mesozooplankton or that mesozooplankton organisms are 
      mainly carnivorous. Here, we use a set of proxies derived from amino acid 
      nitrogen stable isotopes from two mesozooplankton size fractions to identify 
      changes in the nitrogen source and the planktonic food web structure across 
      different microplankton communities. A transition from herbivory to carnivory in 
      mesozooplankton between more eutrophic, near-coastal sites and more oligotrophic, 
      offshore sites was accompanied by an increasing diversity of microplankton 
      communities with aging filamentous cyanobacterial blooms. Our analyses of 124 
      biotic and abiotic variables using multivariate statistics confirmed salinity as 
      a major driver for the biomass distribution of non-N(2) -fixing microplankton 
      species such as dinoflagellates. However, we provide strong evidence that 
      stratification, N(2) fixation, and the stage of the cyanobacterial blooms 
      regulated much of the microplankton diversity and the mean trophic position and 
      size of the metabolic nitrogen pool in mesozooplankton. Our empirical, macroscale 
      data set consistently unifies contrasting results of the dominant feeding mode in 
      mesozooplankton during blooms of unpalatable, filamentous, N(2) -fixing 
      cyanobacteria by identifying the at times important role of heterotrophic 
      microbial food webs. Thus, carnivory, rather than herbivory, dominates in 
      mesozooplankton during aging and decaying cyanobacterial blooms with hitherto 
      uncharacterized consequences for the biogeochemical functions of mesozooplankton.

AB  - Food-web complexity often hinders disentangling functionally relevant aspects of 
      food-web structure and its relationships to biodiversity. Here, we present a 
      theoretical framework to evaluate food-web complexity in terms of biodiversity. 
      Food network unfolding is a theoretical method to transform a complex food web 
      into a linear food chain based on ecosystem processes. Based on this method, we 
      can define three biodiversity indices, horizontal diversity (D(H) ), vertical 
      diversity (D(V) ) and range diversity (D(R) ), which are associated with the 
      species diversity within each trophic level, diversity of trophic levels, and 
      diversity in resource use, respectively. These indices are related to Shannon's 
      diversity index (H'), where H' = D(H)  + D(V)  - D(R) . Application of the 
      framework to three riverine macroinvertebrate communities revealed that D 
      indices, calculated from biomass and stable isotope features, captured well the 
      anthropogenic, seasonal, or other within-site changes in food-web structures that 
      could not be captured with H' alone.

TI  - Land use alters trophic redundancy and resource flow through stream food webs.
PG  - 677-689
LID - 10.1111/1365-2656.12955 [doi]
AB  - The changes to physical and chemical ecosystem characteristics as a response to 
      pervasive and intensifying land use have the potential to alter the 
      consumer-resource interactions and to rewire the flow of energy through entire 
      food webs. We investigated these structural and functional properties of food 
      webs in stream ecosystems distributed across woodland, agricultural and urban 
      areas in the Zagreb region of Croatia. We compared resource availability and 
      consumer diet composition using stable isotope mixing models and tested how the 
      isotopic variance of basal resources, primary consumers, macroinvertebrate 
      predators and other food web characteristics change with different land-use 
      types. Combination of increased loading and altered composition of nutrients, 
      lower water discharge and higher light availability at urban sites likely 
      promoted the contribution of aquatic macrophytes to diets of primary consumers. 
      Macroinvertebrate predators shifted their diet, relying more on active filterers 
      at urban sites relative to woodland and agricultural sites. Urban food webs also 
      had lower trophic redundancy (i.e. fewer species at each trophic level) and a 
      more homogenized energy flow from lower to higher trophic levels. There was no 
      effect of land use on isotopic variation of basal resources, primary consumers or 
      macroinvertebrate predators, but all these trophic groups at urban and 
      agricultural sites were (15) N-enriched relative to their counterparts in 
      woodland stream food webs. The physical and chemical ecosystem characteristics 
      associated with intensive land use altered the resource availability, trophic 
      redundancy and the flow of energy to other trophic levels, with potentially 
      negative consequences for community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. These 
      empirical findings indicate that reducing nutrient pollution, agricultural 
      runoffs and maintaining riparian vegetation can mitigate the impacts of land use 
      on structure and function of stream ecosystems.

TI  - Internal Dynamics and Metabolism of Mercury in Biota: A Review of Insights from 
      Mercury Stable Isotopes.
PG  - 9182-9195
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.1c08631 [doi]
AB  - Monitoring mercury (Hg) levels in biota is considered an important objective for 
      the effectiveness evaluation of the Minamata Convention. While many studies have 
      characterized Hg levels in organisms at multiple spatiotemporal scales, 
      concentration analyses alone often cannot provide sufficient information on the 
      Hg exposure sources and internal processes occurring within biota. Here, we 
      review the decadal scientific progress of using Hg isotopes to understand 
      internal processes that modify the speciation, transport, and fate of Hg within 
      biota. Mercury stable isotopes have emerged as a powerful tool for assessing Hg 
      sources and biogeochemical processes in natural environments. A better 
      understanding of the tissue location and internal mechanisms leading to Hg 
      isotope change is key to assessing its use for biomonitoring. We synthesize the 
      current understanding and uncertainties of internal processes leading to Hg 
      isotope fractionation in a variety of biota, in a sequence of better to less 
      studied organisms (i.e., birds, marine mammals, humans, fish, plankton, and 
      invertebrates). This review discusses the opportunities and challenges of using 
      certain forms of biota for Hg source monitoring and the need to further elucidate 
      the physiological mechanisms that control the accumulation, distribution, and 
      toxicity of Hg in biota by coupling new techniques with Hg stable isotopes.

TI  - Seabirds subsidize terrestrial food webs and coral reefs in a tropical 
      rat-invaded archipelago.
PG  - e2733
LID - 10.1002/eap.2733 [doi]
AB  - Allochthonous resource fluxes mediated by organisms crossing ecosystem boundaries 
      may be essential for supporting the structure and function of resource-limited 
      environments, such as tropical islands and surrounding coral reefs. However, 
      invasive species, such as black rats, thrive on tropical islands and disrupt the 
      natural pathways of nutrient subsidies by reducing seabird colonies. Here, we 
      used stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon to examine the role of seabirds in 
      subsidizing the terrestrial food webs and adjacent coral reefs in the Abrolhos 
      Archipelago, Southwest Atlantic Ocean. By sampling invasive rats and multiple 
      ecosystem compartments (soil, plants, grasshoppers, tarantulas, and lizards) 
      within and outside seabird colonies, we showed that seabird subsidies led to an 
      overall enrichment in (15) N across the food web on islands. However, contrary to 
      other studies, δ(15) N values were consistently lower within the seabird 
      colonies, suggesting that a higher seabird presence might produce a localized 
      depletion in (15) N in small islands influenced by seabirds. In contrast, the 
      nitrogen content (%N) in plants and soils was higher inside the colonies, 
      corresponding to a higher effect of seabirds at the base of the trophic web. 
      Among consumers, lizards and invasive rats seemed to obtain allochthonous 
      resources from subsidized terrestrial organisms outside the colony. Inside the 
      colony, however, they showed a more direct consumption of marine matter, 
      suggesting that subsidies benefit these native and invasive animals both directly 
      and indirectly. Nonetheless, in coral reefs, scleractinian corals assimilated 
      seabird-derived nitrogen only around the two smaller and lower-elevation islands, 
      as demonstrated by the substantially higher δ(15) N values in relation to the 
      reference areas. This provides evidence that island morphology may influence the 
      incorporation of seabird nutrients in coral reefs around rat-invaded islands, 
      likely because guano lixiviation toward seawater is facilitated in small and 
      low-elevation terrains. Overall, these results showed that seabirds affected 
      small islands across all trophic levels within and outside colonies and that 
      these effects spread outward to coral reefs, evidencing resiliency of seabird 
      subsidies even within a rat-invaded archipelago. Because rats are consumers of 
      seabird chicks and eggs, however, rat eradication could potentially benefit the 
      terrestrial and nearshore ecosystems through increased subsides carried by 
      seabirds.

TI  - Anthropogenic subsidies alter stream consumer-resource stoichiometry, 
      biodiversity, and food chains.
PG  - 376-89
AB  - Urbanization is dramatically changing nutrient and organic matter regimes in 
      streams, yet the community and ecosystem implications often remain obscure. We 
      assessed the consequences of sewage-derived particulate organic matter (SDPOM) 
      for invertebrate community structure and function in a headwater stream. Using 
      stable isotope analyses, we found assimilation of organic SDPOM to double 
      community secondary production, and stoichiometric analyses revealed SDPOM 
      enriched in phosphorus (P) to foster putatively fast-growing, P-rich consumers in 
      the subsidized reach. This altered consumer-resource stoichiometry impacted both 
      community structure and nutrient fluxes through the invertebrate community. 
      Community structure shifted toward significantly reduced diversity and evenness 
      in the subsidized reach and consequently toward shorter food chains. Our 
      integration of ecological stoichiometry with stable isotope analyses and food web 
      ecology expands the previous focus of traditional ecotoxicology and ecophysiology 
      to an ecosystem-level appreciation of pollutant ecology.

AB  - The food and feeding links and sources in an impacted tropical estuary situated 
      along India's western coast, the Ulhas River Estuary (URE) was analyzed employing 
      the stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures (δ(13)C and δ(15)N). Three 
      basal carbon sources, such as mangrove leaves, particulate organic matter 
      (phytoplankton), and detritus, were analyzed together with eight consumer groups 
      from various trophic guilds. The δ(13)C varied from - 19.67 to - 24.61‰, whereas 
      δ(15)N ranged from 6.31 to 15.39‰ from the primary consumer to the top predator 
      species. The stable isotope mixing model developed for URE revealed a 
      phytoplankton based pelagic food chain and detritus based benthic food chain in 
      URE. The fairly larger value of SEA (Standard Ellipse Area) in the URE suggest a 
      much broader food web structure and high trophic diversity in the ecosystem. 
      Higher influence of detritus on the assimilated diet of majority of consumers and 
      evidences of nitrogen enrichment in the basal sources such as detritus and 
      particulate organic matter by anthropogenic activities in URE point towards 
      nitrogen pollution and subsequent trophic disturbance in this tropical estuarine 
      ecosystem.

TI  - A review of global environmental mercury processes in response to human and 
      natural perturbations: Changes of emissions, climate, and land use.
PG  - 116-140
LID - 10.1007/s13280-017-1004-9 [doi]
AB  - We review recent progress in our understanding of the global cycling of mercury 
      (Hg), including best estimates of Hg concentrations and pool sizes in major 
      environmental compartments and exchange processes within and between these 
      reservoirs. Recent advances include the availability of new global datasets 
      covering areas of the world where environmental Hg data were previously lacking; 
      integration of these data into global and regional models is continually 
      improving estimates of global Hg cycling. New analytical techniques, such as Hg 
      stable isotope characterization, provide novel constraints of sources and 
      transformation processes. The major global Hg reservoirs that are, and continue 
      to be, affected by anthropogenic activities include the atmosphere (4.4-5.3 Gt), 
      terrestrial environments (particularly soils: 250-1000 Gg), and aquatic 
      ecosystems (e.g., oceans: 270-450 Gg). Declines in anthropogenic Hg emissions 
      between 1990 and 2010 have led to declines in atmospheric Hg(0) concentrations 
      and Hg(II) wet deposition in Europe and the US (- 1.5 to - 2.2% per year). 
      Smaller atmospheric Hg(0) declines (- 0.2% per year) have been reported in high 
      northern latitudes, but not in the southern hemisphere, while increasing 
      atmospheric Hg loads are still reported in East Asia. New observations and 
      updated models now suggest high concentrations of oxidized Hg(II) in the tropical 
      and subtropical free troposphere where deep convection can scavenge these Hg(II) 
      reservoirs. As a result, up to 50% of total global wet Hg(II) deposition has been 
      predicted to occur to tropical oceans. Ocean Hg(0) evasion is a large source of 
      present-day atmospheric Hg (approximately 2900 Mg/year; range 1900-4200 Mg/year). 
      Enhanced seawater Hg(0) levels suggest enhanced Hg(0) ocean evasion in the 
      intertropical convergence zone, which may be linked to high Hg(II) deposition. 
      Estimates of gaseous Hg(0) emissions to the atmosphere over land, long considered 
      a critical Hg source, have been revised downward, and most terrestrial 
      environments now are considered net sinks of atmospheric Hg due to substantial Hg 
      uptake by plants. Litterfall deposition by plants is now estimated at 
      1020-1230 Mg/year globally. Stable isotope analysis and direct flux measurements 
      provide evidence that in many ecosystems Hg(0) deposition via plant inputs 
      dominates, accounting for 57-94% of Hg in soils. Of global aquatic Hg releases, 
      around 50% are estimated to occur in China and India, where Hg drains into the 
      West Pacific and North Indian Oceans. A first inventory of global freshwater Hg 
      suggests that inland freshwater Hg releases may be dominated by artisanal and 
      small-scale gold mining (ASGM; approximately 880 Mg/year), industrial and 
      wastewater releases (220 Mg/year), and terrestrial mobilization 
      (170-300 Mg/year). For pelagic ocean regions, the dominant source of Hg is 
      atmospheric deposition; an exception is the Arctic Ocean, where riverine and 
      coastal erosion is likely the dominant source. Ocean water Hg concentrations in 
      the North Atlantic appear to have declined during the last several decades but 
      have increased since the mid-1980s in the Pacific due to enhanced atmospheric 
      deposition from the Asian continent. Finally, we provide examples of ongoing and 
      anticipated changes in Hg cycling due to emission, climate, and land use changes. 
      It is anticipated that future emissions changes will be strongly dependent on 
      ASGM, as well as energy use scenarios and technology requirements implemented 
      under the Minamata Convention. We predict that land use and climate change 
      impacts on Hg cycling will be large and inherently linked to changes in ecosystem 
      function and global atmospheric and ocean circulations. Our ability to predict 
      multiple and simultaneous changes in future Hg global cycling and human exposure 
      is rapidly developing but requires further enhancement.

LID - 21762
AB  - This study investigated the Zarrin-Gol River ecosystem in Iran to trace organic 
      matter in the food web and evaluate the impact of aquaculture farm effluent using 
      stable isotopes of nitrogen (δ(15)N) and carbon (δ(13)C). Using a 
      previously-developed model (Islam 2005), we estimated that a trout farm in the 
      vicinity released 1.4 tons of nitrogen into the river. This was comparable to an 
      estimated total nutrient load of 2.1 tons of nitrogen for the six-month 
      fish-rearing period based on a web-based constituent load estimator (LOADEST). A 
      model estimate of river nitrogen concentration at the time of minimum river 
      discharge (100 L/s) was 2.74 mg/L. Despite relatively high nitrogen loading from 
      the farm, isotope data showed typical food web structure. Several biological 
      groups had elevated δ(13)C or δ(15)N values, but there was limited evidence for 
      the entry of organic matter from the trout farm into the food web, with sites 
      above and below trout farms having inconsistent patterns in (15)N enrichment. By 
      coupling nitrogen load modeling with stable isotope analysis we showed that 
      stable isotopes might not be effective tracers of organic matter into food webs, 
      depending on surrounding land use and other point sources of nutrients. The 
      Zarrin-Gol River ecosystem, like other basins with high human population density, 
      remains vulnerable to eutrophication in part due to trout farm effluent.

TI  - Functional traits explain trophic allometries of cephalopods.
PG  - 2692-2703
LID - 10.1111/1365-2656.13333 [doi]
AB  - Individual body size strongly influences the trophic role of marine organisms and 
      the structure and function of marine ecosystems. Quantifying trophic 
      position-individual body size relationships (trophic allometries) underpins the 
      development of size-structured ecosystem models to predict abundance and the 
      transfer of energy through ecosystems. Trophic allometries are well studied for 
      fishes but remain relatively unexplored for cephalopods. Cephalopods are 
      important components of coastal, oceanic and deep-sea ecosystems, and they play a 
      key role in the transfer of biomass from low trophic positions to higher 
      predators. It is therefore important to resolve cephalopod trophic allometries to 
      accurately represent them within size-structured ecosystem models. We assessed 
      the trophic positions of cephalopods in an oceanic pelagic (0-500 m) community 
      (sampled by trawling in a cold-core eddy in the western Tasman Sea), comprising 
      22 species from 12 families, using bulk tissue stable isotope analysis and amino 
      acid compound-specific stable isotope analysis. We assessed whether ontogenetic 
      trophic position shifts were evident at the species-level and tested for the best 
      predictor of community-level trophic allometry among body size, taxonomy and 
      functional grouping (informed by fin and mantle morphology). Individuals in this 
      cephalopod community spanned two trophic positions and fell into three functional 
      groups on an activity level gradient: low, medium and high. The relationship 
      between trophic position and ontogeny varied among species, with the most marked 
      differences evident between species from different functional groups. 
      Activity-level-based functional group and individual body size are best explained 
      by cephalopod trophic positions (marginal R(2)  = 0.43). Our results suggest that 
      the morphological traits used to infer activity level, such as fin-to-mantle 
      length ratio, fin musculature and mantle musculature are strong predictors of 
      cephalopod trophic allometries. Contrary to established theory, not all 
      cephalopods are voracious predators. Low activity level cephalopods have a 
      distinct feeding mode, with low trophic positions and little-to-no ontogenetic 
      increases. Given the important role of cephalopods in marine ecosystems, distinct 
      feeding modes could have important consequences for energy pathways and ecosystem 
      structure and function. These findings will facilitate trait-based and other 
      model estimates of cephalopod abundance in the changing global ocean.

AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have attracted scientific and 
      regulatory attention due to their persistence, bioaccumulative potential, 
      toxicity, and global distribution. We determined the accumulation and trophic 
      transfer of 14 PFASs (5 short-chain and 9 long-chain) within the food web of the 
      Yadkin-Pee Dee River of North Carolina and South Carolina, US. Food web 
      components and pathways were determined by stable isotope analyses of producers, 
      consumers, and organic matter. Analyses of water, sediment, organic matter, and 
      aquatic biota revealed that PFASs were prevalent in all food web compartments. 
      Biofilm, an aggregation of bacteria, fungi, algae, and protozoans and a basal 
      resource for the aquatic food web, showed high PFAS accumulation (in 10 of 14 
      compounds), particularly for perfluorooctanoic acid, with the greatest mean 
      concentration of 463.73 ng/g. The food web compartment with the most detections 
      and greatest concentrations of PFASs was aquatic insects; all 14 PFASs were 
      detected in individual aquatic insect samples (range of <limit of detection 
      [<LOD] to 1670.10 ng/g of wet weight [WW]). These findings may suggest a trophic 
      link between biofilm PFASs and aquatic insect PFASs. Individual fish tissue 
      samples ranged from <LOD to 797.00 ng/g of WW, where perfluorooctanesulfonate 
      (PFOS) was the dominant PFAS among all samples (64%). The ova of an imperiled 
      fish, the robust redhorse (Moxostoma robustum), had concentrations of 10 PFASs 
      (range of <LOD to 482.88 ng/g of WW) and the highest PFOS concentration (482.88 
      ng/g of WW), indicating a likely maternal transfer. The trophic magnification 
      factors (TMFs) calculated in this study showed that various taxa accumulated PFAS 
      compounds differently. PFBS, a short-chain PFAS compound that would presumably 
      exhibit lesser TMFs, had nine values among our compartments and organisms >1.0 
      (range of 0.57 to 2.33); it is possible that an unmeasured PFBS precursor may be 
      accumulating in biota and metabolizing to PFBS, leading to a higher than expected 
      TMFs for this compound. Our findings demonstrate the prevalence of PFASs in a 
      freshwater food web with potential implications for ecological and human health.

AB  - To understand the impact reduced mercury (Hg) loading and invasive species have 
      had on methylmercury bioaccumulation in predator fish of Lake Michigan, we 
      reconstructed bioaccumulation trends from a fish archive (1978 to 2012). By 
      measuring fish Hg stable isotope ratios, we related temporal changes in Hg 
      concentrations to varying Hg sources. Additionally, dietary tracers were 
      necessary to identify food web influences. Through combined Hg, C, and N stable 
      isotopic analyses, we were able to differentiate between a shift in Hg sources to 
      fish and periods when energetic transitions (from dreissenid mussels) led to the 
      assimilation of contrasting Hg pools (2000 to present). In the late 1980s, lake 
      trout δ(202)Hg increased (0.4‰) from regulatory reductions in regional Hg 
      emissions. After 2000, C and N isotopes ratios revealed altered food web 
      pathways, resulting in a benthic energetic shift and changes to Hg 
      bioaccumulation. Continued increases in δ(202)Hg indicate fish are responding to 
      several United States mercury emission mitigation strategies that were initiated 
      circa 1990 and continued through the 2011 promulgation of the Mercury and Air 
      Toxics Standards rule. Unlike archives of sediments, this fish archive tracks Hg 
      sources susceptible to bioaccumulation in Great Lakes fisheries. Analysis reveals 
      that trends in fish Hg concentrations can be substantially affected by shifts in 
      trophic structure and dietary preferences initiated by invasive species in the 
      Great Lakes. This does not diminish the benefits of declining emissions over this 
      period, as fish Hg concentrations would have been higher without these actions.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) is a serious concern for aquatic ecosystems because it may 
      biomagnify to harmful concentrations within food webs and consequently end up in 
      humans that eat fish. However, the trophic transfer of mercury through the 
      aquatic food web may be impacted by several factors related to network complexity 
      and the ecology of the species present. The present study addresses the interplay 
      between trophic ecology and mercury contamination in the fish communities of two 
      lakes in a pollution-impacted subarctic watercourse, exploring the role of both 
      horizontal (feeding habitat) and vertical (trophic position) food web 
      characteristics as drivers for the Hg contamination in fish. The lakes are 
      located in the upper and lower parts of the watercourse, with the lower site 
      located closer to, and downstream from, the main pollution source. The lakes have 
      complex fish communities dominated by coregonids (polymorphic whitefish and 
      invasive vendace) and several piscivorous species. Analyses of habitat use, 
      stomach contents, and stable isotope signatures (δ(15) N, δ(13) C) revealed 
      similar food web structures in the two lakes except for a few differences chiefly 
      related to ecological effects of the invasive vendace. The piscivores had higher 
      Hg concentrations than invertebrate-feeding fish. Concentrations increased with 
      size and age for the piscivores and vendace, whereas habitat differences were of 
      minor importance. Most fish species showed significant differences in Hg 
      concentrations between the lakes, the highest values typically found in the 
      downstream site where the biomagnification rate also was higher. Mercury levels 
      in piscivorous fish included concentrations that exceed health authorization 
      limits, with possible negative implications for fishing and human consumption. 
      Our findings accentuate the importance of acquiring detailed knowledge of the 
      drivers that can magnify Hg concentrations in fish and how these may vary within 
      and among aquatic systems, to provide a scientific basis for adequate management 
      strategies. Environ Toxicol Chem 2023;42:873-887. © 2023 SETAC.

AB  - Although many attempts have been carried out to elaborate trophic magnification 
      factor (TMF) and biomagnification factor (BMF), such as normalizing the 
      concentration of pollutants and averaging diet sources, the uncertainty of the 
      indexes still need to be improved to assess the bioaccumulation of pollutants. 
      This study first suggests an improved BMF (i.e., BMF') applied to mercury 
      bioaccumulation in freshwater fish from four sites before and after rainfall. The 
      diet source and TP of each fish were identified using nitrogen stable isotope of 
      amino acids (δ(15)N(AAs)) combined with bulk carbon stable isotope (δ(13)C). The 
      BMF' was calculated normalizing with TP and diet contributions derived from 
      MixSIAR. The BMF' values (1.3-27.2 and 1.2-27.8), which are representative of the 
      entire food web, were generally higher than TMF (1.5-13.9 and 1.5-14.5) for both 
      total mercury and methyl mercury, respectively. The BMF' implying actual mercury 
      transfer pathway is more reliable index than relatively underestimated TMF for 
      risk assessment. The ecological approach for BMF calculations provides novel 
      insight into the behavior and trophic transfer of pollutants like mercury.

AB  - Urban environments are unique because fragments of natural or semi-natural 
      habitat are embedded within a potentially permeable matrix of human-dominated 
      areas, creating increased landscape and, potentially, habitat heterogeneity. In 
      addition, urban areas can provide diet subsidies for wildlife species in the form 
      of fruiting ornamental plants, trash, and domestic animals. Ecological 
      opportunity in the forms of habitat and food heterogeneity are thought to be 
      important mechanisms in maintaining individual specialization. Identifying which 
      contexts, traits, and mechanisms determine the success or failure of individuals 
      within an urban wildlife population could potentially provide predictions about 
      which populations may succeed in human-dominated landscapes and which may 
      experience local extinction. We used both scat and stable isotope analysis of 
      whiskers to investigate the degree to which coyotes (Canis latrans) utilized 
      anthropogenic subsidies and exhibited individual diet specialization across the 
      urban-rural gradient in southern California. Land use surrounding scat and 
      isotope sample locations was also evaluated to determine the effect of land cover 
      on diet. Human food constituted a significant portion of urban coyote diet (22% 
      of scats, 38% of diet estimated by stable isotope analysis). Domestic cats (Felis 
      catus) and ornamental fruit and seeds were also important items in urban coyote 
      diets. Consumption of anthropogenic items decreased with decreasing urbanization. 
      In suburban areas, seasonality influenced the frequency of occurrence of 
      anthropogenic subsidies with increased consumption in the dry season. The amount 
      of altered open space (areas such as golf courses, cemeteries, and landscaped 
      parks) nearby had a negative effect on the consumption of anthropogenic items in 
      both urban and suburban areas. Contrary to our hypothesis, urban coyotes 
      displayed reduced between-individual variation compared to suburban and rural 
      coyotes. It is possible that the core urban areas of cities are so densely 
      developed and subsidized that wildlife inhabiting these areas actually have 
      reduced ecological opportunity. Suburban animals had the broadest isotopic niches 
      and maintained similar individual specialization to rural coyotes. Wildlife in 
      suburban areas still have access to relatively undisturbed natural areas while 
      being able to take advantage of anthropogenic subsidies in neighboring 
      residential areas. Therefore, areas with intermediate urban development may be 
      associated with increased ecological opportunity and specialization.

AB  - Trophic ecology studies on predator-prey interactions reveal insights into 
      ecological communities and help understand a species' role in the food web by 
      contributing to improved fisheries management and conservation capabilities. 
      Understanding the ecological role of overexploited and endangered predators is 
      essential to deciphering how their feeding behaviour influences food web 
      dynamics. In this study, the authors investigated the feeding behaviour of the 
      common and IUCN-listed Near Threatened (NT) thornback ray Raja clavata, using 
      carbon and nitrogen stable isotope and stomach content analysis (SCA). It has 
      recently suffered an 87% decline in reported catches from the Sea of Marmara 
      within the last decade. These results show that thornback ray mainly feeds on 
      teleost species, except in summer, with both methods showing this species changes 
      its diet ontogenetically by SCA. This ontogenetic diet shift was at lengths 
      40-50 cm by changing group preferences from Crustacea to Teleostei. MixSIAR 
      results showed that both adult and juvenile individuals of R. clavata feed mainly 
      on the crustaceans, but the contribution of teleosts represented by Trachurus sp. 
      was very low (<15%). The trophic position increased total length and was higher 
      than other batoid species in the Sea of Marmara.

      a coastal marine ecosystem using stable isotope (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) analysis.

AB  - Boat Harbour, Nova Scotia was a tidal estuary that was converted into a 
      wastewater treatment facility for pulp mill effluent in 1967. Treated effluent 
      from Boat Harbour was discharged into the coastal Northumberland Strait, 
      contributing significant nutrient and freshwater inputs into the coastal 
      environment, potentially impacting local biogeochemistry and ecosystem structure. 
      This study used stable isotope analysis of carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) 
      of representative taxa to assess spatial variability in nutrient sources and 
      trophic dynamics. Results identified stable isotope variation with depleted 
      δ(13)C and δ(15)N values in taxa near Boat Harbour. Blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) 
      and mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus) were the most suitable bioindicators for 
      identifying variation in nutrient sources. Stable isotope signatures in this 
      study may be reflective of residual pulp mill effluent-derived nutrients, 
      differences in marine versus terrestrial nutrient sources, and a pronounced 
      coastal salinity gradient. The present study defined the baseline nutrient 
      conditions of the Northumberland Strait and will be useful in assessing the 
      effectiveness of remediation activities.

      Ecology in Arctic Beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) Populations.
PG  - 271-281
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.1c05389 [doi]
AB  - We assessed long-term changes in the feeding ecology and mercury (Hg) 
      accumulation in Eastern High Arctic-Baffin Bay beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) 
      using total Hg and stable isotope (δ(13)C, δ(15)N) assays in teeth samples from 
      historical (1854-1905) and modern (1985-2000) populations. Mean δ(13)C values in 
      teeth declined significantly over time, from -13.01 ± 0.55‰ historically to 
      -14.41 ± 0.28‰ in 2000, while no consistent pattern was evident for δ(15)N due to 
      high individual variability within each period. The temporal shift in isotopic 
      niche is consistent with beluga feeding ecology changing in recent decades to a 
      more pelagic and less isotopically diverse diet or an ecosystem wide change in 
      isotope profiles. Mercury concentrations in modern beluga teeth were 3-5 times 
      higher on average than those in historical beluga. These results are similar to 
      the long-term trends of Hg and feeding ecology reported in other beluga 
      populations and in other Arctic marine predators. Similar feeding ecology shifts 
      across regions and species indicate a consistent increased pelagic diet response 
      to climate change as the Arctic Ocean progressively warmed and lost sea ice. 
      Previously, significant temporal Hg increase in beluga and other Arctic animals 
      was attributed solely to direct inputs of anthropogenic Hg from long-range 
      sources. Recent advances in understanding the Arctic marine Hg cycle suggest an 
      additional, complementary possibility─increased inputs of terrestrial Hg of mixed 
      anthropogenic-natural origin, mobilized from permafrost and other Arctic soils by 
      climate warming. At present, it is not possible to assign relative importance to 
      the two processes in explaining the rise of Hg concentrations in modern Arctic 
      marine predators.

AB  - Plant invasions can fundamentally alter detrital inputs and the structure of 
      detritus-based food webs. We examined the detrital pathways in mangrove food webs 
      in native (Puerto Rican) and introduced (Hawaiian) Rhizophora mangle forests 
      using a dual isotope approach and a mixing model. Based on trophic-level 
      fractionation of 0-1 per thousand for delta(13)C and 2-3 per thousand for 
      delta(15)N, among the invertebrates, only nematodes, oligochaetes, and nereid 
      polychaetes from native mangroves exhibited stable isotopes consistent with a 
      mangrove-derived diet. Certain fauna, in particular tubificid oligochaetes, had 
      delta(13)C values consistent with the consumption of mangrove leaves, but they 
      were depleted in (15)N, suggesting their primary nitrogen source was low in 
      (15)N, and was possibly N(2)-fixing bacteria. In introduced mangroves, all 
      feeding groups appeared to rely heavily on non-mangrove sources, especially 
      phytoplankton inputs. Mixing model results and discriminant analysis showed clear 
      separation of introduced and native mangrove sites based on differential food 
      source utilization within feeding groups, with stronger and more diverse use of 
      benthic foods observed in native forests. Observed differences between native and 
      invasive mangrove food webs may be due to Hawaiian detritivores being poorly 
      adapted to utilizing the tannin-rich, nitrogen-poor mangrove detritus. In 
      addition, differential utilization of mangrove detritus between native and 
      introduced mangroves may be a consequence of forest age. We postulate that 
      increasing mangrove forest age may promote diversification of bacterial food webs 
      important in N and S cycling. Our results also suggest a potentially important 
      role for sulfur bacteria in supporting the most abundant infaunal consumers, 
      nematodes, in the most mature systems.

AB  - Predator-prey interactions shape ecosystem stability and are influenced by 
      changes in ecosystem productivity. However, because multiple biotic and abiotic 
      drivers shape the trophic responses of predators to productivity, we often 
      observe patterns, but not mechanisms, by which productivity drives food web 
      structure. One way to capture mechanisms shaping trophic responses is to quantify 
      trophic interactions among multiple trophic groups and by using complementary 
      metrics of trophic ecology. In this study, we combine two diet-tracing methods: 
      diet DNA and stable isotopes, for two trophic groups (top predators and 
      intermediate predators) in both low- and high-productivity habitats to elucidate 
      where in the food chain trophic structure shifts in response to changes in 
      underlying ecosystem productivity. We demonstrate that while top predators show 
      increases in isotopic trophic position (δ(15)N) with productivity, neither their 
      isotopic niche size nor their DNA diet composition changes. Conversely, 
      intermediate predators show clear turnover in DNA diet composition towards a more 
      predatory prey base in high-productivity habitats. Taking this multi-trophic 
      approach highlights how predator identity shapes responses in predator-prey 
      interactions across environments with different underlying productivity, building 
      predictive power for understanding the outcomes of ongoing anthropogenic change.

AB  - Studies evaluating the mechanisms underpinning the biomagnification of 
      polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a globally prevalent group of regulated 
      persistent organic pollutants, commonly couple chemical and stable isotope 
      analyses to identify bioaccumulation pathways. Due to analytical costs 
      constraining the scope, sample size, and range of congeners analyzed, and 
      variation in methodologies preventing cross-study syntheses, how PCBs biomagnify 
      at food web, regional, and global scales remains uncertain. To overcome these 
      constraints, we compiled diet (stable isotopes) data and lipid-normalized 
      concentrations of sum total PCB (PCB(ST)), seven indicator PCB congeners, and 
      their sum (PCB(∑7)). Our analyses revealed that the number of congeners analyzed, 
      region, and class most strongly predicted PCB(ST), while similarly, region, 
      class, and feeding location best predicted PCB(∑7) and all seven congeners. We 
      also discovered that PCB(ST), PCB(∑7), and the seven indicator congeners all 
      occur in higher concentrations in freshwater than marine ecosystems but are more 
      likely to biomagnify in the latter. Moreover, although the seven congeners vary 
      in their propensity to biomagnify, their trophic magnification factors are all 
      generally greater in the Atlantic than the Pacific. Thus, novel insights 
      regarding PCB biomagnification across taxonomic, food webs, regional, and global 
      scales can be gleaned by leveraging existing data to overcome analytical 
      constraints.

AB  - Using a short food web, i.e. from prey (macro-algae) to predator (limpet), this 
      study investigated the concentrations and biomagnification of heavy metals from 
      macro-algae (Ralfsia verrucosa, Ulva lactuca and Gelidium pristoides) to limpet 
      (Scutellastra cochlear, S. longicosta, S. granularis and Cellana capensis) 
      species. Samples were collected from four sites (Mbhashe; Mthatha; Hluleka; 
      Silaka Mouth) in four seasons (winter 2019; spring 2019; summer 2020; spring 
      2020). In the laboratory samples were digested with the normal protocols, 
      subsequently analysed for heavy metals using inductively coupled plasma optical 
      emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), while δ(15)N and δ(13)C isotopes were analysed 
      with Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (IRMS). There were significant differences 
      of heavy metals concentration between species of macro-algae and limpet, and 
      metal concentration was species-specific. Spatio-temporal differences of (δ(13)C) 
      isotope was evident, indicating a wide source of energy. Using (δ(15)N) as a 
      proxy for biomagnification (BMF) of metals, As did not show any sign of 
      biomagnification (BMF<1) among all seasons and sites. Though mercury and Ni had 
      BMF >1, negative regression slope showed biodilution of these metals to the next 
      trophic level. The toxic Cd, Pb, and essential metals Zn and Cu indicated 
      possible biomagnification (BMF >1) between sites and seasons respectively. This 
      study showed that the selected limpet species are notable accumulators of heavy 
      metals and these contaminants have the potential to biomagnify in the next 
      trophic level suggesting that they are possibly unfit for human consumption in 
      these study sites.

AB  - The bioaccumulation and biomagnification of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in 
      the Lake Erie food web was investigated by analyzing surface water and biological 
      samples including 10 taxa of fish species, 2 taxa of benthos and zooplankton. The 
      carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) isotopic composition and fatty acids 
      profiles of biological samples were used to evaluate the food web structure and 
      assess the biomagnification of PFAS. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) dominated 
      the total PFAS (ΣPFAS) concentration (50-90% of ΣPFAS concentration), followed by 
      C9-C11 perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs). The highest PFOS concentrations 
      (79 ± 4.8 ng/g, wet weight (wwt)) and ΣPFAS (88 ± 5.2 ng/g, wwt) were detected in 
      yellow perch (Perca flavescens). The C8-C14 PFAS biomagnification factors (BMFs) 
      between apex piscivorous fish and prey fish were found to be generally greater 
      than 1, indicative of PFAS biomagnification, while biodilution (BMF<1) was 
      observed between planktivorous fish and zooplankton. Trophic magnification 
      factors (TMFs) of C8-C14 PFCA were not correlated with perfluoroalkyl chain 
      length. The C4-C9 PFAS were detected in the surface water of Lake Erie, and PFBA 
      was found to have the highest concentrations (2.1-2.8 ng/L) among all PFAS 
      detected. The log of bioaccumulation factor (BAF) was found to generally increase 
      with increasing log K(ow) for C6, 8, and 9 PFAS in all selected species from 
      three tropic levels.

AB  - Different from the widely used constant discrimination factor Δ(15)N = 3.4‰ 
      between two adjacent trophic positions (TPs), a scaled Δ(15)N framework for 
      evaluating the TP of species was developed in 2014, that is, the Δ(15)N between 
      two adjacent TPs decreases as the TP increases which is considered to be in 
      closer conformity to the trophic cascade in the natural food web. In this study, 
      we compared the two TP calculation methods and then reconsidered the evaluation 
      of the trophic magnification factors (TMFs). Our results show that the TP(scaled) 
      value is higher and the TMFs value is lower under the scaled Δ(15)N framework, 
      indicating that the TMFs value under the constant Δ(15)N framework is often 
      overestimated. We further constructed a diet proportion food web model, which 
      shows that species with lower TP has higher contribution rate as food sources. In 
      Xingkai Lake, the enrichment process of mercury in the food web is not strictly 
      consistent with the diet proportion of the food web. Based on the diet proportion 
      food web model and the mercury enrichment model, it can be found that the White 
      shrimp (Exopalaemon modestus) is not only an important food source, but also the 
      main source of mercury transmission in the food web. Overall, our findings have 
      quantified the food web construction and thus facilitated a better understanding 
      of the interaction between the diet proportion and the bio-concentration in the 
      food web.

AB  - The amount of energy consumed within an average city block is an order of 
      magnitude higher than that consumed in any other ecosystem over a similar area. 
      This is driven by human food inputs, but the consequence of these resources for 
      urban animal populations is poorly understood. We investigated the role of human 
      foods in ant diets across an urbanization gradient in Manhattan using carbon and 
      nitrogen stable isotopes. We found that some-but not all-ant species living in 
      Manhattan's most urbanized habitats had δ(13)C signatures associated with 
      processed human foods. In particular, pavement ants (Tetramorium sp. E) had 
      increased levels of δ(13)C similar to δ(13)C levels in human fast foods. The 
      magnitude of this effect was positively correlated with urbanization. By 
      contrast, we detected no differences in δ(15)N, suggesting Tetramorium feeds at 
      the same trophic level despite shifting to human foods. This pattern persisted 
      across the broader ant community; species in traffic islands used human resources 
      more than park species. Our results demonstrate that the degree urban ants 
      exploit human resources changes across the city and among species, and this 
      variation could play a key role in community structure and ecosystem processes 
      where human and animal food webs intersect.

      Arctic marine ecosystem.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) is a ubiquitous toxic metal that biomagnifies in food webs, and can 
      reach high concentrations in top predators. Evaluating Hg biomagnification in 
      Arctic marine food webs is critical for understanding Hg dynamics and estimating 
      exposure to understudied fish and wildlife consumed by humans. The majority of 
      studies conducted on Hg biomagnification in the Arctic have focused on pelagic 
      food webs. Benthic and benthopelagic food webs in Arctic marine ecosystems also 
      support many species of subsistence and commercial importance, and data are 
      lacking for these systems. In this study, we investigated food web structure and 
      Hg biomagnification for the benthic, pelagic, and benthopelagic marine food webs 
      of inner Frobisher Bay in Nunavut. Stable isotope ratios of carbon (δ(13)C) and 
      nitrogen (δ(15)N), as well as total (THg) and methyl (MeHg) mercury 
      concentrations were measured in fish, invertebrates, and zooplankton. 
      Biomagnification in each food web was quantified with Trophic Magnification 
      Slopes (TMS) and Trophic Magnification Factors (TMF). The highest TMS and TMF 
      values were exhibited by the benthopelagic food web (TMS = 0.201; TMF = 1.59), 
      followed by the pelagic food web (TMS = 0.183; TMF = 1.52), and lastly the 
      benthic food web (TMS = 0.079; TMF = 1.20), with δ(15)N explaining 88%, 79%, and 
      9% of variation in Hg concentrations, respectively. TMS and TMF values were 
      generally low compared to other Arctic marine food webs. Results from food web 
      structure analyses indicated that the benthic food web had the greatest trophic 
      diversity, trophic redundancy, and largest isotopic niche area of all food webs 
      studied. Greater food web complexity may thus result in reduced MeHg 
      biomagnification, but further study is required. Acquiring Hg and food web 
      structure data is critical for predicting the effects of climate-induced 
      environmental change on Hg dynamics, especially in the context of Arctic marine 
      ecosystems.

AB  - Empirical patterns that emerge from an examination of food webs over gradients of 
      environmental variation can help to predict the implications of anthropogenic 
      disturbance on ecosystems. This "dynamic food web approach" is rarely applied at 
      the coastal margin where aquatic and terrestrial systems are coupled and human 
      development activities are often concentrated. We propose a simple model of ghost 
      crab (Ocypode quadrata) feeding that predicts changing dominant prey (Emerita 
      talpoida, Talorchestia sp., Donax variablis) along a gradient of beach morphology 
      and test this model using a suite of 16 beaches along the Florida, USA coast. 
      Assessment of beaches included quantification of morphological features (width, 
      sediments, slope), macrophyte wrack, macro-invertebrate prey and active ghost 
      crab burrows. Stable isotope analysis of carbon ((13)C/(12)C) and nitrogen 
      ((15)N/(14)N) and the SIAR mixing model were used to determine dietary 
      composition of ghost crabs at each beach. The variation in habitat conditions 
      displayed with increasing beach width was accompanied by quantifiable shifts in 
      ghost crab diet and trophic position. Patterns of ghost crab diet were consistent 
      with differences recorded across the beach width gradient with respect to the 
      availability of preferred micro-habitats of principal macro-invertebrate prey. 
      Values obtained for trophic position also suggests that the generalist ghost crab 
      assembles and augments its diet in fundamentally different ways as habitat 
      morphology varies across a highly dynamic ecosystem. Our results offer support 
      for a functional response in the trophic architecture of a common food web 
      compartment (ghost crabs, macro-invertebrate prey) across well-known beach 
      morphologies. More importantly, our "dynamic food web approach" serves as a basis 
      for evaluating how globally wide-spread sandy beach ecosystems should respond to 
      a variety of anthropogenic impacts including beach grooming, beach 
      re-nourishment, introduction of non-native or feral predators and human traffic 
      on beaches.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities and climate change have significantly increased mercury 
      (Hg) levels in seawater. However, the processes and sources of Hg in differing 
      marine compartments (e.g. estuary, marine continental shelf (MCS) or pelagic 
      area) have not been well studied, which makes it difficult to understand Hg 
      cycling in marine ecosystems. To address this issue, the total Hg (THg) 
      concentration, methylmercury (MeHg) concentration and stable Hg isotopes were 
      determined in seawater and fish samples collected from differing marine 
      compartments of the South China Sea (SCS). The results showed that the estuarine 
      seawater exhibited substantially higher THg and MeHg concentrations than those in 
      the MCS and pelagic seawater. Significantly negative δ(202)Hg (-1.63‰ ± 0.42‰) in 
      estuarine seawater compared with that in pelagic seawater (-0.58‰ ± 0.08‰) may 
      suggest watershed input and domestic sewage discharge of Hg in the estuarine 
      compartment. The Δ(199)Hg value in estuarine fish (0.39‰ ± 0.35‰) was obviously 
      lower than that in MCS (1.10‰ ± 0.54‰) and pelagic fish (1.15‰ ± 0.46‰), which 
      showed that relatively little MeHg photodegradation occurred in the estuarine 
      compartment. The Hg isotope binary mixing model based on Δ(200)Hg revealed that 
      approximately 74% MeHg in pelagic fish is derived from atmospheric Hg(II) 
      deposition, and over 60% MeHg in MCS fish is derived from sediments. MeHg sources 
      for estuarine fish may be highly complex (e.g. sediment or riverine/atmospheric 
      input) and further investigations are warranted to clarify the contribution of 
      each source. Our study showed that Hg stable isotopes in seawater and marine fish 
      can be used to identify the processes and sources of Hg in different marine 
      compartments. This finding is of great relevance to the development of marine Hg 
      food web models and the management of Hg in fish.

TI  - Trophic Transfer of Halogenated Organic Pollutants in a Wetland Food Web:

      Analysis.

AB  - A trophic position (TP) model (TP(mix) model) that simultaneously considered 
      trophic discrimination factor and β(Glu/Phe) variations was developed in this 
      study and was first applied to investigate the trophic transfer of halogenated 
      organic pollutants (HOPs) in wetland food webs. The TP(mix) model characterized 
      the structure of the wetland food web more accurately and significantly improved 
      the reliability of TMF compared to the TP(bulk), TP(AAs), and TP(simmr) models, 
      which were calculated based on the methods of stable nitrogen isotope analysis of 
      bulk, traditional AAs-N-CSIA, and weighted β(Glu/Phe), respectively. Food source 
      analysis revealed three interlocking food webs (kingfisher, crab, and frogs) in 
      this wetland. The highest HOP biomagnification capacities (TMF(mix)) were found 
      in the kingfisher food web (0.24-82.0), followed by the frog (0.08-34.0) and crab 
      (0.56-11.7) food webs. The parabolic trends of TMF(mix) across combinations of 
      log K(OW) in the frog food web were distinct from those of aquatic food webs 
      (kingfisher and crab), which may be related to differences in food web 
      composition and HOP bioaccumulation behaviors between aquatic and terrestrial 
      organisms. This study provides a new tool to accurately study the trophic 
      transfer of contaminants in wetlands and terrestrial food webs with diverse 
      species and complex feeding relationships.

TI  - Feeding and contaminant patterns of sub-arctic and arctic ringed seals: Potential 
      insight into climate change-contaminant interactions.

AB  - To provide insight into how climate-driven diet shifts may impact contaminant 
      exposures of Arctic species, we compared feeding ecology and contaminant 
      concentrations in ringed seals (Pusa hispida) from two Canadian sub-Arctic (Nain 
      at 56.5°N, Arviat at 61.1°N) and two Arctic sites (Sachs Harbour at 72.0 °N, 
      Resolute Bay at 74.7 °N). In the sub-Arctic, empirical evidence of changing prey 
      fish communities has been documented, while less community change has been 
      reported in the Arctic to date, suggesting current sub-Arctic conditions may be a 
      harbinger of future Arctic conditions. Here, Indigenous partners collected 
      tissues from subsistence-harvested ringed seals in 2018. Blubber fatty acids 
      (FAs) and muscle stable isotopes (δ(15)N, δ(13)C) indicated dietary patterns, 
      while measured contaminants included heavy metals (e.g., total mercury (THg)), 
      legacy persistent organic pollutants (e.g., dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes 
      (DDTs)), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and per-/polyfluoroalkyl 
      substances (PFASs). FA signatures are distinct between sub-Arctic and Resolute 
      Bay seals, likely related to higher consumption of southern prey species 
      including capelin (Mallotus villosus) in the sub-Arctic but on-going feeding on 
      Arctic species in Resolute Bay. Sachs Harbour ringed seals show FA overlap with 
      all locations, possibly consuming both southern and endemic Arctic species. 
      Negative δ(13)C estimates for PFAS models suggest that more pelagic, sub-Arctic 
      type prey (e.g., capelin) increases PFAS concentrations, whereas the reverse 
      occurs for, e.g., THg, ΣPBDE, and ΣDDT. Inconsistent directionality of δ(15)N 
      estimates in the models likely reflects baseline isotopic variation not trophic 
      position differences. Adjusting for the influence of diet suggests that if Arctic 
      ringed seal diets become more like sub-Arctic seals due to climate change, 
      diet-driven increases may occur for newer contaminants like PFASs, but not for 
      more legacy contaminants. Nonetheless, temporal trends studies are still needed, 
      as are investigations into the potential confounding influence of baseline 
      isotope variation in spatial studies of contaminants in Arctic biota.

TI  - Stable Isotope Insights into Microplastic Contamination within Freshwater Food 
      Webs.
PG  - 1024-1035
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.0c06221 [doi]
AB  - Microplastic pollution and ingestion are ubiquitous phenomena in freshwater 
      ecosystems. However, our understanding of the role of trophic niche in 
      microplastic ingestion is still limited. Here, we quantified the level of 
      microplastic (700 μm to 5 mm) contamination for macroinvertebrates and fish 
      within the Garonne river. We then used stable isotope analyses (δ(13)C and 
      δ(15)N) to quantify trophic niches. We first demonstrated that the abundance of 
      ingested microplastics differed between macroinvertebrates and fish and was not 
      significantly related to microplastic pollution. We then found that microplastic 
      characteristics (shape, color, size, and polymer composition) differ between the 
      abiotic (surface waters and sediments) and biotic (ingested by macroinvertebrates 
      and fish) compartments. The abundance of ingested microplastics increased with 
      the size of organisms in both fish and macroinvertebrates and tended to increase 
      with trophic position in macroinvertebrates only. Finally, the origin of the 
      resources consumed by fish significantly affected the abundance of microplastics 
      ingested. Altogether, these results suggest the absence of microplastic 
      bioaccumulation in freshwater food webs and the dominance of direct consumption, 
      most likely accidentally. The use of stable isotope analyses is therefore crucial 
      to improve our understanding of microplastic ingestion by wild organisms.

TI  - The first global deep-sea stable isotope assessment reveals the unique trophic 
      ecology of Vampire Squid Vampyroteuthis infernalis (Cephalopoda).

AB  - Vampyroteuthis infernalis Chun, 1903, is a widely distributed deepwater 
      cephalopod with unique morphology and phylogenetic position. We assessed its 
      habitat and trophic ecology on a global scale via stable isotope analyses of a 
      unique collection of beaks from 104 specimens from the Atlantic, Pacific and 
      Indian Oceans. Cephalopods typically are active predators occupying a high 
      trophic level (TL) and exhibit an ontogenetic increase in δ(15)N and TL. Our 
      results, presenting the first global comparison for a deep-sea invertebrate, 
      demonstrate that V. infernalis has an ontogenetic decrease in δ(15)N and TL, 
      coupled with niche broadening. Juveniles are mobile zooplanktivores, while larger 
      Vampyroteuthis are slow-swimming opportunistic consumers and ingest particulate 
      organic matter. Vampyroteuthis infernalis occupies the same TL (3.0-4.3) over its 
      global range and has a unique niche in deep-sea ecosystems. These traits have 
      enabled the success and abundance of this relict species inhabiting the largest 
      ecological realm on the planet.

TI  - Ecological flexibility and adaptation to past climate change in the Middle Nile 
      Valley: A multiproxy investigation of dietary shifts between the Neolithic and 
      Kerma periods at Kadruka 1 and Kadruka 21.

AB  - Human responses to climate change have long been at the heart of discussions of 
      past economic, social, and political change in the Nile Valley of northeastern 
      Africa. Following the arrival of Neolithic groups in the 6th millennium BCE, the 
      Northern Dongola Reach of Upper Nubia witnessed a cultural florescence manifested 
      through elaborate funerary traditions. However, despite the wealth of 
      archaeological data available from funerary contexts, including evidence for 
      domesticated animals and plants as grave goods, the paucity of stratified 
      habitation contexts hinders interpretation of local subsistence trajectories. 
      While it is recognised archaeologically that, against the backdrop of increasing 
      environmental deterioration, the importance of agriculture based on Southwest 
      Asian winter cereals increased throughout the Kerma period (2500-1450 BCE), the 
      contribution of domesticated cereals to earlier Neolithic herding economies 
      remains unclear. This paper presents direct dietary data from a total of 55 
      Middle Neolithic and Kerma period individuals from Kadruka 21 and Kadruka 1. 
      Microbotanical data obtained from human dental calculus and grave sediments are 
      integrated with human and faunal stable isotopes to explore changes in dietary 
      breadth over time. The combined results demonstrate the consumption of wild plant 
      species, including C4 wetland adapted grasses, by Middle Neolithic individuals at 
      Kadruka 1. Despite existing evidence for domesticated barley in associated 
      graves, the results obtained in this study provide no clear evidence for the 
      routine consumption of domesticated cereals by Middle Neolithic individuals. 
      Rather, direct microparticle evidence for the consumption of Triticeae cereals is 
      only associated with a single Kerma period individual and corresponds with an 
      isotopic shift indicating a greater contribution of C3-derived resources to diet. 
      These results provide evidence for Neolithic dietary flexibility in Upper Nubia 
      through the persistence of foraging activities and support existing evidence 
      linking increased agricultural reliance to the development of the Kerma culture.

AB  - Coastal lagoons are often characterized by eutrophic conditions which are known 
      to impair the structure and functioning of both pelagic and benthic compartments. 
      However, the manner in which eutrophication triggers a series of cascade effects 
      in the whole food web in coastal lagoons has received little attention. Using 
      stable isotope (SI) analyses, we investigated the food web structure in the 
      hypertrophic lagoon of Yundang (Xiamen, China) in two periods of the year 
      characterized by the recurrent alternation of Ulva lactuca and phytoplankton 
      blooms in the cool (March) and warm (September) seasons, respectively. Large 
      temporal fluctuations in the dominance of primary producers (i.e. macroalgae vs. 
      phytoplankton) and, thus, in the available food items, were reflected in major 
      changes in the diet and SI signals of several primary consumers, such as the 
      amphipod Grandidierella japonica, the polychaetes Neanthes japonica and Capitella 
      capitata, and omnivorous fishes (i.e. Mugil cephalus, Oreochromis niloticus, and 
      Sardinella zunasi), while these changes were limited in top carnivorous fishes, 
      such as Lateolabrax japonicus. Furthermore, reduced macrozoobenthic abundance 
      available for omnivores in September was found to force omnivores to switch their 
      feeding habits to those of herbivores. The present study provides evidence that 
      the periodical alternation of macroalgal and phytoplankton blooms throughout the 
      year strongly affect the relations among different trophic levels leading to a 
      cascading effect across the whole food web and to major changes in the lagoon's 
      food web structure. Importantly, our study shows that the lagoon's food web 
      structure under persistent eutrophic conditions can still cope with seasonal 
      changes in primary energy source type from macroalgae to microalgae due to the 
      ability of omnivorous fishes to conduit different food sources up to the highest 
      trophic levels. Thus, this study suggests that in such a highly variable 
      eutrophic system, omnivores play a central role in the lagoon's functioning, and 
      help to sustain the biological resources and the ecosystem services provided by 
      the lagoon.

AB  - Agricultural expansion is among the main threats to biodiversity and functions of 
      tropical ecosystems. It has been shown that conversion of rainforest into 
      plantations erodes biodiversity, but further consequences for food-web structure 
      and energetics of belowground communities remains little explored. We used a 
      unique combination of stable isotope analysis and food-web energetics to analyze 
      in a comprehensive way consequences of the conversion of rainforest into oil palm 
      and rubber plantations on the structure of and channeling of energy through soil 
      animal food webs in Sumatra, Indonesia. Across the animal groups studied, most of 
      the taxa had lower litter-calibrated Δ(13)C values in plantations than in 
      rainforests, suggesting that they switched to freshly-fixed plant carbon ('fast' 
      energy channeling) in plantations from the detrital C pathway ('slow' energy 
      channeling) in rainforests. These shifts led to changes in isotopic divergence, 
      dispersion, evenness, and uniqueness. However, earthworms as major detritivores 
      stayed unchanged in their trophic niche and monopolized the detrital pathway in 
      plantations, resulting in similar energetic metrics across land-use systems. 
      Functional diversity metrics of soil food webs were associated with reduced 
      amount of litter, tree density, and species richness in plantations, providing 
      guidelines on how to improve the complexity of the structure of and channeling of 
      energy through soil food webs. Our results highlight the strong restructuring of 
      soil food webs with the conversion of rainforest into plantations threatening 
      soil functioning and ecosystem stability in the long term.

AB  - The biomagnification of Hg and Se was studied using nitrogen stable isotope 
      analysis during four seasons in a coastal lagoon of the eastern central Gulf of 
      California. This lagoon receives agricultural, municipal, and shrimp aquaculture 
      effluents. The species were categorized into organism groups and presented a 
      significant accumulation of Hg and Se with respect to the sources, while the 
      concentration of both elements in sediment and suspended particulate matter (SPM) 
      was low. Our data confirms the positive transfers (biomagnification factors >1) 
      of Hg and Se in the entire studied food web, and it was structured in five 
      trophic levels across all seasons. Additionally, there were no linear 
      correlations between the molar Se:Hg ratios and the trophic levels of the 
      organism groups. However, the Se:Hg ratios among organism groups were >1, which 
      indicates that there is an excess of Se and that it is not a limiting factor for 
      the detoxification of Hg.

AB  - The Mediterranean Sea remains a complex system for mercury (Hg) cycling and 
      accumulation in marine vertebrates. The extremely high levels these animals 
      present demand for an urgent understanding of such processes and the development 
      of new analytical techniques that go beyond the simple contamination monitoring. 
      It was often proposed that prey selection or habitat use may affect Hg 
      contamination in animals; however, it was never possible to measure which factor 
      influences more rates and pathways of contamination. In this paper, we directly 
      integrate toxicological information (Hg levels) and ecological tracers (stable 
      isotopes of C, N and S) into a common data analysis framework (isotopic niches), 
      with the aim of quantifying the influence of species' trophic behaviour on Hg 
      contamination. The analysis was conducted on skin biopsies of fin whales 
      Balaenoptera physalus, long-finned pilot whales Globicephala melas and sperm 
      whales Physeter microcephalus. Their different trophic modes and residency in the 
      area make them model species for the analysis of Hg accumulation along NWMS food 
      webs. We measured Total Hg (T-Hg) concentrations through absorbance spectrometry 
      with the DMA80 Milestone. Carbon, nitrogen and sulphur isotope compositions were 
      measured via mass spectrometry in an IRMS coupled to an Elemental Analyser (EA) 
      Isoprime. Comparison of ecological and contamination niches allowed to explain Hg 
      accumulation in Mediterranean marine predators. Factors such as food web 
      complexity, trophic position, hunting distribution or habitat use (e.g., foraging 
      depth) did not influence Hg exposure. It is rather the selection of prey type, 
      which determines the range of potential Hg sources and as a consequence the rates 
      of accumulation in whales' tissues. A generalist piscivorous species such as the 
      pilot whales will bioaccumulate more Hg than specialised sperm whales feeding 
      mostly on cephalopods.

TI  - Artificial lighting at night alters aquatic-riparian invertebrate food webs.
PG  - e01821
LID - 10.1002/eap.1821 [doi]
AB  - Artificial lighting at night (ALAN) is a global phenomenon that can be 
      detrimental to organisms at individual and population levels, yet potential 
      consequences for communities and ecosystem functions are less resolved. Riparian 
      systems may be particularly vulnerable to ALAN. We investigated the impacts of 
      ALAN on invertebrate community composition and food web characteristics for 
      linked aquatic-terrestrial ecosystems. We focused on food chain length (FCL), a 
      central property of ecological communities that can influence their structure, 
      function, and stability; and the contribution of aquatically derived energy 
      (i.e., nutritional subsidies originating from stream periphyton). We collected 
      terrestrial arthropods and emergent aquatic insects from a suite of stream and 
      wetland sites in Columbus, Ohio, USA. Stable isotopes of carbon ((13) C) and 
      nitrogen ((15) N) were used to infer FCL and contribution of aquatically derived 
      energy. We found that moderate-to-high levels of ALAN altered invertebrate 
      community composition, favoring primarily predators and detritivores. Impacts of 
      ALAN, however, were very taxon specific as illustrated, for example, by the 
      negative impact of ALAN on the abundance of orb-web spiders belonging to the 
      families Tetragnathidae and Araneidae: key invertebrate riparian predators. Most 
      notably, we observed decreases in both invertebrate FCL and reliance on 
      aquatically derived energy under ALAN (although aquatic energetic contributions 
      appeared to increase again at higher levels of ALAN), in addition to shifts in 
      the timing of reciprocal nutritional subsidies. Our study demonstrates that ALAN 
      can alter the flows of energy between aquatic and terrestrial systems, thereby 
      representing an environmental perturbation that can cross ecosystem boundaries. 
      Given projections for global increases in ALAN, both in terms of coverage and 
      intensity, these results have broad implications for stream ecosystem structure 
      and function.

TI  - Dietary niche expansion of a kelp forest predator recovering from intense 
      commercial exploitation.
PG  - 164-72
AB  - Marine ecosystems are increasingly at risk from overexploitation and fisheries 
      collapse. As managers implement recovery plans, shifts in species interactions 
      may occur broadly with potential consequences for ecosystem structure and 
      function. In kelp forests off San Nicolas Island, California, USA, we describe 
      striking changes in size structure and life history traits (e.g., size at 
      maturation and sex change) of a heavily fished, ecologically important predator, 
      the California sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher). These changes occurred in two 
      phases: (1) after intense commercial fishery exploitation in the late 1990s and 
      (2) following recovery in the late 2000s, nearly a decade after management 
      intervention. Using gut contents and stable-isotope values of sheephead and their 
      prey, we found evidence for a dietary niche expansion upon recovery of population 
      size structure to include increased consumption of sea urchins and other mobile 
      invertebrate grazers by larger sized fish. By examining historical diet data and 
      a time series of benthic community composition, we conclude that changes in 
      dietary niche breadth are more likely due to the recovery of size structure from 
      fishing than major shifts in prey availability. Size-dependent predator-prey 
      interactions may have ecosystem consequences and management measures that 
      preserve or restore size structure, and therefore historical trophic roles of key 
      predators, could be vital for maintaining kelp forest ecosystem health.

TI  - Seasonal variation in stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values of bats reflect 
      environmental baselines.
PG  - e0117052

LID - e0117052
AB  - The stable carbon and nitrogen isotope composition of animal tissues is commonly 
      used to trace wildlife diets and analyze food chains. Changes in an animal's 
      isotopic values over time are generally assumed to indicate diet shifts or, less 
      frequently, physiological changes. Although plant isotopic values are known to 
      correlate with climatic seasonality, only a few studies restricted to aquatic 
      environments have investigated whether temporal isotopic variation in consumers 
      may also reflect environmental baselines through trophic propagation. We modeled 
      the monthly variation in carbon and nitrogen isotope values in whole blood of 
      four insectivorous bat species occupying different foraging niches in southern 
      Spain. We found a common pattern of isotopic variation independent of feeding 
      habits, with an overall change as large as or larger than one trophic step. 
      Physiological changes related to reproduction or to fat deposition prior to 
      hibernation had no effect on isotopic variation, but juvenile bats had higher 
      δ13C and δ15N values than adults. Aridity was the factor that best explained 
      isotopic variation: bat blood became enriched in both 13C and 15N after hotter 
      and/or drier periods. Our study is the first to show that consumers in 
      terrestrial ecosystems reflect seasonal environmental dynamics in their isotope 
      values. We highlight the danger of misinterpreting stable isotope data when not 
      accounting for seasonal isotopic baselines in food web studies. Understanding how 
      environmental seasonality is integrated in animals' isotope values will be 
      crucial for developing reliable methods to use stable isotopes as dietary 
      tracers.

AB  - After the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP), Japan, 
      in March 2011, (137)Cs in demersal fish had, between 2011 and 2015, a prolonged 
      ecological half-life when compared to pelagic fish. Using stable isotope mixing 
      models combined with gut content analysis and (137)Cs activity concentrations, 
      this study investigated the hypothesis that an unexplored food web structure 
      could be a contributing factor explaining the ecological half-life of (137)Cs in 
      benthic flatfish. Benthic invertebrates and demersal fish species sampled in 2015 
      still showed (137)Cs activity concentrations higher than pre-accident. The mixing 
      models of stable N and C isotopes and gut content analysis identified deposit, 
      suspension and filter feeders to be the main flatfish food items in the benthos. 
      There was a significant correlation between (137)Cs activity concentrations in 
      specific flatfish species and benthos, and between (137)Cs activity 
      concentrations in benthos and surface sediment. The results of this study 
      partially explained the (137)Cs activity concentrations found in the analysed 
      demersal fish, suggesting that the benthos can be a continuous source of (137)Cs 
      for the demersal fish during this period of time. Extending monitoring programmes 
      to include invertebrates that are not food species for humans would greatly 
      improve our ability to understand the role of trophic transfer pathways and take 
      appropriate management actions.

      regions worldwide, anthropogenic contamination has seriously degraded groundwater 
      quality. Properly elucidating geochemical processes, quantifying contributions of 
      natural and anthropogenic end members, and then protecting karst aquifer systems 
      remain challenging from scientific and engineering aspects. To identify the 
      hydrochemical processes and quantifying contributions of end members (especially, 
      contamination end members), 49 samples were collected from cave waters (CW), 
      artesian springs (AS), and gravity springs (GS) in a karst watershed in Guiyang, 
      China. With increased anthropogenic contamination, the CW, AS, and GS 
      characterized by a Ca-Mg-SO(4)(2-)-HCO(3)(-) composition often had pH and 
      SO(4)(2-) concentrations exceeding USEPA secondary drinking water standards. That 
      is attributed to the influence of water-rock interaction, rainfall, and 
      anthropogenic sources (mainly, sewage and fertilizers), in agreement with the 
      compositions of δ(34)S(SO4), δ(18)O(SO4), and (87)Sr/(86)Sr as well as the 
      results of principal component analysis and correlation coefficients. Based on an 
      end-member mixing model, contributions of rainfall and anthropogenic sources were 
      47% and 33% of GS, 52% and 41% of CW, and 58% and 35% of AS, respectively. It 
      suggests that the karst groundwater quality is predominantly controlled by 
      rainfall and anthropogenic sources (especially, land use). Results may be applied 
      to properly evaluate the impacts of natural and anthropogenic sources on karst 
      aquifers, coupled with actions to efficiently control potential contamination end 
      members.

      Guiyang (Supporting Information (SI) Figure S1), which lies in a wide karst 
      valley basin with an elevation of approximately 1000 m. The geologic setting is 
      complex due to extensive faulting, fissures, and conduits. The majority of 
      aquifers are pre-Jurassic carbonate (dolomite and limestone, accounting for more 
      than 80% of the aquifers) and clastic sedimentary rocks (sandstone and shale) (SI 
      Figure S1; SI Table S1). The climate is subtropical warm-moist with an annual 
      average temperature of 15.3 °C. About 80% of the annual precipitation (1200 mm) 
      falls from May to October (Han and Jin, 1996).

AB  - While an increasing number of studies are adopting molecular and chemical methods 
      for dietary characterization, these studies often employ only one of these 
      laboratory-based techniques; this approach may yield an incomplete, or even 
      biased, understanding of diet due to each method's inherent limitations. To 
      explore the utility of coupling molecular and chemical techniques for dietary 
      characterizations, we applied DNA metabarcoding alongside stable isotope analysis 
      to characterize the dietary niche of breeding Louisiana waterthrush (Parkesia 
      motacilla), a migratory songbird hypothesized to preferentially provision its 
      offspring with pollution-intolerant, aquatic arthropod prey. While DNA 
      metabarcoding was unable to determine if waterthrush provision aquatic and 
      terrestrial prey in different abundances, we found that specific aquatic taxa 
      were more likely to be detected in successive seasons than their terrestrial 
      counterparts, thus supporting the aquatic specialization hypothesis. Our isotopic 
      analysis added greater context to this hypothesis by concluding that breeding 
      waterthrush provisioned Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera, two pollution-intolerant, 
      aquatic orders, in higher quantities than other prey groups, and expanded their 
      functional trophic niche when such prey were not abundantly provisioned. Finally, 
      we found that the dietary characterizations from each approach were often 
      uncorrelated, indicating that the results gleaned from a diet study can be 
      particularly sensitive to the applied methodologies. Our findings contribute to a 
      growing body of work indicating the importance of high-quality, aquatic habitats 
      for both consumers and their pollution-intolerant prey, while also demonstrating 
      how the application of multiple, laboratory-based techniques can provide insights 
      not offered by either technique alone.

TI  - Bioenergy landscapes drive trophic shifts in generalist ants.
PG  - 738-750
LID - 10.1111/1365-2656.13407 [doi]
AB  - Changes in trophic niche-the pathways through which an organism obtains energy 
      and nutrients-are a fundamental way in which organisms respond to environmental 
      conditions. But the capacity for species to alter their trophic niches in 
      response to global change, and the ways they do so when able, remain largely 
      unknown. Here we examine food webs in three long-term and large-scale experiments 
      to test how resource availability and nutritional requirements interact to 
      determine an organism's trophic niche in the context of one of the largest global 
      trends in land use-the rise in bioenergy production. We use carbon and nitrogen 
      stable isotope analyses to characterize arthropod food webs across three biofuel 
      crops representing a gradient in plant resource richness (corn monocultures, 
      fields dominated by native switchgrass and restored prairie), and to quantify 
      changes in the trophic niche of a widespread generalist ant species across 
      habitats. In doing so, we measure the effects of basal resource richness on food 
      chain length, niche breadth and trophic position. We frame our results in the 
      context of two hypotheses that explain variation in trophic niche-the niche 
      variation hypothesis which emphasizes the importance of resource diversity and 
      ecological opportunity, and the optimal diet hypothesis which emphasizes dietary 
      constraints and the availability of optimal resources. Increasing plant richness 
      lengthened food chains by 10%-20% compared to monocultures. Niche breadths of 
      generalist ants did not vary with resource richness, suggesting they were limited 
      by optimal diet requirements and constraints rather than by ecological 
      opportunity. The ants instead responded to changes in plant richness by shifting 
      their estimated trophic position. In resource-poor monocultures, the ants were 
      top predators, sharing a trophic position with predatory spiders. In 
      resource-rich environments, in contrast, the ants were omnivores, relying on a 
      mix of animal prey and plant-based resources. In addition to highlighting novel 
      ecosystem impacts of alternate bioenergy landscapes, our results suggest that 
      niche breadth and trophic diversification depend more on the presence of optimal 
      resources than on ecological opportunity alone.

AB  - Fatty acids (FAs) are used, often in combination with stable isotopes (SIs), as 
      chemical biomarkers to assess the contribution of different prey to the diet of 
      consumers and define food web structure and dynamics. Extraction of lipids is 
      traditionally carried out using methanol (MeOH) combined with chloroform or 
      dichloromethane, these latter being well-known environmental pollutant and 
      potential carcinogenic agents. Recently, extraction protocols based on methyl 
      tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and MeOH have been proposed as an alternative to 
      halogenated solvents in lipidomic studies. However, no specific investigation has 
      been performed to assess MTBE suitability in marine ecological studies including 
      FA analysis together with SI measurements. We used an analytical workflow for 
      qualitative and quantitative analysis of FAs and SIs in field samples of 
      phytoplankton, zooplankton and the scyphomedusa Pelagia noctiluca, applying MTBE 
      in comparison with chloroform- and dichloromethane-based protocols for total 
      lipid extraction. Our analysis suggested that MTBE is a reliable substitute for 
      lipid extraction in trophic ecology studies in marine planktonic organisms.

TI  - Stable isotopic evidence for land use patterns in the Middle Euphrates Valley, 
      Syria.
PG  - 861-874
LID - 10.1002/ajpa.23480 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios (δ(13) C and δ(15) N) were 
      used to reconstruct the history of subsistence strategies in the middle Euphrates 
      valley, NE Syria, in six temporal subsets dating from the Early Bronze Age (c. 
      2300 BCE) to the Modern period (19th/20th century CE). The study aims to 
      demonstrate that changes in political and social organization over time, for 
      which the archaeological record suggests different goals of land use and modes of 
      production, register through dietary patterns that are reflected in isotopic 
      data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 173 dentin samples were taken from human individuals 
      buried at three sites (Tell Ashara, Tell Masaikh and Gebel Mashtale) together 
      with 15 animal bone samples. Distribution of the δ(13) C and δ(15) N values in 
      collagen was interpreted in diachronic perspective, and with regard to lifetime 
      shifts between childhood and adolescence. RESULTS: Diachronically, isotope 
      signatures indicate a clear decrease in δ(15) N values accompanied by a small 
      shift in δ(13) C values between the Old Babylonian (c. 1800-1600 BCE) and the 
      Neo-Assyrian (c. 850-600 BCE) subsets. A major shift in δ(13) C values occurred 
      between the Early Islamic (c. 600-1200 CE) and Modern (c. 1800-1950) periods. 
      Ontogenetic changes only occur in a few individuals, but these suggest change of 
      residence between childhood and adolescence. DISCUSSION: The depletion in (15) N 
      from the Neo-Assyrian period onwards is best explained in terms of a shift from 
      intensive to extensive farming, triggered by the fall of regional city-states 
      after the Old Babylonian period and the formation of large supra-regional 
      polities in the Neo-Assyrian period and later. The enrichment in (13) C during 
      the Modern period was most likely the effect of more widely utilizing the dry 
      steppes, abundant in C(4) plants, as pasture.

TI  - Decreasing δ(13)C and δ(15)N values in four coastal species at different trophic 
      levels indicate a fundamental food-web shift in the southern North and Baltic 
      Seas between 1988 and 2016.

AB  - Marine ecosystems are exposed to increasing human pressures and climatic change 
      worldwide. It has therefore become essential to describe ecosystem statuses with 
      respect to multinational protection schemes, often necessitating long-term 
      monitoring programmes. Changes in the food-web structure, which can be monitored 
      via stable isotope measurements, represent an important descriptor of the status 
      of marine ecosystems. We investigated long-term changes (29 years) in isotopic 
      values (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) in four indicative organisms at different trophic 
      levels in the southern North and Baltic Seas: bladderwrack (Fucus vesiculosus), 
      blue mussel (Mytilus ssp.), eelpout (Zoarces viviparus), and herring gull (Larus 
      argentatus). Time series analyses using generalised additive models revealed 
      largely consistent declines in δ(13)C and δ(15)N throughout all trophic levels of 
      the coastal food web at all study sites, indicating a clear change in these 
      coastal regions from 1988 to 2016. There were no clear long-term patterns in egg 
      biometrics for herring gulls, except for a consistent increase in eggshell 
      thickness. The declines in stable isotope values were in line with the results of 
      previous long-term studies of single higher-trophic-level species, which 
      suggested that the noted changes were mainly caused by altered foraging patterns 
      of the studied species. The current results demonstrate that declines in δ(13)C 
      and δ(15)N have occurred throughout the whole food web, not just in particular 
      species. We discuss the possible reasons for the decrease in stable isotope 
      values, including decreasing eutrophication and an increase in terrestrial carbon 
      sources.

TI  - Rainforest-to-pasture conversion stimulates soil methanogenesis across the 
      Brazilian Amazon.
PG  - 658-672
LID - 10.1038/s41396-020-00804-x [doi]
AB  - The Amazon rainforest is a biodiversity hotspot and large terrestrial carbon sink 
      threatened by agricultural conversion. Rainforest-to-pasture conversion 
      stimulates the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The biotic methane 
      cycle is driven by microorganisms; therefore, this study focused on active 
      methane-cycling microorganisms and their functions across land-use types. We 
      collected intact soil cores from three land use types (primary rainforest, 
      pasture, and secondary rainforest) of two geographically distinct areas of the 
      Brazilian Amazon (Santarém, Pará and Ariquemes, Rondônia) and performed DNA 
      stable-isotope probing coupled with metagenomics to identify the active 
      methanotrophs and methanogens. At both locations, we observed a significant 
      change in the composition of the isotope-labeled methane-cycling microbial 
      community across land use types, specifically an increase in the abundance and 
      diversity of active methanogens in pastures. We conclude that a significant 
      increase in the abundance and activity of methanogens in pasture soils could 
      drive increased soil methane emissions. Furthermore, we found that secondary 
      rainforests had decreased methanogenic activity similar to primary rainforests, 
      and thus a potential to recover as methane sinks, making it conceivable for 
      forest restoration to offset greenhouse gas emissions in the tropics. These 
      findings are critical for informing land management practices and global tropical 
      rainforest conservation.

TI  - Using Stable Isotopes to Infer the Impacts of Habitat Change on the Diets and 
      Vertical Stratification of Frugivorous Bats in Madagascar.

AB  - Human-modified habitats are expanding rapidly; many tropical countries have 
      highly fragmented and degraded forests. Preserving biodiversity in these areas 
      involves protecting species-like frugivorous bats-that are important to forest 
      regeneration. Fruit bats provide critical ecosystem services including seed 
      dispersal, but studies of how their diets are affected by habitat change have 
      often been rather localized. This study used stable isotope analyses (δ15N and 
      δ13C measurement) to examine how two fruit bat species in Madagascar, Pteropus 
      rufus (n = 138) and Eidolon dupreanum (n = 52) are impacted by habitat change 
      across a large spatial scale. Limited data for Rousettus madagascariensis are 
      also presented. Our results indicated that the three species had broadly 
      overlapping diets. Differences in diet were nonetheless detectable between P. 
      rufus and E. dupreanum, and these diets shifted when they co-occurred, suggesting 
      resource partitioning across habitats and vertical strata within the canopy to 
      avoid competition. Changes in diet were correlated with a decrease in forest 
      cover, though at a larger spatial scale in P. rufus than in E. dupreanum. These 
      results suggest fruit bat species exhibit differing responses to habitat change, 
      highlight the threats fruit bats face from habitat change, and clarify the 
      spatial scales at which conservation efforts could be implemented.

AB  - To clarify the trophic relationship of important rock fishes, we analyzed trophic 
      niche of three typical rockfish species (Oplegnathus fasciatus, Sebastiscus 
      marmoratus and Conger myriaster) in the Zhongjieshan Islands in summer 2020, 
      based on the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope techniques. We calculated the 
      contributions of major carbon sources [macroalgae, phytoplankton, suspended 
      particulate organic matter (POM) and substrate organic matter (SOM)]. The results 
      showed that: 1) the δ(13)C values of the three species ranged from -21.44‰ to 
      -15.21‰, with an average value of (-16.85±1.12)‰, while the δ(15)N values ranged 
      from 8.32‰ to 10.96‰, with an average value of (9.69±0.66)‰. There were 
      significant differences in carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes among the three 
      species. 2) There was small niche overlap between O. fasciatus and S. marmoratus, 
      indicating that the interspecific competition was not intense. There was no 
      overlap between C. myriaster and the first two, indicating feeding 
      differentiation. 3) The total ecotone area, corrected core ecotone area, and food 
      source diversity of C. myriaster were the highest, indicating that it had a more 
      generalized diet and richer food sources. 4) With Mytilus coruscus as a baseline 
      organism, the trophic level of C. myriaster was the highest (3.38), followed by 
      S. marmoratus (3.09), and the trophic level of O. fasciatus was the smallest 
      (3.00). 5) Results of the stable isotope mixture model (SIAR) showed that POM was 
      the main carbon source of the three species, contributing 57.4%, 57.9%, and 92.0% 
      of the total, respectively. In addition, the contribution rate of SOM was also 
      high for O. fasciatus and S. marmoratus, which was 21.5% and 33.9%, respectively. 
      This study could provide basic information and reference for understanding 
      trophic structure and marine food web in Zhongjiashan Islands.

AB  - Despite a vast amount of literature has focused on trace element (TE) 
      contamination in Antarctica during the last decades, the assessment of the main 
      pathways driving TE transfer to the biota is still an overlooked issue. This 
      limits the ability to predict how variations in sea-ice dynamics and productivity 
      due to climate change will affect TE allocation in the food web. Here, food web 
      structure of Tethys Bay (Terra Nova Bay, Ross Sea, Antarctica) was first 
      characterised by analysing carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (δ(13)C, δ(15)N) 
      in organic matter sources (sediment and planktonic, benthic and sympagic primary 
      producers) and consumers (zooplankton, benthic invertebrates, fish and birds). 
      Diet and trophic position were also characterised using Bayesian mixing models. 
      Then, relationships between stable isotopes, diet and TEs (Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Hg, 
      Ni, Pb and V) were assessed in order to evaluate if and how horizontal (organic 
      matter pathways) and vertical (trophic position) food web features influence TE 
      transfer to the biota. Regressions between log[TE] and δ(13)C revealed that the 
      sympagic pathway drives accumulation of V in primary consumers and Cd and Hg in 
      secondary consumers, and that a coupled benthic/pelagic pathway drives Pb 
      transfer to all consumers. Regressions between log[TE] and δ(15)N showed that 
      only Hg biomagnifies across trophic levels, while all the others TEs showed a 
      biodilution pattern, consistent with patterns observed in temperate food webs. 
      Although the Cd behavior needs further investigations, the present findings 
      provide new insights about the role of basal sources in the transfer of TEs in 
      polar systems. This is especially important nowadays in light of the forecasted 
      trophic changes potentially resulting from climate change-induced modification of 
      sea-ice dynamics.

AB  - Dynamics of the Fukushima-derived radiocesium and distribution of the natural 
      stable isotope (133)Cs in Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) forest 
      ecosystems were studied during 2014-2016. For the experimental site in Yamakiya, 
      Fukushima Prefecture, we present the redistribution of radiocesium among 
      ecosystem compartments during the entire observation period, while the results 
      obtained at another two experimental site were used to demonstrate similarity of 
      the main trends in the Japanese forest ecosystems. Our observations at the 
      Yamakiya site revealed significant redistribution of radiocesium between the 
      ecosystem compartments during 2014-2016. During this same period radionuclide 
      inventories in the aboveground tree biomass were relatively stable, however, 
      radiocesium in forest litter decreased from 20 ± 11% of the total deposition in 
      2014 to 4.6 ± 2.7% in 2016. Radiocesium in the soil profile accumulated in the 
      5-cm topsoil layers. In 2016, more than 80% of the total radionuclide deposition 
      in the ecosystem resided in the 5-cm topsoil layer. The radiocesium distribution 
      between the aboveground biomass compartments at Yamakiya during 2014-2016 was 
      gradually approaching a quasi-equilibrium distribution with stable cesium. Strong 
      correlations of radioactive and stable cesium isotope concentrations in all 
      compartments of the ecosystem have not been reached yet. However, in some 
      compartments the correlation is already strong. An increase of radiocesium 
      concentrations in young foliage in 2016, compared to 2015, and an increase in 
      2015-2016 of the (137)Cs/(133)Cs concentration ratio in the biomass compartments 
      with strong correlations indicate an increase in root uptake of radiocesium from 
      the soil profile. Mass balance of the radionuclide inventories, and accounting 
      for radiocesium fluxes in litterfall, throughfall and stemflow, enabled a rough 
      estimate of the annual radiocesium root uptake flux as 2 ± 1% of the total 
      inventory in the ecosystem.

AB  - Deployment of artificial reefs (ARs) has become popular technique to create new 
      hard-bottom habitats, increase biodiversity and richness for fisheries. We 
      compared the faunal community structure and food web structure associated with 
      before and after fishing moratorium between ARs and non-ARs in Wanshan Island, 
      Pearl River Estuary using stable isotope techniques. Community composition showed 
      higher differences between ARs and non-ARs. The range of δ(13)C and δ(15)N of 
      different functional groups can distinguish the pelagic and benthic trophic 
      pathways of the food web in reef-or-not area before and after fishing moratorium. 
      The isotopic niches of entire faunal, as well as individual functional groups, 
      overlapped less between ARs and non-ARs in Wanshan Island, which makes the 
      isotopic functional indices non-equivalent. The total convex hull area (TA) of 
      ARs was larger than that of non-ARs, indicating that nutrient pathways of ARs 
      were more diverse. Overall, however, these results suggest that trophic structure 
      was convergence between ARs and non-ARs, and differences before and after fishing 
      moratorium, possibly due to seasonal differences. Finally, it was shown that the 
      construction of ARs had a weak effect on the restoration of fishery resources in 
      this area, which might be related to lack of further management, or even similar 
      community composition to non-ARs areas.

AB  - For many years after the discovery of the two stable isotopes of boron 
      ((10)B,(11)B) in 1920 they were not used as tracers in the soil-plant system due 
      to analytical constraints. However, with the advent of inductively coupled plasma 
      mass spectrometry in the early 1980s, it became possible to measure precisely the 
      natural variations of the B isotopes in biological systems. Nevertheless, up to 
      the present time there is very little information in the literature on δ (11)B 
      variations in soils, plants, fertilizers and foodstuffs. Therefore, information 
      on the potential of δ (11)B as a tracer of B dynamics in natural- and 
      agro-ecosystems remains limited. The relative abundance of the boron isotope (δ 
      (11)B) in soils, plants and nutrient sources, and applications of variations in 
      the natural abundance of (11)B as a tracer of anthropogenic sources of nitrate 
      contamination of water and the provenance of agricultural products are reviewed.

      ponds, assessed using stable isotope and gut content analyses.

AB  - The analysis of food web structures has increased the understanding of the 
      dynamics of organisms belonging to different trophic levels. In this study, the 
      diet of two native species, Glossogobius callidus and Gilchristella aestuaria, 
      was assessed in the presence of two non-native species, Oreochromis mossambicus 
      and Gambusia affinis, in irrigation ponds, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. 
      The proportion of dietary items consumed and assimilated by the four fish species 
      were inferred from gut contents and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis. 
      Stable isotope analysis revealed that both G. affinis and O. mossambicus had a 
      larger isotopic niche size than G. callidus and G. aestuaria. Although G. 
      callidus fed on benthic resources and G. aestuaria fed on phytoplankton, gut 
      content analysis showed that G. callidus, O. mossambicus and G. affinis fed 
      predominantly on benthic resources, whereas G. aestuaria fed mainly on plankton 
      resources. Considerable niche overlap corroborates the view that resource 
      competition is a major factor shaping the composition of the four fish species. 
      This study highlighted the low diversity of the food web within the Sundays River 
      Valley irrigation ponds, where food items are shared by all the small-bodied 
      fishes.

TI  - Comparison of Pollution Levels, Biomagnification Capacity, and Risk Assessments

AB  - Seawater and fish were collected from nearshore (Pearl River Estuarine, PRE) and 
      offshore (middle of the South China Sea, MSCS) regions of the South China Sea 
      (SCS) to determine the heavy metals (HMs) pollution status and biomagnification 
      characteristics. Results show that Cu in PRE seawater was moderately 
      contaminated. Overall pollution risk of seawater were PRE (3.32) > MSCS (0.56), 
      whereas that of fish was MSCS (0.88) > PRE (0.42). δ(13)C and δ(15)N exhibited 
      distinguished characteristics for PRE and MSCS fish, indicating the diverse 
      energy sources, nitrogen sources, and food web structures of nearshore and 
      offshore regions. Cu was biomagnified whereas Pb and Ni were biodiluted in 
      offshore fish. Hg presented significant biomagnification in both of nearshore and 
      offshore fish. Finally, the target hazard quotient of Hg (1.41) in MSCS fish 
      exceeded the standard limit, which was posed by high Hg concentration and 
      consumption rate of offshore fish.

AB  - The microbial food web (MFW) is a material and energy source in lake water 
      ecosystems. Although it is crucial to determine its structure and function for 
      water ecological health, MFW changes during lake melt period have not been well 
      studied. In this study, the MFW was divided into three categories by analyzing 
      its structure and trophic transfer efficiency using hierarchical C/N stable 
      isotopes and eDNA sequencing techniques, including the detrital food web (DFC, 15 
      %), classical grazing food web (CFC, 60 %), and mixed trophic food web (MFC, 25 
      %). The trophic structure and type of MFW in ice-melting lakes are always in the 
      process of succession and adaptation, which is in a relatively low trophic 
      transfer efficiency stage under stable conditions (i.e. CFC), whereas the input 
      of exogenous debris and organic pollutants may lead to an increase in MFW trophic 
      transfer efficiency (i.e. MFC, DFC). The trophic transfer efficiency from the 
      previous trophic level to protozoa and micrometazoa was 16.32 % and 20.77 % in 
      DFC and 10.20 % and 29.43 % in MFC, respectively. Both are obviously higher than 
      those of the CFC (11.69 % and 9.45 %, respectively). In terms of trophic 
      structure, the community interaction and trophic cascade effect of DFC and MFC 
      were enhanced but easily changed with environmental factors. In contrast, the 
      core species and cascading effects of the CFC were clearer, and the MFW structure 
      was relatively stable. Overall, this study reveals that the explosive increase in 
      MFW trophic transfer efficiency induced by exogenous input during the lake melt 
      period may subsequently lead to the destabilization of the microbial community 
      structure and cause potential ecological risks. These are manifested in the 
      absence of ecological trophic processes, the decrease in trophic structure 
      complexity and stability, and the weakening of microecology self-adaptive 
      regulation ability.

AB  - Assessing organic matter fluxes and species interactions in food webs is of main 
      interest to understand the ecological functioning in bays and estuaries 
      characterised by a wide diversity of primary producers and consumers. Demersal 
      fish and cephalopod assemblages were studied across a network of 24 shallow 
      subtidal stations in the bay of Saint-Brieuc for their diversity, stable isotope 
      compositions and stomach contents. The community was composed of 21 taxa, eight 
      species accounting for 94.4% of the total abundance. Three different assemblages 
      were identified along bathymetric gradient and spatial patterns in fish dredging. 
      Marine POM and SOM were the most likely bases of food webs regarding δ(13)C range 
      displayed by fish and cephalopod without differences among assemblages. Amphipoda 
      was the main prey item in stomachs leading to significant diet overlaps among 
      fish species, with some variations in additional items. Sepia officinalis was 
      characterised by a singular diet and very low dietary overlap with other species. 
      Contrasted stable isotope values and niche overlaps among species were evidenced 
      in the δ(13)C/δ(15)N space. Callionymus lyra and Buglossidium luteum, 
      characterised by the widest isotopic niches, encompassed those of other species, 
      except the singular (13)C-depleted Spondyliosoma cantharus. Coupling taxonomic 
      assemblages, stomach contents and stable isotope analyses help disentangling the 
      resources uses and evidencing trophic pathways. Contrasts in fish and cephalopod 
      demersal assemblages occurring at different depths not necessarily imply 
      differences in the trophic resources uses in such complex shallow coastal 
      ecosystems under anthropogenic influences.

AB  - Despite the major importance of soil biota in nutrient and energy fluxes, 
      interactions in soil food webs are poorly understood. Here we provide an overview 
      of recent advances in uncovering the trophic structure of soil food webs using 
      natural variations in stable isotope ratios. We discuss approaches of 
      application, normalization and interpretation of stable isotope ratios along with 
      methodological pitfalls. Analysis of published data from temperate forest 
      ecosystems is used to outline emerging concepts and perspectives in soil food web 
      research. In contrast to aboveground and aquatic food webs, trophic fractionation 
      at the basal level of detrital food webs is large for carbon and small for 
      nitrogen stable isotopes. Virtually all soil animals are enriched in (13) C as 
      compared to plant litter. This 'detrital shift' likely reflects preferential 
      uptake of (13) C-enriched microbial biomass and underlines the importance of 
      microorganisms, in contrast to dead plant material, as a major food resource for 
      the soil animal community. Soil organic matter is enriched in (15) N and (13) C 
      relative to leaf litter. Decomposers inhabiting mineral soil layers therefore 
      might be enriched in (15) N resulting in overlap in isotope ratios between 
      soil-dwelling detritivores and litter-dwelling predators. By contrast, (13) C 
      content varies little between detritivores in upper litter and in mineral soil, 
      suggesting that they rely on similar basal resources, i.e. little decomposed 
      organic matter. Comparing vertical isotope gradients in animals and in basal 
      resources can be a valuable tool to assess trophic interactions and dynamics of 
      organic matter in soil. As indicated by stable isotope composition, direct 
      feeding on living plant material as well as on mycorrhizal fungi is likely rare 
      among soil invertebrates. Plant carbon is taken up predominantly by saprotrophic 
      microorganisms and channelled to higher trophic levels of the soil food web. 
      However, feeding on photoautotrophic microorganisms and non-vascular plants may 
      play an important role in fuelling soil food webs. The trophic niche of most 
      high-rank animal taxa spans at least two trophic levels, implying the use of a 
      wide range of resources. Therefore, to identify trophic species and links in food 
      webs, low-rank taxonomic identification is required. Despite overlap in feeding 
      strategies, stable isotope composition of the high-rank taxonomic groups reflects 
      differences in trophic level and in the use of basal resources. Different 
      taxonomic groups of predators and decomposers are likely linked to different 
      pools of organic matter in soil, suggesting different functional roles and 
      indicating that trophic niches in soil animal communities are phylogenetically 
      structured. During last two decades studies using stable isotope analysis have 
      elucidated the trophic structure of soil communities, clarified basal food 
      resources of the soil food web and revealed links between above- and belowground 
      ecosystem compartments. Extending the use of stable isotope analysis to a wider 
      range of soil-dwelling organisms, including microfauna, and a larger array of 
      ecosystems provides the perspective of a comprehensive understanding of the 
      structure and functioning of soil food webs.

AB  - Polar cod (Boreogadus saida) is an important trophic link within Arctic marine 
      food webs and is likely to experience diet shifts in response to climate change. 
      One important tool for assessing organism diet is bulk stable isotope analysis. 
      However, key parameters necessary for interpreting the temporal context of stable 
      isotope values are lacking, especially for Arctic species. This study provides 
      the first experimental determination of isotopic turnover (as half-life) and 
      trophic discrimination factors (TDFs) of both δ(13) C and δ(15) N in adult polar 
      cod muscle. Using a diet enriched in both (13) C and (15) N, we measured isotopic 
      turnover times of 61 and 49 days for δ(13) C and δ(15) N, respectively, with 
      metabolism accounting for >94% of the total turnover. These half-life estimates 
      are valid for adult polar cod (>3 years) experiencing little somatic growth. We 
      measured TDFs in our control of 2.6‰ and 3.9‰ for δ(13) C and δ(15) N, 
      respectively, and we conclude that applying the commonly used TDF of ~1‰ for 
      δ(13) C for adult polar cod may lead to misrepresentation of dietary carbon 
      source, while the use of 3.8‰ for δ(15) N is appropriate. Based on these results, 
      we recommend that studies investigating seasonal shifts in the diet of adult 
      polar cod sample at temporal intervals of at least 60 days to account for 
      isotopic turnover in polar cod muscle. Although isotopic equilibrium was reached 
      by the fish in this study, it was at substantially lower isotope values than the 
      diet. Additionally, the use of highly enriched algae in the experimental feed 
      caused very high variability in diet isotope values which precluded accurate 
      calculation of TDFs from the enriched fish. As a result of the challenges faced 
      in this study, we discourage the use of highly enriched diets for similar 
      experiments and provide recommendations to guide the design of future isotopic 
      turnover experiments.

TI  - Trophic niche segregation allows range-extending coral reef fishes to co-exist 
      with temperate species under climate change.
PG  - 721-733
LID - 10.1111/gcb.14898 [doi]
AB  - Changing climate is forcing many terrestrial and marine species to extend their 
      ranges poleward to stay within the bounds of their thermal tolerances. However, 
      when such species enter higher latitude ecosystems, they engage in novel 
      interactions with local species, such as altered predator-prey dynamics and 
      competition for food. Here, we evaluate the trophic overlap between 
      range-extending and local fish species along the east coast of temperate 
      Australia, a hotspot for ocean warming and species range extensions. Stable 
      isotope ratios (δ(15) N and δ(13) C) of muscle tissue and stomach content 
      analysis were used to quantify overlap of trophic niche space between vagrant 
      tropical and local temperate fish communities along a 730 km (6°) latitudinal 
      gradient. Our study shows that in recipient temperate ecosystems, sympatric 
      tropical and temperate species do not overlap significantly in their diet-even 
      though they forage on broadly similar prey groups-and are therefore unlikely to 
      compete for trophic niche space. The tropical and temperate species we studied, 
      which are commonly found in shallow-water coastal environments, exhibited 
      moderately broad niche breadths and local-scale dietary plasticity, indicating 
      trophic generalism. We posit that because these species are generalists, they can 
      co-exist under current climate change, facilitating the existence of novel 
      community structures.

AB  - Tropical oceans host a high diversity of species, including large marine 
      consumers. In these oligotrophic ecosystems, oceanic islands often favour the 
      aggregation of species and biomass as they provide feeding opportunities related 
      to the mechanisms of island mass effect. As such, the waters surrounding La 
      Reunion (Southwest Indian Ocean) host seabirds, large pelagic teleosts, 
      elasmobranchs, delphinids and sea turtles. Isotopic niche partitioning and 
      comparison of trophic levels among these species (n = 21) were investigated using 
      stable carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) isotope analysis. Overall, δ(13)C 
      values were highly variable among taxa, indicating that the species exploit 
      multiple foraging habitats along a coast-open ocean gradient. Overlap in δ(15)N 
      values was limited, except for teleost species, the two species of sea turtles 
      and two species of delphinids, the Indo-pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops 
      aduncus) and the Spinner dolphin (Stellena longirostris). Stable isotope analyses 
      of samples collected over a 9-years period on different tissues with different 
      integration times provide a consistent picture of the structure of the community 
      of large marine vertebrates species around La Reunion and highlight the 
      underlying mechanisms to limit the competition between species. The wide range of 
      isotopic values confirms that large marine vertebrates have different trophic 
      roles in coastal marine food webs around this oceanic island, which limits their 
      potential of competitive interactions for resources.

AB  - Higher frequencies of summer droughts are predicted to change soil conditions in 
      the future affecting soil fauna communities and their biotic interactions. In 
      agroecosystems drought effects on soil biota may be modulated by different 
      management practices that alter the availability of different food resources. 
      Recent studies on the effect of drought on soil microarthropods focused on 
      measures of abundance and diversity. We here additionally investigated shifts in 
      trophic niches of Collembola and Oribatida as indicated by stable isotope 
      analysis ((13)C and (15)N). We simulated short-term summer drought by excluding 
      65% of the ambient precipitation in conventionally and organically managed winter 
      wheat fields on the DOK trial in Switzerland. Stable isotope values suggest that 
      plant litter and root exudates were the most important resources for Collembola 
      (Isotoma caerulea, Isotomurus maculatus and Orchesella villosa) and older plant 
      material and microorganisms for Oribatida (Scheloribates laevigatus and 
      Tectocepheus sarekensis). Drought treatment and farming systems did not affect 
      abundances of the studied species. However, isotope values of some species 
      increased in organically managed fields indicating a higher proportion of 
      microorganisms in their diet. Trophic niche size, a measure of both isotope 
      values combined, decreased with drought and under organic farming in some species 
      presumably due to favored use of plants as basal resource instead of algae and 
      microorganisms. Overall, our results suggest that the flexible usage of resources 
      may buffer effects of drought and management practices on the abundance of 
      microarthropods in agricultural systems.

AB  - Discarding practices have become a source of concern for the perennation of 
      marine resources, prompting efforts of discard reduction around the globe. 
      However, little is known about the fate of discards in marine environments. 
      Discarding may provide food for various marine consumers, potentially affecting 
      food web structure and stability. Yet, quantifying reliance upon discards is 
      difficult because identity and frequency of discards may change according to 
      multiple factors, and most previously used diet assessment techniques do not 
      allow to assume consistency of feeding strategies over time. One currently 
      untested hypothesis is that significant contribution of discards over time should 
      reflect in increased trophic level (TL) of marine fauna, particularly in low TL 
      consumers. Here, we explored this hypothesis by modeling the TL and assimilated 
      diet of consumers living in fishing grounds subject to important discarding 
      activity using stable isotope analysis. We found indications that benthic 
      invertebrates and Chondrichthyes may depict a higher than expected TL, while 
      other fish tend to depict similar to lower TL compared to global averages from 
      the literature. Based on prior knowledge of discard consumption in the same area, 
      stable isotope mixing models congruently revealed that discards may represent 
      substantial portions of the assimilated diet of most benthic invertebrate 
      macrofauna, cephalopods and Chondrichthyes. We highlight limitations and 
      challenges of currently used diet assessment techniques to study discard 
      consumption and stress that understanding their reintegration in marine food webs 
      is crucial in the context of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management and to 
      better understand the functioning of marine ecosystems subject to fishing.

AB  - Magnetic-nanoparticle-mediated isolation coupled with stable-isotope probing 
      (MMI-SIP) is a cultivation-independent higher-resolution approach for isolating 
      active degraders in their natural habitats. However, it addresses the community 
      level and cannot directly link the microbial identities, phenotypes, and in situ 
      functions of the active degraders at the single-cell level within complex 
      microbial communities. Here, we used (13)C-labeled phenanthrene as the target and 
      developed a new method coupling MMI-SIP and Raman-activated cell sorting (RACS), 
      namely, MMI-SIP-RACS, to identify the active phenanthrene-degrading bacterial 
      cells from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-contaminated wastewater. 
      MMI-SIP-RACS significantly enriched the active phenanthrene degraders and 
      successfully isolated the representative single cells. Amplicon sequencing 
      analysis by SIP, (13)C shift of the single cell in Raman spectra, and the 16S 
      rRNA gene from single cell sequencing via RACS confirmed that Novosphingobium was 
      the active phenanthrene degrader. Additionally, MMI-SIP-RACS reconstructed the 
      phenanthrene metabolic pathway and genes of Novosphingobium, including two novel 
      genes encoding phenanthrene dioxygenase and naphthalene dioxygenase. Our findings 
      suggested that MMI-SIP-RACS is a powerful method to efficiently and precisely 
      isolate active PAH degraders from complex microbial communities and directly link 
      their identities to functions at the single-cell level.

AB  - Birds are excellent vectors of allochthonous matter and energy due to their high 
      mobility, with more intense flow when waterbirds congregate in breeding colonies, 
      feeding in surrounding aquatic and terrestrial areas, and promoting nutritional 
      pulses to nutrient-poor environments. In southern Brazil, a swamp forest on an 
      estuarine island is used by waterbirds for breeding, providing an opportunity to 
      investigate the potential effects of transport of matter between nutrient-rich 
      environments. Soil, plants, invertebrates, and blood from terrestrial birds were 
      collected and stable isotopes compared to similar organisms in a control site 
      without heronries. Values of δ(15)N and δ(13)C from waterbirds were higher in the 
      colony in comparison to the control site (spatial effect). The enrichment of 
      (15)N and (13)C provided during the active colony period persisted after the 
      breeding period, especially for δ(15)N, which was higher in all compartments 
      (temporal effect). Moreover, the enrichment of (15)N occurred along the entire 
      trophic chain (vertical effect) in the colony environment, including different 
      guilds of invertebrates and land birds. The enrichment in (13)C seems to lose 
      strength and was mostly explained by factors such as trophic guild rather than 
      site, especially in birds. Bayesian mixture models with terrestrial vs. estuarine 
      endpoints demonstrated that all organisms from both colony and control 
      environments had assimilated estuarine matter. Finally, detritivorous 
      invertebrates showed greater assimilation when compared to other guilds. This 
      study demonstrates that adjacent nutrient-rich environments, such as palustrine 
      forests and estuaries, are nutritionally enriched in several dimensions from 
      nearby autochthonous subsidies that are maintained throughout the year.

AB  - Forest management can alter the mobilization of mercury (Hg) into headwater 
      streams and its conversion to methylmercury (MeHg), the form that bioaccumulates 
      in aquatic biota and biomagnifies through food webs. As headwater streams are 
      important sources of organic materials and nutrients to larger systems, this 
      connectivity may also increase MeHg in downstream biota through direct or 
      indirect effects of forestry on water quality or food web structure. In this 
      study, we collected water, seston, food sources (biofilm, leaves, organic 
      matter), five macroinvertebrate taxa and fish (slimy sculpin; Cottus cognata) at 
      6 sites representing different stream orders (1-5) within three river basins with 
      different total disturbances from forestry (both harvesting and silviculture). 
      Methylmercury levels were highest in water and some food sources from the basin 
      with moderate disturbance (greater clearcutting but less silviculture). Water, 
      leaves, stoneflies and fish increased in MeHg or total Hg along the river 
      continuum in the least disturbed basin, and there were some dissipative effects 
      of forest management on these spatial patterns. Trophic level (δ(15)N) was a 
      significant predictor of MeHg (and total Hg in fish) within food webs across all 
      18 sites, and biomagnification slopes were significantly lower in the basin with 
      moderate total disturbance but not different in the other two basins. The 
      elevated MeHg in lower trophic levels but its reduced trophic transfer in the 
      basin with moderate disturbance was likely due to greater inputs of sediments and 
      of dissolved organic carbon that is more humic, as these factors are known to 
      both increase transport of Hg to streams and its uptake in primary producers but 
      to also decrease MeHg bioaccumulation in consumers. Overall, these results 
      suggest that the type of disturbance from forestry affects MeHg bioaccumulation 
      and trophic transfer in stream food webs and some longitudinal patterns along a 
      river continuum.

AB  - In this study, we elucidated the impacts of allochthonous organic matter (OM) and 
      nutrients (N and P) inputs coming from agriculture and shrimp aquaculture 
      activities on food web structure in a subtropical coastal lagoon located on the 
      central-east of the Gulf of California. This coastal lagoon is highly influenced 
      by OM and nutrients inputs by a large agriculture district and aquaculture 
      development center in Mexico. We also selected a second coastal lagoon, without 
      direct OM and nutrients inputs, considered as a 'pristine' ecosystem. We 
      evaluated the quantity of OM, N and P in both ecosystems and reconstructed the 
      food webs using isotopic tools of C and N from the base to top. We collected and 
      analyzed autochthonous and allochthonous OM, and organisms including primary 
      producers, and primary to tertiary consumers. Overall, specimens of the same 
      species and/or functional groups showed higher δ(15)N values in the ecosystem 
      receiving agriculture and shrimp aquaculture effluents than the pristine. Food 
      webs were composed of four and five trophic levels, where fish and birds occupied 
      the top-predator levels. Seasonal increases in OM and N and P quantities in 
      lagoons affected by anthropogenic activities produced high δ(15)N values in 
      primary producers and consumers.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems are negatively impacted by various pollutants, from 
      agricultural, urban and industrial wastewater, with metals being one of the 
      largest concerns. Moreover, freshwater ecosystems are often affected by alien 
      species introductions that can modify habitats and trophic relationships. 
      Accordingly, the threat posed by metals interacts with those by alien species, 
      since the latter can accumulate and transfer these substances across the food web 
      to higher trophic levels. How metals transfer within such communities is little 
      studied. We analysed the concentration of 14 metals/metalloids (Al, As, Cd, Co, 
      Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, Zn, hereafter 'metal(s)') of eight fish and 
      three crustacean species co-existing in the Arno River (Central Italy), most of 
      which were alien. To assess the pathway of contaminants within the community, we 
      coupled metal analysis with carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis derived 
      from the same specimens. Crustaceans showed higher metal concentration than fish, 
      except for Cd, Hg and Se that were higher in fish. We found evidence of trophic 
      transfer for six metals (Cd, Cr, Hg, Mg, Se, Zn). Additionally, ontogenetic 
      differences and differences among various fish tissues (muscle, liver, and gills) 
      were found in metals concentration. Considerable biomagnification along the 
      trophic chain was found for Hg, while other metals were found to biodilute. Using 
      stable isotopes and Hg as a third diet tracer, we refined the estimations of 
      consumed preys in the diet previously reconstructed with stable isotope mixing 
      models. Alien species reach high biomass and can both survive to and accumulate 
      high pollutants concentrations, potentially posing a risk for their predators and 
      humans. A combined effect of environmental filtering and increased competition 
      may potentially contribute to the disappearance of native species with lower 
      tolerances.

AB  - Human land use is of growing concern for island ecosystems. Besides direct 
      impacts on biodiversity, land uses can alter the functioning and structure of 
      ecosystems. Central to this are impacts on food webs. The release of additional 
      nutrients from human origin, habitat homogenization, or environmental filtering 
      due to human land use can change the diet of individual consumer species (i.e., 
      their trophic niches) and the distribution and overlap of trophic niches within a 
      food web. However, it remains largely unclear whether the effects on food web 
      properties vary between the different and predominant human land uses present on 
      islands. Here, we investigated the impact of two dominant human land uses on 
      small oceanic islands (i.e., urban and tourism development) and tested if and how 
      different land uses on islands affect food web structure. To disentangle human 
      land uses, we investigated islands, which were either privately owned by a 
      tourist facility (i.e., exclusively tourism land use) or experienced urban 
      development from the local population (i.e., urban land use), or remained 
      uninhabited, serving as reference sites free of direct land use. Using stable 
      isotope analysis, we show that isotope signature, trophic (isotopic) niches, and 
      overall food web properties of the investigated island invertebrate communities 
      were significantly changed under both land use regimes. While trophic diversity 
      was reduced and trophic niche widths increased under tourism land use, the 
      investigated food webs showed reduced trophic diversity at the food web base and 
      a more uneven trophic niche distribution under urban land use. In summary, these 
      findings show that different human land uses can have contrasting impacts on 
      oceanic island food webs. As oceanic islands experience rapidly growing human 
      land conversion, our results indicate that they may also face increasing yet 
      unpredictable long-term changes in food web dynamics.

TI  - Coupling stable isotopes to evaluate sources and transformations of nitrate in 
      groundwater and inflowing rivers around the Caohai karst wetland, Southwest 
      China.

AB  - Nitrate is one of the most common pollutants in aquatic ecosystems, particularly 
      in highly vulnerable karst aquifers. In Caohai Lake, an important karst wetland 
      in southwestern China, karst surface water and groundwater are important recharge 
      water sources, and nitrates flow into the wetland along with the surface water 
      and groundwater, degrading the wetland water quality. Therefore, identifying the 
      sources of nitrate in the surface water and groundwater in the Caohai catchment 
      is of great significance to the protection of the wetland water environment. In 
      this study, the nitrate concentrations, hydrochemistry and multiple stable 
      isotope ratios (δ(18)O-H(2)O, δD-H(2)O, δ(15)N-NO(3)(-) and δ(18)O-NO(3)(-)) were 
      used to identify the sources and fate of the NO(3)(-) in the groundwater and 
      inflowing rivers around the Caohai wetland. The results showed that the NO(3)(-) 
      concentrations in the groundwater samples from the southern side exceeded the WHO 
      limit during the wet season, while other samples did not exceed the limit. The 
      mean concentrations of NO(3)(-) in groundwater were higher than those in the 
      inflowing river water, and NO(3)(-) concentrations decreased in the order of wet 
      season>dry season>normal season in the groundwater and inflowing rivers. The 
      hydrochemistry and multiple isotope ratios suggest that the nitrate 
      transformation was dominated by nitrification processes, while denitrification 
      had an influence on the transformation of NO(3)(-) (as evidenced by isotopes) in 
      groundwater during the dry season. According to the analyses based on a stable 
      isotope analysis in R (SIAR), sewage and manure were the main sources of NO(3)(-) 
      in the groundwater, while sewage, manure and chemical fertilizer were the major 
      sources of NO(3)(-) in the inflowing river water; therefore, the scientific use 
      of farmland fertilizers and the treatment of domestic sewage should be 
      strengthened to safeguard groundwater quality and control the NO(3)(-) 
      concentrations in rivers.

AB  - Prior to the introduction of wheat and barley from Central Asia during the 
      Neolithic period, northern Chinese agricultural groups subsisted heavily on 
      millet. Despite being the focus of many decades of intensive interest and 
      research, the exact route(s), date(s), and mechanisms of the spread and adoption 
      of wheat and barley into the existing well-established millet-based diet in 
      northern China are still debated. As the majority of the important introduced 
      crops are C3 plants, while the indigenous millet is C4, archaeologists can 
      effectively identify the consumption of any introduced crops using stable carbon 
      isotope analysis. Here we examine published stable isotope and dental caries data 
      of human skeletal remains from 77 archaeological sites across northern and 
      northwestern China. These sites date between 9000 to 1750 BP, encompassing the 
      period from the beginning of agriculture to wheat's emergence as a staple crop in 
      northern China. The aim of this study is to evaluate the implications of the 
      spread and adoption of these crops in ancient China. Detailed analysis of human 
      bone collagen δ13C values reveals an almost concurrent shift from a C4-based to a 
      mixed C3/ C4- based subsistence economy across all regions at around 4500-4000 
      BP. This coincided with a global climatic event, Holocene Event 3 at 4200 BP, 
      suggesting that the sudden change in subsistence economy across northern and 
      northwestern China was likely related to climate change. Moreover, the 
      substantially increased prevalence of dental caries from pre-to post-4000 BP 
      indicates an increase in the consumption of cariogenic cereals during the later 
      period. The results from this study have significant implications for 
      understanding how the adoption of a staple crop can be indicative of large-scale 
      environmental and socio-political changes in a region.

TI  - Morphological and dietary responses of chipmunks to a century of climate change.
PG  - 3233-52
LID - 10.1111/gcb.13216 [doi]
AB  - Predicting how individual taxa will respond to climatic change is challenging, in 
      part because the impacts of environmental conditions can vary markedly, even 
      among closely related species. Studies of chipmunks (Tamias spp.) in Yosemite 
      National Park provide an important opportunity to explore the reasons for this 
      variation in response. While the alpine chipmunk (T. alpinus) has undergone a 
      significant elevational range contraction over the past century, the congeneric 
      and partially sympatric lodgepole chipmunk (T. speciosus) has not experienced an 
      elevational range shift during this period. As a first step toward identifying 
      the factors underlying this difference in response, we examined evidence for 
      dietary changes and changes in cranial morphology in these species over the past 
      century. Stable isotope analyses of fur samples from modern and historical museum 
      specimens of these species collected at the same localities indicated that 
      signatures of dietary change were more pronounced in T. alpinus, although diet 
      breadth did not differ consistently between the study species. Morphometric 
      analyses of crania from these specimens revealed significant changes in cranial 
      shape for T. alpinus, with less pronounced changes in shape for T. speciosus; 
      evidence of selection on skull morphology was detected for T. alpinus, but not 
      for T. speciosus. These results are consistent with growing evidence that 
      T. alpinus is generally more responsive to environmental change than 
      T. speciosus, but emphasize the complex and often geographically variable nature 
      of such responses. Accordingly, future studies that make use of the taxonomically 
      and spatially integrative approach employed here may prove particularly 
      informative regarding relationships between environmental conditions, range 
      changes, and patterns of phenotypic variation.

TI  - Spiders in rice-paddy ecosystems shift from aquatic to terrestrial prey and use 
      carbon pools of different origin.
PG  - 801-812
LID - 10.1007/s00442-020-04601-3 [doi]
AB  - Spiders are important bio-control agents of rice insect pests such as plant- and 
      leafhoppers. To investigate temporal changes in spider prey and variations in 
      prey due to landscape structure around rice fields, carbon and nitrogen stable 
      isotopes of rice field arthropods were analysed over three consecutive sampling 
      dates during the rice cropping season. Initial isotope composition of gnats and 
      midges emerging from submersed rice fields indicates a larval algae diet, while 
      later values suggest a switch to rice-derived carbon. Initial δ(13)C values of 
      plant- and leafhoppers were higher in fields of rice-heterogeneous landscapes, 
      indicating migration from source populations feeding on C4 grasses into rice 
      fields; later, their δ(13)C values approached those of rice. Isotope values of 
      web-building and cursorial spiders in the earliest samples indicate aquatic gnat 
      and midge prey. The later shift toward terrestrial herbivore prey was more 
      pronounced for small than for larger species and in rice paddies near permanent 
      vegetation, indicating use of prey from the surrounding landscape. The results 
      suggest that rice field spiders are supported by three different carbon pools: 
      (1) aquatic carbon originating from algae and (2) legacy carbon from previous 
      growing cycles, both incorporated via between-season predation on gnats and 
      midges, and (3) carbon from the current rice season incorporated via herbivore 
      prey. In conclusion, fostering aquatic midge and gnat larvae, e.g. via mulching, 
      and integrating rice fields into rice-heterogeneous landscapes likely strengthens 
      biological control of pest species in rice paddies by supporting high populations 
      of spiders between cropping seasons.

TI  - The pelagic food web of the Western Adriatic Sea: a focus on the role of small 
      pelagics.
PG  - 14554

AB  - The Adriatic Sea is one of the largest areas of occurrence of shared small 
      pelagic stocks and the most fished area of the Mediterranean Sea, which is in 
      turn one of the most exploited basins of the world. The variations in the stable 
      isotope contents (δ(15)N and δ(13)C) were determined for three small pelagic 
      fishes (i.e., Engraulis encrasicolus, Sardina pilchardus, and Sprattus sprattus, 
      respectively known as anchovies, sardines and sprats) collected across the 
      western side of the basin. Our data allowed to determine the width and features 
      of their trophic niches, to assess potential overlap or resource partitioning 
      among them, and likely anticipate species adaptation to future climate change 
      scenarios. Moreover, variations in stable isotope contents were correlated to 
      both resource availability (i.e., mesozooplankton) and environmental variables. 
      The high productivity and in turn the high resource availability of the basin, 
      especially in the northern part, resulted in favor of the resource partitioning 
      that occurs in each sub-area of the Adriatic Sea among the three species. 
      Medium-sized specimens of the three species mostly fed on small zooplankton, 
      while adult sprats relied on large copepods and those of sardines and anchovies 
      also consumed large portion of phytoplankton, confirming the high trophic 
      plasticity of these two dominants small pelagic species. However, considering 
      that anchovies have the greatest degree of trophic diversity compared with the 
      other two species, they could be the most adapted to changing feeding conditions. 
      The increase in sea temperatures that are reducing primary production and in turn 
      zooplankton abundances, coupled with even more frequent extreme meteorologic 
      events could exacerbate the competition for trophic resources among pelagic 
      mesopredators, and could lead to more notable stocks' fluctuations and 
      unpredictable wasp-waist effects.

TI  - Stable isotopes demonstrate seasonally stable benthic-pelagic coupling as newly 
      fixed nutrients are rapidly transferred through food chains in an estuarine fish 
      community.
LID - 10.1111/jfb.15005 [doi]
AB  - Seasonal differences in the availability of resources potentially result in the 
      food web architecture also varying through time. Stable isotope analyses are a 
      logistically simple but powerful tool for inferring trophic interactions and food 
      web structure, but relatively few studies quantify seasonal variations in the 
      food web structure or nutrient flux across multiple trophic levels. We determined 
      the temporal dynamics in stable isotope compositions (carbon, nitrogen and 
      sulphur) of a fish community from a highly seasonal, temperate estuary sampled 
      monthly over a full annual cycle. Sulphur isotope values in fish tissues 
      discriminated among consumers exploiting pelagic and benthic resources but showed 
      no seasonal variation. This implied limited change in the relative consumption of 
      pelagic and benthic resources by the fish community over the study period despite 
      major seasonal changes in phytoplankton biomass. Conversely, carbon and nitrogen 
      isotope values exhibited seasonality marked by the commencement of the spring 
      phytoplankton bloom and peak chlorophyll concentration, with δ(13) C values 
      following expected trends in phytoplankton growth physiology and variation in 
      δ(15) N values coinciding with changes in major nitrogen sources to plankton 
      between nitrate and ammonium. Isotope shifts in fish muscle were detected within 
      2 weeks of the peak spring phytoplankton bloom, suggesting a rapid trophic 
      transfer of carbon and nitrogen along food chains within the estuarine food web 
      during periods of high production. Therefore we caution against the assumption 
      that temporal averaging effectively dampens isotopic variability in tissues of 
      higher trophic-level animals in highly dynamic ecosystems, such as temperate 
      estuaries. This work highlights how stable isotope analyses can be combined with 
      environmental data to gain a broader understanding of ecosystem functioning, 
      while emphasising the need for temporally appropriate sampling in stable 
      isotope-based studies.

AB  - Understanding and connecting the impact of anthropogenic activities on mangrove 
      food webs is a research challenge. Has research on the subject been able to find 
      answers using stable isotopes? The present opinion paper analyzed the utility of 
      stable isotopes in tracing the impact of anthropogenic activities on mangrove 
      food webs and if the research questions raised could be answered using these 
      chemical markers. Representative research papers (16) focused on the use of 
      stable isotopes (δ(13)C, δ(15)N, δ(34)S, δ(2)H, δD,206Pb/207Pb, and 208Pb/207Pb) 
      to evaluate the effect of anthropogenic activities (Sewage discharge, timber 
      harvesting-deforestation, metallurgical activities, hydrological disruption, 
      aquaculture ponds, and urban development) on mangrove food webs were selected. 
      Each article included at least one group of consumers (invertebrate or fish). 
      Publications only focused on water quality or primary producers were not 
      included. Most studies managed to determine the effect of the anthropogenic 
      activities on the food web's stable isotope values. Based on the above, we 
      concluded that these markers are an effective tool to determine affectation 
      patterns on the structure and function of mangrove food webs. The results 
      obtained herein facilitate the correct management of mangroves and their derived 
      resources.

AB  - A consequence of over 400 years of human exploitation of Galápagos tortoises 
      (Chelonoidis niger ssp.) is the extinction of several subspecies and the 
      decimation of others. As humans captured, killed, and/or removed tortoises for 
      food, oil, museums, and zoos, they also colonized the archipelago resulting in 
      the introduction of invasive plants, animals, and manipulated landscapes for 
      farming, ranching, and infrastructure. Given current conservation and 
      revitalization efforts for tortoises and their habitats, here we investigate 
      nineteenth and twentieth century Galápagos tortoise dietary ecology using museum 
      and archaeological specimens coupled with analysis of carbon (δ(13)C(collagen) 
      and δ(13)C(apatite)), nitrogen (δ(15)N), hydrogen (δD) and oxygen 
      (δ(18)O(apatite)) stable isotopes and radiocarbon dating. We identify that 
      Galápagos tortoise diets vary between and within islands over time, and that 
      long-term anthropogenic impacts influenced change in tortoise stable isotope 
      ecology by using 57 individual tortoises from 10 different subspecies collected 
      between 1833 and 1967-a 134-year period. On lower elevation islands, which are 
      often hotter and drier, tortoises tend to consume more C(4) vegetation (cacti and 
      grasses). Our research suggests human exploitation of tortoises and anthropogenic 
      impacts on vegetation contributed to the extinction of the Floreana Island 
      tortoise (C. n. niger) in the 1850s.

AB  - To evaluate the impact of bottom aquaculture on benthic ecosystems, 
      characteristics of benthic food web were studied using stable isotope techniques 
      during four seasons in a Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) bottom aquaculture 
      area in a semi-enclosed bay, China. Results showed that although nitrogen stable 
      isotope values of food sources (particulate organic matter and phytoplankton) had 
      significant seasonal differences, there were no significant seasonal changes for 
      benthic food web structure. Manila clam bottom aquaculture can enhance the 
      secondary productivity and improve the basic trophic pathways by providing 
      bio-deposits. Besides particulate organic matter and phytoplankton, Manila clam 
      could feed on self-generated feces with high nitrogen stable isotope values, and 
      benthic micro- and macroalga with high carbon stable isotope values. Secondary 
      productivity of the stations with a high degree of aquaculture was higher than 
      that of stations with a low degree. Bivalve bottom culture may have a positive 
      impact on benthic ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Stable isotopes in elephant hair document migration patterns and diet changes.
PG  - 371-3
AB  - We use chronologies of stable isotopes measured from elephant (Loxodonta 
      africana) hair to determine migration patterns and seasonal diet changes in 
      elephants in and near Samburu National Reserve in northern Kenya. Stable carbon 
      isotopes record diet changes, principally enabling differentiation between browse 
      and tropical grasses, which use the C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways, 
      respectively; stable nitrogen isotopes record regional patterns related to 
      aridity, offering insight into localized ranging behavior. Isotopically 
      identified range shifts were corroborated by global positioning system radio 
      tracking data of the studied individuals. Comparison of the stable isotope record 
      in the hair of one migrant individual with that of a resident population shows 
      important differences in feeding and ranging behavior over time. Our analysis 
      indicates that differences are the result of excursions into mesic environments 
      coupled with intermittent crop raiding by the migrant individual. Variation in 
      diet, quantified by using stable isotopes, can offer insight into diet-related 
      wildlife behavior.

AB  - A responsible approach to marine stock enhancement is an effective approach to 
      restore fishery resources. While the release strategy of target species has been 
      well investigated, the impacts on local ecological equilibrium and habitat 
      qualities have only been poorly considered. In the present study, we evaluated 
      how the macro-benthic food web in Daya Bay was affected by purple sea urchin 
      (Heliocidaris crassispina (Agassiz, 1864) stock enhancement using stable isotope 
      analyses (δ(13)C and δ(15)N). Our results indicated that the distribution of 
      local species and trophic diversity were influenced to a certain degree by 
      release of purple sea urchins and changes in the feeding habit of the urchins 
      were observed in line with food abundance, which seasonally varied. When food is 
      abundant, the main food source of sea urchins was microphytobenthos and no 
      significant differences were observed among sites; significant differences in the 
      diet of purple sea urchins were detected when food is less abundant. These 
      results suggested that optimization of the release strategy should include 
      information on seasonal productivity of local recipient sites, food web structure 
      and feeding habits of released species. Such information is essential for 
      building a responsible release approach to maximize production enhancement.

LID - e9999
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess whether ecological inferences from 
      isotopic functional indices (IFIs) are impacted by changes in isotopic baselines 
      in aquatic food webs. We used sudden CO(2)-outgassing and associated shifts in 
      DIC-δ (13)C brought by waterfalls as an excellent natural experimental set-up to 
      quantify impacts of changes in algal isotopic baselines on ecological inferences 
      from IFIs. METHODS: Carbon (δ (13)C) and nitrogen (δ (15)N) stable isotopic 
      ratios of invertebrate communities sharing similar structure were measured at 
      above- and below-waterfall sampling sites from five rivers and streams in 
      Southern Quebec (Canada). For each sampled invertebrate community, the six 
      Laymans IFIs were then calculated in the δ -space (δ (13)C vs. δ (15)N). RESULTS: 
      As expected, isotopic functional richness indices, measuring the overall extent 
      of community trophic space, were strongly sensitive to changes in isotopic 
      baselines unlike other IFIs. Indeed, other IFIs were calculated based on the 
      distribution of species within δ-space and were not strongly impacted by changes 
      in the vertical or horizontal distribution of specimens in the δ-space. Our 
      results highlighted that IFIs exhibited different sensitivities to changes in 
      isotopic baselines, leading to potential misinterpretations of IFIs in river 
      studies where isotopic baselines generally show high temporal and spatial 
      variabilities. The identification of isotopic baselines and their associated 
      variability, and the use of independent trophic tracers to identify the actual 
      energy pathways through food webs must be a prerequisite to IFIs-based studies to 
      strengthen the reliability of ecological inferences of food web structural 
      properties.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change will impact nutrient cycles, primary production, and 
      ecosystem structure in the world's oceans, although considerable uncertainty 
      exists regarding the magnitude and spatial variability of these changes. 
      Understanding how regional-scale ocean conditions control nutrient availability 
      and ultimately nutrient assimilation into food webs will inform how marine 
      resources will change in response to climate. To evaluate how ocean conditions 
      influence the assimilation of nitrogen and carbon into coastal marine food webs, 
      we applied a novel dimension reduction analysis to a century of newly acquired 
      molecular isotope data derived from historic harbor seal bone specimens. By 
      measuring bulk δ(13) C and δ(15) N values of source amino acids of these top 
      predators from 1928 to 2014, we derive indices of primary production and nitrogen 
      resources that are assimilated into food webs. We determined coastal food webs 
      responded to climate regimes, coastal upwelling, and freshwater discharge, yet 
      the strength of responses to individual drivers varied across the northeast 
      Pacific. Indices of primary production and nitrogen availability in the Gulf of 
      Alaska were dependent on regional climate indices (i.e., North Pacific Gyre 
      Oscillation) and upwelling. In contrast, the coastal Washington and Salish Sea 
      food webs were associated with local indices of freshwater discharge. For some 
      regions (eastern Bering Sea, northern Gulf of Alaska) food web-assimilated 
      production was coupled with nitrogen sources; however, other regions demonstrated 
      no production-nitrogen coupling (Salish Sea). Temporal patterns of environmental 
      indices and isotopic data from Washington state varied about the long-term mean 
      with no directional trend. Data from the Gulf of Alaska, however, showed below 
      average harbor seal δ(13) C values and above average ocean conditions since 1975, 
      indicating a change in primary production in recent decades. Altogether, these 
      findings demonstrate stable isotope data can provide useful indices of nitrogen 
      resources and phytoplankton dynamics specific to what is assimilated by food 
      webs.

AB  - Environmental pollution and biological invasions are key drivers of biodiversity 
      change. However, the effects of invasion and pollution on food webs remain 
      largely unexplored. Here, we used stable isotopes to examine the effects of 
      common carp Cyprinus carpio and pollution on trophic dynamics in six small 
      reservoirs. Our results revealed that the trophic niche widths of invertebrates, 
      vertebrates, and invasive carp did not significantly differ among reservoirs with 
      different pollution statuses. However, we found low niche conservatism among 
      reservoirs, suggesting that while niche width may remain consistent, there is a 
      shift in the position of the niches in isotopic space under both pollution and 
      invasion scenarios. Niche conservatism among reservoirs was generally higher in 
      invertebrates, but this was also regardless of reservoir condition (i.e. presence 
      or absence of pollution and invasion). These results suggest that invasion by 
      species coupled with organic pollution may cause subtle yet differing effects on 
      components of a food web (basal end-members, invertebrates and vertebrates). Our 
      findings provide a baseline measure of the potential in the development of 
      detection and response strategies for carp invasions and organic pollution.

AB  - Floodplains represent critical nursery habitats for a variety of fish species due 
      to their highly productive food webs, yet few tools exist to quantify the extent 
      to which these habitats contribute to ecosystem-level production. Here we 
      conducted a large-scale field experiment to characterize differences in food web 
      composition and stable isotopes (δ¹³C, δ¹⁵N, δ³⁴S) for salmon rearing on a large 
      floodplain and adjacent river in the Central Valley, California, USA. The study 
      covered variable hydrologic conditions including flooding (1999, 2017), average 
      (2016), and drought (2012-2015). In addition, we determined incorporation rates 
      and tissue fractionation between prey and muscle from fish held in enclosed 
      locations (experimental fields, cages) at weekly intervals. Finally, we measured 
      δ³⁴S in otoliths to test if these archival biominerals could be used to 
      reconstruct floodplain use. Floodplain-reared salmon had a different diet 
      composition and lower δ13C and δ³⁴S (δ¹³C = -33.02±2.66‰, δ³⁴S = -3.47±2.28‰; 
      mean±1SD) compared to fish in the adjacent river (δ¹³C = -28.37±1.84‰, δ³⁴S = 
      +2.23±2.25‰). These isotopic differences between habitats persisted across years 
      of extreme droughts and floods. Despite the different diet composition, δ¹⁵N 
      values from prey items on the floodplain (δ¹⁵N = 7.19±1.22‰) and river (δ¹⁵N = 
      7.25±1.46‰) were similar, suggesting similar trophic levels. The food web 
      differences in δ13C and δ³⁴S between habitats were also reflected in salmon 
      muscle tissue, reaching equilibrium between 24-30 days (2014, δ¹³C = 
      -30.74±0.73‰, δ³⁴S = -4.6±0.68‰; 2016, δ¹³C = -34.74 ±0.49‰, δ³⁴S = -5.18±0.46‰). 
      δ³⁴S measured in sequential growth bands in otoliths recorded a weekly 
      time-series of shifting diet inputs, with the outermost layers recording time 
      spent on the floodplain (δ³⁴S = -5.60±0.16‰) and river (δ³⁴S = 3.73±0.98‰). Our 
      results suggest that δ¹³C and δ³⁴S can be used to differentiate floodplain and 
      river rearing habitats used by native fishes, such as Chinook Salmon, across 
      different hydrologic conditions and tissues. Together these stable isotope 
      analyses provide a toolset to quantify the role of floodplains as fish habitats.

AB  - In the Ross Sea, biodiversity organisation is strongly influenced by sea-ice 
      cover, which is characterised by marked spatio-temporal variations. Expected 
      changes in seasonal sea-ice dynamics will be reflected in food web architecture, 
      providing a unique opportunity to study effects of climate change. Based on 
      individual stable isotope analyses and the high taxonomic resolution of sampled 
      specimens, we described benthic food webs in contrasting conditions of seasonal 
      sea-ice persistence (early vs. late sea-ice break up) in medium-depth waters in 
      Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea). The architecture of biodiversity was reshaped by the 
      pulsed input of sympagic food sources following sea-ice break up, with food web 
      simplification, decreased intraguild predation, potential disturbance propagation 
      and increased vulnerability to biodiversity loss. Following our approach, it was 
      possible to describe in unprecedented detail the complex structure of biodiverse 
      communities, emphasising the role of sympagic inputs, regulated by sea-ice 
      dynamics, in structuring Antarctic medium-depth benthic food webs.

AB  - Soil-vegetation-atmosphere continuum (SPAC) is one of the important research 
      objects in the field of terrestrial hydrology, ecology and global change. The 
      process of water and carbon cycling, and their coupling mechanism are frontier 
      issues. With characteristics of tracing, integration and indication, stable 
      isotope techniques contribute to the estimation of the relationship between 
      carbon sequestration and water consumption in ecosystems. In this review, based 
      on a brief introduction of stable isotope principles and techniques, the 
      applications of stable isotope techniques to water and carbon exchange in SPAC 
      using optical stable isotope techniques were mainly explained, including: 
      partitioning of net carbon exchange into photosynthesis and respiration; 
      partitioning of evapotranspiration into transpiration and evaporation; coupling 
      of water and carbon cycle at the ecosystem scale. Advanced techniques and methods 
      provided long-term and high frequency measurements for isotope signals at the 
      ecosystem scale, but the issues about the precision and accuracy for 
      measurements, partitioning of ecosystem respiration, adaptability for models 
      under non-steady state, scaling up, coupling mechanism of water and carbon 
      cycles, were challenging. The main existing research findings, limitations and 
      future research prospects were discussed, which might help new research and 
      technology development in the field of stable isotope ecology.

AB  - Coastal aquaculture expansion resulted in mangrove area loss and ecosystem 
      degradation in the past decades, mainly in tropical Asia. Despite increasing 
      environmental concerns regarding nutrient and organic matter-rich effluents, 
      little is known on the effects on adjacent estuarine and coastal food webs. To 
      assess the impact and fate of anthropogenic nitrogen released from aquaculture 
      facilities, we studied water quality and nitrogen (N) flow across an estuarine 
      food web in an estuary in Hainan, China, using nitrogen stable isotopes (δ(15)N). 
      We found higher δ(15)N values of ammonium, nitrate and suspended matter in the 
      pond-covered inner estuary than further upstream, suggesting a strong influence 
      of untreated pond effluents, which had a high δ(15)N (ammonium: ~16‰, nitrate: 
      ~7‰, suspended matter: ~8‰). Fish and benthic invertebrates of the inner estuary 
      had a higher δ(15)N than consumers further upstream and in similar 
      aquaculture-free estuaries elsewhere, most likely due to direct or indirect 
      uptake of (15)N-enriched aquaculture effluents by phytoplankton and benthic 
      algae. A major part of the artisanal catches from the estuary consists of 
      small-size fish which is used as feed in the local aquaculture. Thus, estuarine 
      fish incorporating aquaculture-effluent based food web signals are harvested and 
      recycled as feed in aquaculture facilities, whose effluents sustain this local 
      food web. The δ(15)N being at the high end of the global range on all trophic 
      levels indicates an anthropogenic nitrogen loop in which some portion of the 
      reactive nitrogen initially introduced into aquaculture ponds is continuously 
      recycled and affects the estuarine food web. This recycling also indicates a 
      shortcut in the otherwise inefficient nitrogen sink function of estuaries. 
      Therefore, in areas with large-scale coastal aquaculture like in China and SE 
      Asia the effect of reactive nitrogen from aquaculture sources on the performance 
      of coastal ecosystems may be larger than previously thought.

TI  - Humpback whale diets respond to variance in ocean climate and ecosystem 
      conditions in the California Current.

AB  - Large, migratory predators are often cited as sentinel species for ecosystem 
      processes and climate-related changes, but their utility as indicators is 
      dependent upon an understanding of their response to environmental variability. 
      Documentation of the links between climate variability, ecosystem change and 
      predator dynamics is absent for most top predators. Identifying species that may 
      be useful indicators and elucidating these mechanistic links provides insight 
      into current ecological dynamics and may inform predictions of future ecosystem 
      responses to climatic change. We examine humpback whale response to environmental 
      variability through stable isotope analysis of diet over a dynamic 20-year period 
      (1993-2012) in the California Current System (CCS). Humpback whale diets captured 
      two major shifts in oceanographic and ecological conditions in the CCS. Isotopic 
      signatures reflect a diet dominated by krill during periods characterized by 
      positive phases of the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), cool sea surface 
      temperature (SST), strong upwelling and high krill biomass. In contrast, humpback 
      whale diets are dominated by schooling fish when the NPGO is negative, SST is 
      warmer, seasonal upwelling is delayed and anchovy and sardine populations display 
      increased biomass and range expansion. These findings demonstrate that humpback 
      whales trophically respond to ecosystem shifts, and as a result, their foraging 
      behavior is a synoptic indicator of oceanographic and ecological conditions 
      across the CCS. Multi-decadal examination of these sentinel species thus provides 
      insight into biological consequences of interannual climate fluctuations, 
      fundamental to advancing ecosystem predictions related to global climate change.

TI  - Reciprocal subsidies between freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems structure 
      consumer resource dynamics.
PG  - 1173-82
AB  - Cross-ecosystem movements of material and energy, particularly reciprocal 
      resource fluxes across the freshwater-land interface, have received major 
      attention. Freshwater ecosystems may receive higher amounts of subsidies (i.e., 
      resources produced outside the focal ecosystem) than terrestrial ecosystems, 
      potentially leading to increased secondary production in freshwaters. Here we 
      used a meta-analytic approach to quantify the magnitude and direction of subsidy 
      inputs across the freshwater-land interface and to determine subsequent responses 
      in recipient animals. Terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems differed in the 
      magnitude of subsidies they received, with aquatic ecosystems generally receiving 
      higher subsidies than terrestrial ecosystems. Surprisingly, and despite the large 
      discrepancy in magnitude, the contribution of these subsidies to animal carbon 
      inferred from stable isotope composition did not differ between freshwater and 
      terrestrial ecosystems, likely due to the differences in subsidy quality. The 
      contribution of allochthonous subsidies was highest to primary consumers and 
      predators, suggesting that bottom-up and top-down effects may be affected 
      considerably by the input of allochthonous resources. Future work on subsidies 
      will profit from a food web dynamic approach including indirect trophic 
      interactions and propagating effects.

TI  - Bottom-up when it is not top-down: Predators and plants control biomass of 
      grassland arthropods.
PG  - 1286-1294
LID - 10.1111/1365-2656.13191 [doi]
AB  - We investigate where bottom-up and top-down control regulates ecological 
      communities as a mechanism linking ecological gradients to the geography of 
      consumer abundance and biomass. We use standardized surveys of 54 North American 
      grasslands to test alternate hypotheses predicting 100-fold shifts in the biomass 
      of four common grassland arthropod taxa-Auchenorrhyncha, sucking herbivores, 
      Acrididae, chewing herbivores, Tettigoniidae, omnivores, and Araneae, predators. 
      Bottom-up models predict that consumer biomass tracks plant quantity (e.g. 
      productivity and standing biomass) and quality (nutrient content) and that 
      ectotherm access to food increases with temperature. Each of the focal trophic 
      groups responded differently to these drivers: the biomass of sucking herbivores 
      and omnivores increased with plant biomass; that of chewing herbivores tracked 
      plant quality; and predator biomass did not depend on plant quality, plant 
      quantity or temperature. The Exploitation Ecosystem Hypothesis is a top-down 
      hypothesis that predicts a shift from resource limitation of herbivores when 
      plant production is low, to predator limitation when plant production is high. In 
      grasslands where spider biomass was low, herbivore biomass increased with plant 
      biomass, whereas bottom-up structuring was not evident when spiders were 
      abundant. Furthermore, neither predator biomass nor trophic position (via stable 
      isotope analysis) increased with plant biomass, suggesting predators themselves 
      are top-down limited. Stable isotope analysis revealed that trophic position of 
      the chewing herbivore and omnivore increased significantly with plant biomass, 
      suggesting these groups increased scavenging and meat consumption in grasslands 
      with higher carbohydrate availability. Taken together, our snapshot sampling 
      documents gradients of food web structure across 54 grasslands, consistent with 
      multiple hypotheses of bottom-up and top-down regulation.

AB  - Species interactions form food webs, impacting community structure and, 
      potentially, ecological dynamics. It is likely that global climatic perturbations 
      that occur over long periods of time have a significant influence on species 
      interaction patterns. Here, we integrate stable isotope analysis and network 
      theory to reconstruct patterns of trophic interactions for six independent 
      mammalian communities that inhabited mammoth steppe environments spanning western 
      Europe to eastern Alaska (Beringia) during the Late Pleistocene. We use a 
      Bayesian mixing model to quantify the contribution of prey to the diets of local 
      predators, and assess how the structure of trophic interactions changed across 
      space and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), a global climatic event that severely 
      impacted mammoth steppe communities. We find that large felids had diets that 
      were more constrained than those of co-occurring predators, and largely 
      influenced by an increase in Rangifer abundance after the LGM. Moreover, the 
      structural organization of Beringian and European communities strongly differed: 
      compared with Europe, species interactions in Beringian communities before--and 
      possibly after--the LGM were highly modular. We suggest that this difference in 
      modularity may have been driven by the geographical insularity of Beringian 
      communities.

TI  - Warm vegetarians? Heat waves and diet shifts in tadpoles.
PG  - 2964-2974

AB  - Temperature can play an important role in determining the feeding preferences of 
      ectotherms. In light of the warmer temperatures arising with the current climatic 
      changes, omnivorous ectotherms may perform diet shifts toward higher herbivory to 
      optimize energetic intake. Such diet shifts may also occur during heat waves, 
      which are projected to become more frequent, intense, and longer lasting in the 
      future. Here, we investigated how heat waves of different duration affect feeding 
      preferences in omnivorous anuran tadpoles and how these choices affect larval 
      life history. In laboratory experiments, we fed tadpoles of three species on 
      animal, plant, or mixed diet and exposed them to short heat waves (similar to the 
      heat waves these species experience currently) or long heat waves (predicted to 
      increase under climate change). We estimated the dietary choices of tadpoles fed 
      on the mixed diet using stable isotopes and recorded tadpole survival and growth, 
      larval period, and mass at metamorphosis. Tadpole feeding preferences were 
      associated with their thermal background, with herbivory increasing with breeding 
      temperature in nature. Patterns in survival, growth, and development generally 
      support decreased efficiency of carnivorous diets and increased efficiency or 
      higher relative quality of herbivorous diets at higher temperatures. All three 
      species increased herbivory in at least one of the heat wave treatments, but the 
      responses varied among species. Diet shifts toward higher herbivory were 
      maladaptive in one species, but beneficial in the other two. Higher herbivory in 
      omnivorous ectotherms under warmer temperatures may impact species differently 
      and further contribute to changes in the structure and function of freshwater 
      environments.

TI  - In Situ Discrimination and Cultivation of Active Degraders in Soils by 
      Genome-Directed Cultivation Assisted by SIP-Raman-Activated Cell Sorting.
PG  - 17087-17098
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.3c04247 [doi]
AB  - The identification and in situ cultivation of functional yet uncultivable 
      microorganisms are important to confirm inferences regarding their ecological 
      functions. Here, we developed a new method that couples Raman-activated cell 
      sorting (RACS), stable-isotope probing (SIP), and genome-directed cultivation 
      (GDC)─namely, RACS-SIP-GDC─to identify, sort, and cultivate the active toluene 
      degraders from a complex microbial community in petroleum-contaminated soil. 
      Using SIP, we successfully identified the active toluene degrader Pigmentiphaga, 
      the single cells of which were subsequently sorted and isolated by RACS. We 
      further successfully assembled the genome of Pigmentiphaga based on the 
      metagenomic sequencing of (13)C-DNA and genomic sequencing of sorted cells, which 
      was confirmed by gyrB gene comparison and average nucleotide identity 
      determination. Additionally, the genotypes and phenotypes of this degrader were 
      directly linked at the single-cell level, and its complete toluene metabolic 
      pathways in petroleum-contaminated soil were reconstructed. Based on its unique 
      metabolic properties uncovered by genome sequencing, we modified the traditional 
      cultivation medium with antibiotics, amino acids, carbon sources, and growth 
      factors (e.g., vitamins and metals), achieving the successful cultivation of 
      RACS-sorted active degrader Pigmentiphaga sp. Our results implied that 
      RACS-SIP-GDC is a state-of-the-art approach for the precise identification, 
      targeted isolation, and cultivation of functional microbes from complex 
      communities in natural habitats. RACS-SIP-GDC can be used to explore specific and 
      targeted organic-pollution-degrading microorganisms at the single-cell level and 
      provide new insights into their biodegradation mechanisms.

      ecosystem.

AB  - The bioaccumulation and biomagnification of Hg and Se were investigated in 
      Sarasota Bay, Florida, USA, to characterize the Hg exposure risks to wild 
      bottlenose dolphins in the bay. Concentrations of total mercury (THg), 
      monomethylmercury (MMHg), and total selenium (TSe) were monitored in the bay, the 
      latter of which might reduce Hg toxicity. The food web structure and dolphins' 
      trophic level-specific consumption rates were evaluated using stable isotope 
      ratios of carbon (δ(13) C) and nitrogen (δ(15) N). Regressions developed for Hg 
      biomagnification in the food chain were log10 CTHg (nanograms per gram) =0.27 × 
      δ(15) N (‰) - 0.42, R(2)  =0.87, for THg and log10 CMMHg  =0.33 × δ(15) N (‰) - 
      1.0, R(2)  =0.93, for MMHg. Unlike Hg, nearly constant TSe concentrations were 
      observed at 248 ± 179 ng g(-1) in the food web, and the TSe-to-THg molar ratio 
      was predicted by log10 (CTSe /CTHg ) = -0.10 × δ(15) N (‰) +2.8, R(2)  =0.60. The 
      THg-uptake rates of Sarasota bottlenose dolphins are estimated to vary between 
      2.1 and 4.9 µg kg(-1) d(-1) ; however, the estimated TSe-uptake rates (15.1 
      µg kg(-1) d(-1) ) were higher than those for THg, and the Hg-exposure risks of 
      the Sarasota Bay resident bottlenose dolphins are considered to be low. 
      Approaches employed in the present study can be extended to other environments to 
      characterize Hg contamination in aquatic systems and Hg exposure risks in top 
      predators.

TI  - Complex Life Histories Alter Patterns of Mercury Exposure and Accumulation in a 
      Pond-Breeding Amphibian.
PG  - 4133-4142
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.2c04896 [doi]
AB  - Quantifying how contaminants change across life cycles of species that undergo 
      metamorphosis is critical to assessing organismal risk, particularly for 
      consumers. Pond-breeding amphibians can dominate aquatic animal biomass as larvae 
      and are terrestrial prey as juveniles and adults. Thus, amphibians can be vectors 
      of mercury exposure in both aquatic and terrestrial food webs. However, it is 
      still unclear how mercury concentrations are affected by exogenous (e.g., habitat 
      or diet) vs endogenous factors (e.g., catabolism during hibernation) as 
      amphibians undergo large diet shifts and periods of fasting during ontogeny. We 
      measured total mercury (THg), methylmercury (MeHg), and isotopic compositions (δ 
      (13)C, δ(15)N) in boreal chorus frogs (Pseudacris maculata) across five life 
      stages in two Colorado (USA) metapopulations. We found large differences in 
      concentrations and percent MeHg (of THg) among life stages. Frog MeHg 
      concentrations peaked during metamorphosis and hibernation coinciding with the 
      most energetically demanding life cycle stages. Indeed, life history transitions 
      involving periods of fasting coupled with high metabolic demands led to large 
      increases in mercury concentrations. The endogenous processes of metamorphosis 
      and hibernation resulted in MeHg bioamplification, thus decoupling it from the 
      light isotopic proxies of diet and trophic position. These step changes are not 
      often considered in conventional expectations of how MeHg concentrations within 
      organisms are assessed.

TI  - Trophic Structure and Biomagnification of Total Mercury in Ray Species Within a 
      Benthic Food Web.
PG  - 321-329
LID - 10.1007/s00244-019-00632-x [doi]
AB  - Stable isotopes of C (δ(13)C) and N (δ(15)N) were used to explore the trophic 
      structure and evaluate mercury (Hg) biomagnification in the food web of muscle of 
      three commercially important ray species from the Pacific coast of Baja 
      California Sur (PCBCS): the shovelnose guitarfish (Pseudobatos productus), banded 
      guitarfish (Zapteryx exasperata), and bat ray (Myliobatis californica). The food 
      web of these ray species predominately consisted of zooplankton, three species of 
      fish, and five species of invertebrates. Mean δ(15)N values in all species ranged 
      from 10.54 ± 0.18‰ in zooplankton to 17.84 ± 0.81‰ in the shovelnose guitarfish. 
      Mean δ(13)C values ranged from - 22.05 ± 0.75‰ in the red crab to - 15.93 ± 0.78‰ 
      in the bat ray. Mean total Hg concentration ([THg]) in all species ranged from 
      0.0009 ± 0.0002 mg kg(-1) ww in zooplankton to 0.24 ± 0.19 mg kg(-1) ww in the 
      banded guitarfish. The food web magnification factor was 6.38 and significantly 
      greater than 1.0. The present study describes [THg] biomagnification in the 
      benthic food web of three ray species of the PCBCS. This provides an important 
      baseline knowledge of the biomagnification dynamics and pathways of Hg in this 
      environment for these multiple interacting species.

TI  - Ontogenetic resource use and trophic dynamics of endangered juvenile Tachypleus

PG  - 908-928

AB  - Horseshoe crabs, the most well-known example of "living fossils", are iconic and 
      ecologically important macroinvertebrates in coastal and estuarine ecosystems. 
      Their blood is a crucial resource for manufacturing Limulus or Tachypleus 
      amebocyte lysate to detect bacterial endotoxins or fungal contamination in drug 
      and medical devices. An enhanced understanding of their ecological roles and 
      trophic interactions in the food webs is fundamental to facilitate resource 
      management for the declining populations in Asia. Foraging information of the 
      Asian species, however, is mainly derived from preliminary, scattered reports 
      from a limited number of study locations. In this study, resource utilization, 
      trophic niche dynamics, and trophic interaction of the juvenile tri-spine 
      horseshoe crab, Tachypleus tridentatus (instars 1-12, approximately 0.5-8 years 
      old) across ontogeny was assessed in diversified nursery habitats along the 
      northern Beibu Gulf, China, using carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes. Our 
      results suggest that: (i) T. tridentatus are ecological generalists given the 
      vast range of carbon isotopic values and trophic niche width estimates exhibited 
      between multiple instar groups; (ii) juvenile T. tridentatus across most habitat 
      types predominantly assimilated energy from a variety of basal production sources 
      in the food web, but primarily depended on sedimentary organic matter and 
      seagrass resource pools; (iii) ontogenetic shifts in juvenile dietary proportions 
      were evident, with decreased reliance on sedimentary organic matter, coupled with 
      increased reliance on benthic macroinvertebrate grazers, detritivores, and 
      omnivores with age; and (iv) nearly all juvenile instars occupied similar trophic 
      positions in the food web with slight shifts in trophic position present with 
      increasing size. Our findings indicate that resource availability and ontogenetic 
      diet shifts strongly influence horseshoe crab trophic dynamics, and age should be 
      accounted when formulating habitat conservation measures based on resource use 
      for Asian horseshoe crabs.

AB  - We used complementary stable isotope (SIA) and stomach content (SCA) analyses to 
      investigate feeding relationships among species of the nektobenthic communities 
      and the potential ecological effects of the bottom trawling of a coastal 
      ecosystem in northeastern Brazil. Carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) compositions 
      were determined for five basal sources and 28 consumers, from zooplankton to 
      shrimp and fish species. Fishes and basal sources showed a broad range of δ15N 
      (fishes: 6.49-14.94‰; sources: 2.58-6.79‰) and δ13C values (fishes: -23.86 to 
      -13.71‰; sources: -24.32 to -13.53‰), while shrimps and crabs exhibited similar 
      nitrogen and carbon ratios. Six trophic consumer groups were determined among 
      zooplankton, crustaceans and fishes by SIA, with trophic pathways associated 
      mostly with benthic sources. SCA results indicated a preference for benthic 
      invertebrates, mainly worms, crabs and shrimps, as prey for the fish fauna, 
      highlighting their importance in the food web. In overall, differences between 
      SCA and the SIA approaches were observed, except for groups composed mainly for 
      shrimps and some species of high δ15N values, mostly piscivorous and 
      zoobenthivores. Given the absence of regulation for bottom trawling activities in 
      the area, the cumulative effects of trawling on population parameters, species 
      composition, potentially decreasing the abundance of benthic preys (e.g., 
      shrimps, worms and crabs) may lead to changes in the trophic structure 
      potentially affect the food web and the sustainability of the fishery.

AB  - Persistent and bioaccumulative contaminants often reach concentrations that 
      threaten aquatic life by causing alterations in organism behavior and 
      development, disruption of biological processes, reproductive abnormalities, and 
      mortality. The objectives of this research were to determine the aquatic food web 
      structure and trophic transfer and accumulation of contaminants within a riverine 
      ecosystem and identify potential stressors to the health of an imperiled fish, 
      the robust redhorse (Moxostoma robustum) and other species of conservation 
      concern in a large Atlantic Slope (USA) river. Trophic position was determined 
      for food web taxa by stable isotope analyses of representative producers, 
      consumers, and organic matter of the Yadkin-Pee Dee River of North Carolina and 
      South Carolina. Contaminant analyses were performed on water, sediment, organic 
      matter, and aquatic biota to assess the prevalence and accumulation of 
      polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), current use 
      pesticides (CUPs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and selected metals. 
      Contaminants were prevalent in the environment and food web components of the 
      river. PCBs were detected in 32% of biotic samples (mean 0.24μg/g dry weight 
      [DW], range 0.01-3.33μg/g DW), and DDTs (legacy OCPs and metabolites) were 
      detected in 90% (mean 0.014μg/g DW, range 0.0004-0.29μg/g DW). The trace metals 
      manganese and cadmium exceeded published threshold effect concentrations in 
      sediment (460 and 0.99μg/g DW, respectively). Mercury was detected in all food 
      web samples exhibiting a mean of 0.61μg/g DW and range 0.006-2.35μg/g DW (mean 
      0.13μg/g wet weight [WW], range 0.001-0.6μg/g WW). Concentrations exceeded the 
      0.2μg/g WW aquatic life criterion for mercury in 38% of fish samples. Fish 
      trophic magnification factors (TMFs; range 0.33-3.75) indicated that contaminant 
      accumulation occurred from both water and dietary sources. The combination of 
      analytical approaches applied here provides new insight into contaminant dynamics 
      with conservation implications.

TI  - Trophic structure and origin of resources of soil macrofauna in the salt marsh of 
      the Wadden Sea: a stable isotope ((15)N, (13)C) study.
PG  - 85

LID - 85
AB  - Salt marshes exist along the gradient of the marine mudflat to the terrestrial 
      dunes, with a gradient of shore height and associated plant zonation. The lower 
      salt marsh (LSM) extends from the mean high tidal level to 35 cm above that level 
      and is followed by the upper salt marsh (USM). Despite changes in the amount of 
      allochthonous marine input and in abiotic conditions, little is known about 
      changes in the trophic structure and used of basal resources by the soil 
      macrofauna along marine-terrestrial boundaries. Natural variations in carbon 
      stable isotope ratios (δ(13)C signatures) allow insight into basal resources of 
      consumers such as marine algae, terrestrial C3 and C4 photosynthesising plants. 
      Furthermore, variations in nitrogen stable isotope ratios (δ(15)N signatures) 
      allow insight into the trophic position of consumers. We investigated spatial and 
      temporal changes in stable isotope signatures in salt marsh soil macrofauna of 
      the island of Spiekeroog, German Wadden Sea. The range of δ(15)N signatures 
      indicated no changes in food chain length across salt marsh zones with consumers 
      in both zones comprising primary decomposers, secondary decomposers and first 
      order predators. However, the trophic position of individual species changed 
      between zones, but in particular with season. Contrasting δ(15)N signatures, the 
      range in δ(13)C signatures in the LSM was twice that in the USM indicating a 
      wider range of resources consumed. Bayesian mixing models indicated predominant 
      autochthonous resource use in both the LSM and USM, with the use of marine 
      allochthonous resources never exceeding 29.6%. However, the models also indicate 
      an increase in the use of marine resources in certain species in the LSM with no 
      use in the USM. Overall, the results indicate that the resource use of salt marsh 
      macrofauna varies more in space than in time, with the food web being generally 
      based on autochthonous rather than allochthonous resources. However, there also 
      is trophic plasticity in certain species across both temporal and spatial scales 
      including variations in the use of allochthonous resources. Generally, however, 
      marine input contributes little to the nutrition of salt marsh soil 
      macroinvertebrates.

AB  - Using C and N isotopic signatures of food web components, we evaluated the 
      land-marine coupling through nutrient flows and the likely changes in the food 
      web structure in tidal channels with contrasting anthropogenic nutrient inputs at 
      a semi desert-macrotidal coastal system (northern Argentine Patagonia). The 
      results showed an increase in the δ(13)C signatures of primary producers and in 
      the δ(15)N signatures in all levels of the benthic food web, from primary 
      producers to predators, with possible changes in the relative contribution of 
      primary food sources for consumer in the tidal channel with high anthropogenic N 
      input. This is an example on the extent of the distribution of anthropogenic N 
      into natural systems, flowing through the food web from terrestrial origin to 
      coastal marine components.

      quantify food chain length and trophic structure.
PG  - e93281

AB  - Increasingly, stable isotope ratios of nitrogen (δ(15)N) and carbon (δ(13)C) are 
      used to quantify trophic structure, though relatively few studies have tested 
      accuracy of isotopic structural measures. For laboratory-raised and 
      wild-collected plant-invertebrate food chains spanning four trophic levels we 
      estimated nitrogen range (NR) using δ(15)N, and carbon range (CR) using δ(13)C, 
      which are used to quantify food chain length and breadth of trophic resources 
      respectively. Across a range of known food chain lengths we examined how NR and 
      CR changed within and between food chains. Our isotopic estimates of structure 
      are robust because they were calculated using resampling procedures that 
      propagate variance in sample means through to quantified uncertainty in final 
      estimates. To identify origins of uncertainty in estimates of NR and CR, we 
      additionally examined variation in discrimination (which is change in δ(15)N or 
      δ(13)C from source to consumer) between trophic levels and among food chains. 
      δ(15)N discrimination showed significant enrichment, while variation in 
      enrichment was species and system specific, ranged broadly (1.4‰ to 3.3‰), and 
      importantly, propagated variation to subsequent estimates of NR. However, NR 
      proved robust to such variation and distinguished food chain length well, though 
      some overlap between longer food chains infers a need for awareness of such 
      limitations. δ(13)C discrimination was inconsistent; generally no change or small 
      significant enrichment was observed. Consequently, estimates of CR changed little 
      with increasing food chain length, showing the potential utility of δ(13)C as a 
      tracer of energy pathways. This study serves as a robust test of isotopic 
      quantification of food chain structure, and given global estimates of aquatic 
      food chains approximate four trophic levels while many food chains include 
      invertebrates, our use of four trophic level plant-invertebrate food chains makes 
      our findings relevant for a majority of ecological systems.

AB  - The flanks of the Caucasus Mountains and the steppe landscape to their north 
      offered highly productive grasslands for Bronze Age herders and their flocks of 
      sheep, goat, and cattle. While the archaeological evidence points to a largely 
      pastoral lifestyle, knowledge regarding the general composition of human diets 
      and their variation across landscapes and during the different phases of the 
      Bronze Age is still restricted. Human and animal skeletal remains from the burial 
      mounds that dominate the archaeological landscape and their stable isotope 
      compositions are major sources of dietary information. Here, we present stable 
      carbon and nitrogen isotope data of bone collagen of 105 human and 50 animal 
      individuals from the 5th millennium BC to the Sarmatian period, with a strong 
      focus on the Bronze Age and its cultural units including Maykop, Yamnaya, 
      Novotitorovskaya, North Caucasian, Catacomb, post-Catacomb and late Bronze Age 
      groups. The samples comprise all inhumations with sufficient bone preservation 
      from five burial mound sites and a flat grave cemetery as well as subsamples from 
      three further sites. They represent the Caucasus Mountains in the south, the 
      piedmont zone and Kuban steppe with humid steppe and forest vegetation to its 
      north, and more arid regions in the Caspian steppe. The stable isotope 
      compositions of the bone collagen of humans and animals varied across the study 
      area and reflect regional diversity in environmental conditions and diets. The 
      data agree with meat, milk, and/or dairy products from domesticated herbivores, 
      especially from sheep and goats having contributed substantially to human diets, 
      as it is common for a largely pastoral economy. This observation is also in 
      correspondence with the faunal remains observed in the graves and offerings of 
      animals in the mound shells. In addition, foodstuffs with elevated carbon and 
      nitrogen isotope values, such as meat of unweaned animals, fish, or plants, also 
      contributed to human diets, especially among communities living in the more arid 
      landscapes. The regional distinction of the animal and human data with few 
      outliers points to mobility radii that were largely concentrated within the 
      environmental zones in which the respective sites are located. In general, 
      dietary variation among the cultural entities as well as regarding age, sex and 
      archaeologically indicated social status is only weakly reflected. There is, 
      however, some indication for a dietary shift during the Early Bronze Age Maykop 
      period.

AB  - To assess the basal resources supporting food webs impacted by rainfalls, we 
      compared stable isotope ratios (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) of fish consumers and organic 
      matter sources between up- and down-sites in an estuary between seasons (June and 
      September) and years (2018 and 2019) that showed different patterns of summer 
      monsoon. Our study showed seasonal differences in the δ(13)C and δ(15)N values of 
      basal resources and fish consumers in both years. At the up-site, significant 
      differences of δ(13)C values of fish consumers were found between years, 
      resulting from changing rainfall period, thereby causing a shift in food 
      availability from terrigenous organic matter to periphyton. In contrast, at the 
      down-site, the consistent isotopic values of fishes were observed in both years, 
      suggesting that rainfall shift has a negligible impact on resources for fishes. 
      Overall, the annual shift in resources for fishes in the estuary may be 
      controlled by contrasting rainfall events.

AB  - Mathematical models are frequently used in terrestrial radioecology to interpret 
      observations and to assess the detrimental impacts of radioactive releases to the 
      environment. Conventional radioecological models are largely based on equilibrium 
      and empirical relationships with reasonable data requirements, making them 
      practical tools for long-term assessments. But conventional models may be 
      inadequate to simulate radionuclide dynamics in terrestrial environments 
      realistically. Specifically, the structure of such models seldom conforms to the 
      physics of water flow and solute transport in soils. The equilibrium 
      relationships may fail to predict seasonality in radionuclide transfer between 
      environmental compartments; model transferability between sites is often hampered 
      by its empirical nature. Numerous studies have highlighted the need to circumvent 
      these limitations. In this paper, we introduce dynamic and process-based 
      modelling to a conventional radioecological model by coupling an empirical plant 
      module to a process-based soil module that simulates water flow, solute transport 
      and root uptake in the soil column. Illustrative simulations are presented using 
      the coupled model and stable chlorine cycling in a temperate Scots pine (Pinus 
      sylvestris L.) stand as an example. The model satisfactorily reproduced soil 
      moisture dynamics and the inventory of inorganic chlorine in the tree and forest 
      floor compartments. The inventory of organic chlorine in the stand, however, was 
      overestimated, indicating that processes pertinent to organochlorine cycling at 
      the stand were missing from the model. The approach proposed in this paper is a 
      step towards dynamic and process-based modelling in terrestrial radioecology and 
      impact assessment. It can be particularly useful for modelling transfer of 
      elements, such as redox-sensitive radionuclides, whose behaviour in soil-plant 
      systems is moisture-dependent.

AB  - In contrast to aquatic food chains, knowledge of the origins and transfer of 
      mercury (Hg) and methylmercury (MeHg) in terrestrial food chains is relatively 
      limited, especially in songbirds. We collected soil, rice plants, aquatic and 
      terrestrial invertebrates, small wild fish, and resident songbird feathers from 
      an Hg-contaminated rice paddy ecosystem for an analysis of stable Hg isotopes to 
      clarify the sources of Hg and its transfer in songbirds and their prey. 
      Significant mass-dependent fractionation (MDF, δ(202)Hg), but no mass-independent 
      fractionation (MIF, ∆(199)Hg) occurred in the trophic transfers in terrestrial 
      food chains. Piscivorous, granivorous, and frugivorous songbirds and aquatic 
      invertebrates were all characterized by elevated Δ(199)Hg values. The estimated 
      MeHg isotopic compositions obtained using linear fitting and a binary mixing 
      model explained both the terrestrial and aquatic origins of MeHg in the 
      terrestrial food chains. We found that MeHg from aquatic habitats is an important 
      subsidy for terrestrial songbirds, even those that feed mainly on seeds, fruits, 
      or cereals. The results show that MIF of the MeHg isotope is a reliable tool to 
      reveal MeHg sources in songbirds. Because the MeHg isotopic compositions was 
      calculated with a binary mixing model or directly estimated from the high 
      proportions of MeHg, compound-specific isotope analysis of Hg would be more 
      useful for the interpretation of the Hg sources, and is highly recommended for 
      future studies.

AB  - The paper evaluates the species richness, material transfer, energy flow, and 
      system function of the southwestern Yellow Sea Ecosystem (SYSE) indicating 
      intensive human intervention affecting this large marine ecosystem. Twenty 
      functional groups were chosen to represent the basic components of the SYSE for 
      Ecopath modeling based on offshore surveys, annual bird observations, and the 
      China Fisheries Statistical Yearbooks. Forty-nine species based on 15 functional 
      groups of Ecopath model were assessed by stable isotopic analysis (SIA) to verify 
      ecosystem features, energy flow, and trophic structure of the SYSE derived from 
      Ecopath model. Results showed there was a clear correlation of the estimated 
      trophic structure calculated from SIA and the Ecopath model with R(2)=0.7184. The 
      SYSE Ecopath model was still at an immature and unstable stage according to 
      outputs of the modeling parameters. This paper provides a verification method of 
      detecting the ecosystem features and maturity, stability, and resilience of 
      marine ecosystems by comparing outputs from Ecopath models with SIA.

AB  - Research on food web structures in marine ecosystems is an important field in 
      ecology where the interaction of structure and function contributes to 
      understanding biodiversity. The coastal waters of Jiangsu are one of the 
      important fishing bases in China. In recent years, with the development of 
      industry in the coastal waters of Jiangsu, heavy metal (HM) pollution in this 
      region has become more serious. In this study, all samples (including macroalgae, 
      bivalves, cephalopods, gastropods, crustaceans and fish) were collected in the 
      coastal waters of Jiangsu in spring, summer and autumn. Based on the construction 
      of the food web structure using carbon and nitrogen isotope technology, the main 
      methods of material circulation and energy flow were quantified, and the 
      accumulation regularity and seasonal variation characteristics of HMs in the food 
      web were analysed. The results showed that (1) among all the trophic groups, 
      bivalves had the highest enrichment level of HMs, while fish had the lowest. 
      However, fish have a strong ability to enrich Hg, and the main source of Hg 
      enrichment in the human body is edible fish, so more attention should be given to 
      Hg concentrations in fish. (2) In spring, the mean HM concentrations of marine 
      organisms in the coastal waters of Jiangsu were 
      Zn > Cu > As > Cd > Cr > Pb > Ni > Hg, and they were 
      Zn > Cu > As > Pb > Cd > Ni > Cr > Hg in summer and 
      Zn > Cu > As > Pb > Cd > Cr > Ni > Hg in autumn. In total, the concentrations of 
      Zn, Cu and As were the highest, while the mean concentration of Hg in organisms 
      was the lowest. (3) No significant biomagnification of HMs was found in the three 
      seasons. We speculated that overfishing leads to miniaturization and a younger 
      age of organisms, which makes the concentration of highly enriched HMs in 
      organisms with high trophic levels (TLs) lower.

      Procambarusclarkii in invaded freshwater ecosystems.
PG  - e94411

LID - e94411
AB  - BACKGROUND: Freshwater ecosystems are amongst the most threatened habitats on 
      Earth; nevertheless, they support about 9.5% of the known global biodiversity 
      while covering less than 1% of the globe's surface. A number of anthropogenic 
      pressures are impacting species diversity in inland waters and, amongst them, the 
      spread of invasive alien species is considered one of the main drivers of 
      biodiversity loss and homogenisation in freshwater habitats.Crayfish species are 
      widely distributed freshwater invaders and, while alien species introductions 
      occur mostly accidentally, alien crayfish are often released deliberately into 
      new areas for commercial purposes. After their initial introduction, crayfish 
      species can rapidly establish and reach high-density populations as a result of 
      their adaptive functional traits, such as their generalist diet.The Louisiana 
      crayfish Procambarusclarkii (Girard, 1852) is globally considered one of the 
      worst invaders and its impact on recipient freshwater communities can vary from 
      predation and competition with native species, to modification of food webs and 
      habitat structure and introduction of pathogens. Native to the south United 
      States and north Mexico, P.clarkii has been introduced in Europe, Asia and 
      Africa, determining negative ecological and economic impacts in the majority of 
      invaded habitats where it became dominant within the receiving benthic food webs. 
      Due to its flexible feeding strategy, P.clarkii exerts adverse effects at 
      different trophic levels, ultimately affecting the structure and dynamics of 
      invaded food webs. It is, therefore, paramount to evaluate the ecological 
      consequences of P.clarkii invasion and to quantify its impact in a spatially 
      explicit context. NEW INFORMATION: In the past decades, the analysis of stable 
      isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and other elements has become a popular methodology 
      in food web ecology. Notably, stable isotope analysis has emerged as a primary 
      tool for addressing applied issues in biodiversity conservation and management, 
      such as the assessment of the trophic ecology of non-indigenous species in 
      invaded habitats. Here, we built two geo-referenced datasets, resolved 
      respectively at the population and individual scale, by collating information on 
      δ(13)C and δ(15)N values of P.clarkii within invaded inland waters. The 
      population-scale dataset consists of 160 carbon and nitrogen isotopic values of 
      the Louisiana crayfish and its potential prey, including living and non-living 
      primary producers and benthic invertebrates. The dataset resolved at individual 
      scale consists of 1,168 isotopic records of P.clarkii. The isotopic values 
      included within the two datasets were gathered from 10 countries located in 
      Europe, Asia, Africa and North America, for a total of 41 studies published 
      between 2005 and 2021. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this effort 
      represents the first attempt to collate in standardised datasets the sparse 
      isotopic information of P.clarkii available in literature. The datasets lend 
      themselves to being used for providing a spatially explicit resolution of the 
      trophic ecology of P.clarkii and to address a variety of ecological questions 
      concerning its ecological impact on recipient aquatic food webs.

TI  - Vanadate reducing bacteria and archaea may use different mechanisms to reduce

AB  - Vanadium (V) is a transitional metal that poses health risks to exposed humans. 
      Microorganisms play an important role in remediating V contamination by reducing 
      more toxic and mobile vanadate (V(V)) to less toxic and mobile V(IV). In this 
      study, DNA-stable isotope probing (SIP) coupled with metagenomic-binning was used 
      to identify microorganisms responsible for V(V) reduction and determine potential 
      metabolic mechanisms in cultures inoculated with a V-contaminated river sediment. 
      Anaeromyxobacter and Geobacter spp. were identified as putative V(V)-reducing 
      bacteria, while Methanosarcina spp. were identified as putative V(V)-reducing 
      archaea. The bacteria may use the two nitrate reductases NarG and NapA for 
      respiratory V(V) reduction, as has been demonstrated previously for other 
      species. It is proposed that Methanosarcina spp. may reduce V(V) via anaerobic 
      methane oxidation pathways (AOM-V) rather than via respiratory V(V) reduction 
      performed by their bacterial counterparts, as indicated by the presence of genes 
      associated with anaerobic methane oxidation coupled with metal reduction in the 
      metagenome assembled genome (MAG) of Methanosarcina. Briefly, methane may be 
      oxidized through the "reverse methanogenesis" pathway to produce electrons, which 
      may be further captured by V(V) to promote V(V) reduction. More specially, V(V) 
      reduction by members of Methanosarcina may be driven by electron transport 
      (CoMS-SCoB heterodisulfide reductase (HdrDE), F(420)H(2) dehydrogenases (Fpo), 
      and multi-heme c-type cytochrome (MHC)). The identification of putative 
      V(V)-reducing bacteria and archaea and the prediction of their different pathways 
      for V(V) reduction expand current knowledge regarding the potential fate of V(V) 
      in contaminated sites.

AB  - Stable isotope probing (SIP) is a cultivation-independent approach identifying 
      the functional microbes in their natural habitats, possibly linking their 
      identities to functions. DNA-SIP is well-established but suffers from the shift 
      of (12)C-DNA into the heavy DNA ((13)C-DNA) fraction, which significantly reduces 
      the resolution and accuracy. In this study, we coupled magnetic-nanoparticle 
      mediated isolation (MMI) and DNA-SIP, namely MMI-SIP, to identify the active 
      microbes involved in phenanthrene degradation from PAH-contaminated wastewater. 
      Microbes affiliated to Pseudomonas and Sphingobium were responsible for in situ 
      phenanthrene metabolism from the SIP results, and Pigmentiphaga was only 
      unraveled for phenanthrene degradation in the MMI and MMI-SIP microcosms. MMI-SIP 
      also significantly increased the enrichment of the above microbes and genes 
      encoding the alpha subunit of the PAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenase (PAH-RHD(α)) 
      in the heavy DNA fractions. Our findings suggest that MMI-SIP is a powerful tool, 
      with higher resolution and accuracy, to distinguish the active microbes involved 
      in phenanthrene metabolism in the wastewater, provide a more precise map of 
      functional microbial communities, and offer suggestions for effective management 
      for wastewater treatment plants.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) is a global pollutant of concern because its organic and more toxic 
      form, methylHg (MeHg), bioaccumulates and biomagnifies through aquatic food webs 
      to levels that affect the health of fish and fish consumers, including humans. 
      Although much is known about trophic transfer of MeHg in aquatic food webs at 
      temperate latitudes in the northern hemisphere, it is unclear whether its fate is 
      similar in biota from coastal zones of the southeastern Pacific. To assess this 
      gap, MeHg, total Hg and food web structure (using δ(13)C and δ(15)N) were 
      measured in marine macroinvertebrates, fishes, birds, and mammals from Patagonian 
      fjords and the Antarctic Peninsula. Trophic magnification slopes (TMS; log MeHg 
      versus δ(15)N) for coastal food webs of Patagonia were high when compared with 
      studies in the northern hemisphere, and significantly higher near freshwater 
      inputs as compared to offshore sites (0.244 vs 0.192). Similarly, in Antarctica, 
      the site closer to glacial inputs had a significantly higher TMS than the one in 
      the Southern Shetland Islands (0.132 vs 0.073). Composition of the food web also 
      had an influence, as the TMS increased when mammals and seabirds were excluded 
      (0.132-0.221) at a coastal site. This study found that both the composition of 
      the food web and the proximity to freshwater outflows are key factors influencing 
      the TMS for MeHg in Patagonian and Antarctic food webs.

AB  - Arctic species are likely to experience rapid shifts in prey availability under 
      climate change, which may alter their exposure to microbes and parasites. Here, 
      we describe fecal bacterial and macroparasite communities and assess correlations 
      with diet trophic level in Pacific walruses harvested during subsistence hunts by 
      members of the Native Villages of Gambell and Savoonga on St Lawrence Island, 
      Alaska. Fecal bacterial communities were dominated by relatively few taxa, mostly 
      belonging to phyla Fusobacteriota and Firmicutes. Members of parasite-associated 
      phyla Nematoda, Acanthocephala and Platyhelminthes were prevalent in our study 
      population. We hypothesized that high versus low prey trophic level (e.g. fish 
      versus bivalves) would result in different gut bacterial and macroparasite 
      communities. We found that bacterial community structure correlated to diet, with 
      nine clades enriched in walruses consuming higher-trophic-level prey. While no 
      parasite compositional differences were found at the phylum level, the cestode 
      genus Diphyllobothrium was more prevalent and abundant in walruses consuming 
      higher-trophic-level prey, probably because fish are the intermediate hosts for 
      this genus. This study suggests that diet is important for structuring both 
      parasite and microbial communities of this culturally and ecologically important 
      species, with potential implications for population health under climate change.

      Georgia Bight.
PG  - 197-214
AB  - Measurement of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta 13C and delta 
      15N) in samples of human bone collagen (n = 93) from a temporal series of four 
      prehistoric (early preagricultural, late preagricultural, early agricultural, 
      late agricultural) and two historic (early contact, late contact) periods from 
      the Georgia Bight, a continental embayment on the southeastern U.S. Atlantic 
      coast, reveals a general temporal trend for less negative delta 13C values and 
      less positive delta 15N values. This trend reflects a concomitant decrease in 
      emphasis on marine resources and increased reliance on C4-based resources, 
      especially maize. This dietary reorientation is most apparent for the early 
      agricultural sample (AD 1150-1300), coinciding with the Mississippian 
      fluorescence in the eastern United States. There is, however, a shift toward the 
      use of C3 (non-maize) foods during the last prehistoric period (AD 1300-1450), 
      which is likely related to environmental stress and social disruption. A heavier 
      use of maize and terrestrial resources in general after the establishment of 
      mission centers on barrier islands is indicated. A reduced dietary breadth during 
      the mission period may have contributed to the extinction of these populations in 
      the eighteenth century.

AB  - Species interactions are central in predicting the impairment of biodiversity 
      with climate change. Trophic interactions may be altered through 
      climate-dependent changes in either predator food preferences or prey 
      communities. Yet, climate change impacts on predator diet remain surprisingly 
      poorly understood. We experimentally studied the consequences of 2°C warmer 
      climatic conditions on the trophic niche of a generalist lizard predator. We used 
      a system of semi-natural mesocosms housing a variety of invertebrate species and 
      in which climatic conditions were manipulated. Lizards in warmer climatic 
      conditions ate at a greater predatory to phytophagous invertebrate ratio and had 
      smaller individual dietary breadths. These shifts mainly arose from direct 
      impacts of climate on lizard diets rather than from changes in prey communities. 
      Dietary changes were associated with negative changes in fitness-related traits 
      (body condition, gut microbiota) and survival. We demonstrate that climate change 
      alters trophic interactions through top-predator dietary shifts, which might 
      disrupt eco-evolutionary dynamics.

TI  - Elevated Allochthony in Stream Food Webs as a Result of Longitudinal Cumulative 
      Effects of Forest Management.
PG  - 1311-1327
LID - 10.1007/s10021-021-00717-6 [doi]
AB  - The river continuum concept (RCC) predicts a downstream shift in the reliance of 
      aquatic consumers from terrestrial to aquatic carbon sources, but this concept 
      has rarely been assessed with longitudinal studies. Similarly, there are no 
      studies addressing how forestry related disturbances to the structure of 
      headwater food webs manifest (accumulate/dissipate) downstream and/or whether 
      forest management alters natural longitudinal trends predicted by the RCC. Using 
      stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen, we investigated how: 1) 
      autochthony in macroinvertebrates and fish change from small streams to larger 
      downstream sites within a basin with minimal forest management (New Brunswick, 
      Canada); 2) longitudinal trends in autochthony and food web length compare among 
      three basins with different forest management intensity [intensive (harvest and 
      replanting), extensive (harvest only), minimal] to detect potential 
      cumulative/dissipative effects; and 3) forest management intensity and other 
      catchment variables are influencing food web dynamics. We showed that, as 
      predicted, the reliance of some macroinvertebrate taxa (especially collector 
      feeders) on algae increased from small streams to downstream waters in the 
      minimally managed basin, but that autochthony in the smallest shaded stream was 
      higher than expected based on the RCC (as high as 90% for some taxa). However, 
      this longitudinal increase in autochthony was not observed within the extensively 
      managed basin and was weaker within the intensively managed one, suggesting that 
      forest management can alter food web dynamics along the river continuum. The 
      dampening of downstream autochthony indicates that the increased allochthony 
      observed in small streams in response to forest harvesting cumulates downstream 
      through the river continuum. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version

AB  - The stable nitrogen isotope ratio δ(15)N is used as a marker of dietary protein 
      sources in blood. Crop fertilization strategies affect δ(15)N in plant foods. In 
      a double-blinded randomized cross-over dietary intervention trial with 33 
      participants, we quantified the effect of fertilizer type (conventional: 
      synthetic fertilizer and organic: animal or green manure) on δ(15)N in blood 
      plasma. At study baseline, plasma δ(15)N was +9.34 ± 0.29‰ (mean ± standard 
      deviation). After 12 days intervention with a diet based on crops fertilized with 
      animal manure, plasma δ(15)N was shifted by +0.27 ± 0.04‰ (mean ± standard error) 
      compared to synthetic fertilization and by +0.22 ± 0.04‰ compared to 
      fertilization with green manure (both p < 0.0001). Accordingly, differences in 
      the δ(15)N values between fertilizers are propagated to the blood plasma of human 
      consumers. The results indicate a need to consider agricultural practices when 
      using δ(15)N as a dietary biomarker.

AB  - Bivalve aquaculture farms are an integral part of the surrounding coastal marine 
      ecosystem and associated food webs. What is not well understood is how these 
      anthropogenically manipulated, dense, single-species cultures influence species 
      trophodynamics in the coastal ocean. Fouling macrofauna biodiversity, macroalgae 
      biomass, sediment, and food web structure were studied at two blue mussel 
      (Mytilus edulis) floating raft rope-culture aquaculture farm structures and two 
      analogous floating dock structures without mussels in Casco Bay, Maine, USA 
      during the summers of 2016 and 2017. Shannon Wiener diversity index of macrofauna 
      was variable across structures compared depending on month. Macroalgae biomass 
      was significantly higher on farm structures exclusively due to green macroalgae. 
      There was no shift in food web structure determined by stable isotope analysis 
      (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) and Layman metrics. This study is an initial step critical to 
      assessing interactions of bivalve farms with coastal food webs.

AB  - As long-lived apex predators in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) of China, 
      Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) are particularly vulnerable to 
      anthropogenic impact and may undergo considerable ecological trait changes. The 
      variability of traits, however, is often difficult to trace back in nature. Here, 
      we analyzed stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen in muscle samples of 88 
      S. chinensis stranded in the PRE from 2004 to 2016 to investigate the ecological 
      changes occurring in the dolphins. Stable isotope analysis revealed the existence 
      of two sub-aggregations of S. chinensis in the PRE. Generalized additive models 
      showed significant decreasing trends in both carbon and nitrogen isotopic 
      signatures over time, indicating the habitat changes and dietary shifts, possibly 
      due to the influence of increased coastal developments and fishing activities in 
      the PRE. Diet modeling suggests that the proportional contribution of higher 
      trophic-level prey decreased in the S. chinensis diet over time, while increased 
      consumption of lower trophic-level prey was observed. This shift was related to 
      depletion of higher trophic-level prey caused by overfishing. Although S. 
      chinensis could temporarily compensate for the lost energy supply through feeding 
      plasticity (revealed by the negligible differences of isotope niche width among 
      different stranding periods), long-term depletion in prey availability may cause 
      long-lasting negative effects on this dolphin population. This study highlights 
      the crucial relationships between fishery management and dolphin conservation, 
      providing scientific evidence for the long-term protection of this threatened 
      species in the PRE region.

AB  - Flame retardants (FR) are industrial chemicals and some are proven environmental 
      contaminants that accumulate in predatory birds. Few studies have examined the 
      influence of diet on FR profiles in nestling raptors and the possible 
      physiological implications of such FR exposure. The objectives of this research 
      were (1) to determine spatial patterns of ≤ 48 polybrominated diphenyl ether 
      (PBDE) congeners and ≤ 26 non-PBDE FRs, including organophosphate esters (OPEs), 
      in nestling peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) across the Canadian Great 
      Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin (GL-SLR; 2010) and in the eastern Canadian Arctic 
      (2007); (2) to identify temporal changes in FR concentrations from the mid-2000s 
      to 2010 in GL-SLR peregrine nestlings; (3) to investigate the role of diet using 
      stable isotopes on exposure patterns of quantifiable FRs; and (4) to assess 
      possible associations between circulating FRs and total (T) thyroxine (TT(4)) and 
      triiodothyronine (TT(3)), tocopherol, retinol and oxidative status 
      (isoprostanes). The summed concentrations of the top 5 PBDEs (Σ(5)) (BDE-47, -99, 
      -100, -154, -153) were significantly higher in rural nestlings than urban 
      nestlings in the GL-SLR, followed by the eastern Arctic nestlings. The PBDE 
      congener profile of rural nestlings was dominated by BDE-99 (34‰), whereas 
      BDE-209 (31‰) became dominant in the 2010 urban PBDE profile marking a shift 
      since the mid-2000s. Low (ppb) concentrations of 25 novel non-PBDE FRs (e.g., 
      1,2-bis-(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane (BTBPE), decabromodiphenylethane (DBDPE)) 
      were measured in the nestlings in at least one region, with the first report in 
      peregrines of 15 novel non-PBDE FRs (e.g., 2-ethyl-1-hyxyl 
      2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoate (EHTBB), pentabromo allyl ether (PBPAE), 
      tetrabromoethylcyclohexane (α-, β-DBE-DBCH)) as well as of tris (2-butoxyethyl) 
      phosphate (TBOEP) (0-7.5ng/g ww) > tris(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP) 
      (0.1-5.5ng/g ww) > tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) (0.02-2.0ng/g ww) > 
      tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) (0-1.0ng/g ww). Within the GL-SLR, 
      the urban nestlings' diet had significantly more terrestrial sources (greater 
      δ(13)C values) than the broader, more aquatic-based diet of rural peregrines. 
      Dietary source (δ(13)C) was significantly associated with concentrations of 
      Σ(5)PBDE, BDE-209, EHTBB, and 2,2-4,4',5,5'-hexabromobiphenyl (BB-153), with 
      trophic level (δ(15)N) also positively associated with BDE-209 levels. Compared 
      to urban nestlings, the rural nestlings had significantly lower circulating 
      concentrations of thyroxine (TT(4)), triiodothyronine (TT(3)), a greater 
      proportion of TT(3) relative to TT(4) (TT(3):TT(4)), tocopherol and oxidative 
      status (isoprostanes), but higher retinol levels; the most recalcitrant PBDE 
      congener, BDE-153, in combination with low concentrations of some novel FRs, 
      particularly octabromotrimethylphenyllindane (OBIND), may influence circulating 
      thyroid hormones, especially TT(4), and retinol levels of peregrine falcon 
      nestlings. These associations of FR-endocrine-biochemical measures suggest 
      possible exposure-related changes in these birds and further study is warranted.

AB  - Tiger sharks were sampled off the western (Ningaloo Reef, Shark Bay) and eastern 
      (the Great Barrier Reef; GBR, Queensland and New South Wales; NSW) coastlines of 
      Australia. Multiple tissues were collected from each shark to investigate the 
      effects of location, size and sex of sharks on δ(13)C and δ(15)N stable isotopes 
      among these locations. Isotopic composition of sharks sampled in reef and 
      seagrass habitats (Shark Bay, GBR) reflected seagrass-based food-webs, whereas at 
      Ningaloo Reef analysis revealed a dietary transition between pelagic and seagrass 
      food-webs. In temperate habitats off southern Queensland and NSW coasts, shark 
      diets relied on pelagic food-webs. Tiger sharks occupied roles at the top of 
      food-webs at Shark Bay and on the GBR, but not at Ningaloo Reef or off the coast 
      of NSW. Composition of δ(13)C in tissues was influenced by body size and sex of 
      sharks, in addition to residency and diet stability. This variability in stable 
      isotopic composition of tissues is likely to be a result of adaptive foraging 
      strategies that allow these sharks to exploit multiple shelf and offshore 
      habitats. The trophic role of tiger sharks is therefore both context- and 
      habitat-dependent, consistent with a generalist, opportunistic diet at the 
      population level.

AB  - Stable carbon isotope analysis in tooth enamel is a well-established approach to 
      infer C3 and C4 dietary composition in fossil mammals. The bulk of past work has 
      been conducted on large herbivorous mammals. One important finding is that their 
      dietary habits of fossil large mammals track the late Miocene ecological shift 
      from C3 forest and woodland to C4 savannah. However, few studies on carbon 
      isotopes of fossil small mammals exist due to limitations imposed by the size of 
      rodent teeth, and the isotopic ecological and dietary behaviors of small mammals 
      to climate change remain unknown. Here we evaluate the impact of ecological 
      change on small mammals by fine-scale comparisons of carbon isotope ratios 
      (δ(13)C) with dental morphology of murine rodents, spanning 13.8 to ∼2.0 Ma, 
      across the C3 to C4 vegetation shift in the Miocene Siwalik sequence of Pakistan. 
      We applied in-situ laser ablation GC-IRMS to lower first molars and measured two 
      grazing indices on upper first molars. Murine rodents yield a distinct, but 
      related, record of past ecological conditions from large herbivorous mammals, 
      reflecting available foods in their much smaller home ranges. In general, larger 
      murine species show more positive δ(13)C values and have higher grazing indices 
      than smaller species inhabiting the same area at any given age. Two clades of 
      murine rodents experienced different rates of morphological change. In the 
      faster-evolving clade, the timing and trend of morphological innovations are 
      closely tied to consumption of C4 diet during the vegetation shift. This study 
      provides quantitative evidence of linkages among diet, niche partitioning, and 
      dental morphology at a more detailed level than previously possible.

AB  - Degradation of riparian zones can alter aquatic and terrestrial communities of 
      flora and fauna and disrupt their role in assimilating and mobilising carbon 
      between the two ecosystems. Riparian spiders that predate on emergent aquatic 
      invertebrates can contribute to carbon flux and the structure of aquatic and 
      riparian food webs. The impact of riparian degradation on spiders in temperate 
      rivers of Australia and their role in this broader ecosystem function is poorly 
      understood. We surveyed the riparian zone of four rivers of south-western 
      Australia in areas of natural intact vegetation and degraded agricultural land to 
      explore whether riparian spider abundance, and diversity may be affected by 
      changes to riparian condition. We also assessed the impact of the riparian 
      condition on carbon fluxes between aquatic and terrestrial environments, using 
      stable isotope analysis. We found overall abundance of riparian spiders was 
      higher in degraded agricultural sites compared to natural intact sites and the 
      structure of spider assemblages was different. Orb-weaver spiders (Araneidae and 
      Tetragnathidae) were found to be more abundant in agricultural areas where canopy 
      cover and understory are sparse as a result of livestock grazing and trampling. 
      The contribution of carbon from aquatic invertebrates in a natural intact site 
      was 48.5% for Orb-weavers and 41.6% for Cursorial Hunter spiders but reduced to 
      19.6% and 39.9% respectively in a degraded agricultural site. These results 
      suggest that the position of spiders in riparian food webs and the amount of 
      aquatic subsidy may change according to the condition and complexity of the 
      riparian zone.

AB  - This study sought to estimate the effect of an anthropogenic and climate-driven 
      change in prey availability on the degree of individual and population 
      specialization of a large marine predator, the fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus). 
      We examined skin biopsies from 99 fin whales sampled in the St. Lawrence Estuary 
      (Canada) over a nine year period (1998-2006) during which environmental change 
      was documented. We analyzed stable isotope ratios in skin and fatty acid 
      signatures in blubber samples of whales, as well as in seven potential prey 
      species, and diet was quantitatively assessed using Bayesian isotopic models. An 
      abrupt change in fin whale dietary niche coincided with a decrease in biomass of 
      their predominant prey, Arctic krill (Thysanoessa spp.). This dietary niche 
      widening toward generalist diets occurred in nearly 60% of sampled individuals. 
      The fin whale population, typically composed of specialists of either krill or 
      lipid-rich pelagic fishes, shifted toward one composed either of krill 
      specialists or true generalists feeding on various zooplankton and fish prey. 
      This change likely reduced intraspecific competition. In the context of the 
      current "Atlantification" of northern water masses, our findings emphasize the 
      importance of considering individual-specific foraging tactics and not only 
      population or group average responses when assessing population resilience or 
      when implementing conservation measures.

AB  - During the last several decades, persistent organic pollutants and metals cause 
      great concern for their toxicity in organisms as well as for their 
      bioaccumulation and/or trophic transfer through the food chains in ecosystems. A 
      large number of studies therefore have focused on the trophic levels of organisms 
      to illustrate food web structure, as a critical component in the study of 
      pollutant dynamics and biomagnification. The trends in biomagnification of 
      pollutants in food webs indeed provide fundamental information about the 
      properties and fates of pollutants in ecosystems. The trophic magnification 
      supports the establishment of a reliable trophic structure, which can further aid 
      the understanding of the transport and exposure routes of contaminants in 
      accumulation and risk assessments. Recently, efforts to interpret the food web 
      structure using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios have contributed to 
      better understanding of the fate of pollutants in the ecosystem. However, it is 
      known that this isotope analysis of bulk ones has many weaknesses, particularly 
      for uncertainties on the estimate of trophic levels and therefore of 
      magnification factors for studied organisms, enough to support a regulatory 
      interpretation. In this review, we collate studies that investigated 
      biomagnification characteristics of pollutants in aquatic ecosystems, along with 
      calculated trophic magnification factors. Moreover, we introduce a novel 
      approach, compound-specific stable isotope analysis of nitrogen in amino acids, 
      to establish reliable food web structures and accurate trophic levels for 
      biomagnification studies. This method promises to provide sound results for 
      interpreting the influence of the pollutant in organisms, along with their 
      bioaccumulation and magnification characteristics, as well as that in ecosystem.

AB  - Changes in the ecological stoichiometry of primary producers may have 
      considerable implications for energy and matter transfer in food webs. We 
      hypothesized that nutrient enrichment shifts the trophic position of omnivores 
      towards herbivory, as the nutritional quality of primary producers increases. 
      This hypothesis was tested by analyzing the ecological stoichiometry and stable 
      isotope signature of primary producers and a wide range of aquatic 
      macroinvertebrates, including primary consumers (herbivores) and secondary 
      consumers (both potential omnivores and strict carnivores), along a 
      eutrophication gradient in an agricultural landscape. Our results showed (1) that 
      carbon : nutrient ratios of primary producers decreased along the eutrophication 
      gradient, while the elemental composition of consumers remained homeostatic, and 
      (2) that the trophic position of several omnivores and the generalist predator 
      Notonecta decreased, while the trophic position of most other consumers remained 
      constant. These findings suggest that shifts in the diets of aquatic 
      invertebrates induced by increasing eutrophication may affect species 
      interactions and food web structure in aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - 1. Trophic structure within a guild can be influenced by factors such as resource 
      availability and competition. While ants occupy a wide range of positions in food 
      webs, and ant community composition changes with habitat, it is not well 
      understood if ant genera tend to maintain their position in the trophic 
      structure, or if trophic position varies across habitats. 2. We used ratios of 
      stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen to test for differences in the trophic 
      structure and position of assemblages of ants among habitat types. We tested for 
      differences between assemblages in replicate sites of the land use categories: 
      (i) pastures with old large trees; (ii) recently revegetated pastures with small 
      young trees; and (iii) remnant woodlands. Known insect herbivores and predatory 
      spiders provided baselines for herbivorous and predaceous arthropods. Soil 
      samples were used to correct for the base level of isotopic enrichment at each 
      site. 3. We found no significant interactions between land use and ant genus for 
      isotope enrichment, indicating that trophic structure is conserved across land 
      use categories. The fixed relative positions of genera in the trophic structure 
      might be re-enforced by competition or some other factor. However, the entire ant 
      assemblage had significantly lower δ(15) N values in revegetated sites, 
      suggesting that ants feed lower down in the food chain i.e. they are more 
      'herbivorous' in revegetated sites. This may be a result of the high availability 
      of plant sugars, honeydew and herbivorous arthropod prey. 4. Surprisingly, ants 
      in remnants and pastures with trees displayed similar isotopic compositions. 
      Interactions within ant assemblages are thus likely to be resilient to changes in 
      land use, but ant diets in early successional habitats may reflect the simplicity 
      of communities, which may have comparatively lower rates of saprophagy and 
      predation.

AB  - The biomagnification of toxic methylmercury (MeHg) and selenium (Se) through 
      aquatic food webs using nitrogen stable isotopes (δ(15)N) varies among ecosystems 
      but underlying mechanisms are yet unexplained. Given the strong links between 
      MeHg and thiol-containing amino acids and proteins containing selenocysteine, our 
      hypothesis was that cysteine content is a better predictor of MeHg and Se 
      transfer through lake food webs than δ(15)N. Food web samples were collected from 
      six lakes in Kejimkujik National Park, Nova Scotia, Canada, and the regression 
      slopes of log MeHg or Se versus protein-bound cysteine or bulk δ(15)N were 
      compared. Across all six lakes, MeHg varied by a factor of 10 among taxa and was 
      significantly and positively related to both cysteine (R(2) = 0.65-0.80, 
      p < 0.001) and δ(15)N (R(2) = 0.88-0.94, p < 0.001), with no among-system 
      differences in these slopes. In contrast, total Se concentrations varied by less 
      than a factor of 2 among taxa in four lakes and were significantly related to 
      cysteine in only two food webs (R(2) = 0.20 & 0.37, p = 0.014 & < 0.001); 
      however, δ(15)N was not a predictor of Se in any lake (p = 0.052-0.777). Overall, 
      these novel results indicate that cysteine content predicts MeHg, and sometimes 
      Se, across trophic levels, providing a potential mechanism for among-system 
      differences in their biomagnification.

TI  - Integrating Ecosystem Engineering and Food Web Ecology: Testing the Effect of 
      Biogenic Reefs on the Food Web of a Soft-Bottom Intertidal Area.
PG  - e0140857

AB  - The potential of ecosystem engineers to modify the structure and dynamics of food 
      webs has recently been hypothesised from a conceptual point of view. Empirical 
      data on the integration of ecosystem engineers and food webs is however largely 
      lacking. This paper investigates the hypothesised link based on a field sampling 
      approach of intertidal biogenic aggregations created by the ecosystem engineer 
      Lanice conchilega (Polychaeta, Terebellidae). The aggregations are known to have 
      a considerable impact on the physical and biogeochemical characteristics of their 
      environment and subsequently on the abundance and biomass of primary food sources 
      and the macrofaunal (i.e. the macro-, hyper- and epibenthos) community. 
      Therefore, we hypothesise that L. conchilega aggregations affect the structure, 
      stability and isotopic niche of the consumer assemblage of a soft-bottom 
      intertidal food web. Primary food sources and the bentho-pelagic consumer 
      assemblage of a L. conchilega aggregation and a control area were sampled on two 
      soft-bottom intertidal areas along the French coast and analysed for their stable 
      isotopes. Despite the structural impacts of the ecosystem engineer on the 
      associated macrofaunal community, the presence of L. conchilega aggregations only 
      has a minor effect on the food web structure of soft-bottom intertidal areas. The 
      isotopic niche width of the consumer communities of the L. conchilega 
      aggregations and control areas are highly similar, implying that consumer taxa do 
      not shift their diet when feeding in a L. conchilega aggregation. Besides, 
      species packing and hence trophic redundancy were not affected, pointing to an 
      unaltered stability of the food web in the presence of L. conchilega.

TI  - Different climate sensitivity for radial growth, but uniform for tree-ring stable 
      isotopes along an aridity gradient in Polylepis tarapacana, the world's highest 
      elevation tree species.
PG  - 1353-1371
LID - 10.1093/treephys/tpab021 [doi]
AB  - Tree growth is generally considered to be temperature limited at upper elevation 
      treelines, yet climate factors controlling tree growth at semiarid treelines are 
      poorly understood. We explored the influence of climate on stem growth and stable 
      isotopes for Polylepis tarapacana Philipi, the world's highest elevation tree 
      species, which is found only in the South American Altiplano. We developed 
      tree-ring width index (RWI), oxygen (δ18O) and carbon (δ13C) chronologies for the 
      last 60 years at four P. tarapacana stands located above 4400 m in elevation, 
      along a 500 km latitude aridity gradient. Total annual precipitation decreased 
      from 300 to 200 mm from the northern to the southern sites. We used RWI as a 
      proxy of wood formation (carbon sink) and isotopic tree-ring signatures as 
      proxies of leaf-level gas exchange processes (carbon source). We found distinct 
      climatic conditions regulating carbon sink processes along the gradient. Current 
      growing-season temperature regulated RWI at northern-wetter sites, while prior 
      growing-season precipitation determined RWI at arid southern sites. This suggests 
      that the relative importance of temperature to precipitation in regulating tree 
      growth is driven by site water availability. By contrast, warm and dry growing 
      seasons resulted in enriched tree-ring δ13C and δ18O at all study sites, 
      suggesting that similar climate conditions control carbon-source processes along 
      the gradient. Site-level δ13C and δ18O chronologies were significantly and 
      positively related at all sites, with the strongest relationships among the 
      southern drier stands. This indicates an overall regulation of intercellular 
      carbon dioxide via stomatal conductance for the entire P. tarapacana network, 
      with greater stomatal control when aridity increases. This manuscript also 
      highlights a coupling (decoupling) between physiological processes at leaf level 
      and wood formation as a function of similarities (differences) in their climatic 
      sensitivity. This study contributes to a better understanding and prediction of 
      the response of high-elevation Polylepis woodlands to rapid climate changes and 
      projected drying in the Altiplano.

AB  - The invasive sally lightfoot crab Percnon gibbesi (H. Milne Edwards, 1853) has 
      spread among the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea, including the coasts of Annaba 
      Gulf (Algeria). Investigating the trophic position of the species and looking for 
      the seasonal variations in the diet of this alien decapod was the aim of this 
      study. To do this, samples of P. gibbesi were collected along Annaba coasts 
      within a year. The traditional stomach content analysis (SCA) was integrated to 
      the stable isotope analysis (SIA) of nitrogen and carbon to provide a 
      comprehensive evaluation of the feeding ecology of P. gibbesi, and its 
      within-year variability. Results highlighted, for the first time, significant 
      seasonal variation in P. gibbesi diet, improving our understanding of its trophic 
      plasticity and potential dietary overlaps with other herbivore species. Its 
      feeding plasticity is an asset in the successful expansion of its distribution. 
      Relating its diet composition through the different seasons with the interactions 
      with native herbivores will be essential to fully appreciate the impact of the 
      spread of P. gibbesi in the Mediterranean Sea.

AB  - A key challenge for natural resource management is how to detect effects of 
      environmental stress on individuals and populations before declines in abundance 
      occur. Variability in carbon and nitrogen isotope composition (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) 
      among consumers can provide information on the population trophic niche and how 
      it may change in response to environmental stress. We measured δ(13)C and δ(15)N 
      values in primary producers and in an ecosystem engineer, the bioturbating 
      sandprawn Kraussillichirus kraussi, in Langebaan Lagoon, South Africa, along a 
      human disturbance gradient. Diet partitioning mixing models were coupled with 
      isotope niche analyses and individual body condition data to investigate shifts 
      in resource utilisation and diet plasticity from minimally to highly disturbed 
      sites. The δ(15)N values of seagrass, Zostera capensis indicated a nutrient 
      gradient, with the highest δ(15)N values at highly disturbed sites indicating 
      either anthropogenic or marine nitrogen inputs. A decreasing δ(15)N signal with 
      distance from human disturbance/mouth of lagoon was however not evident for 
      sandprawns nor their presumed dietary sources (phytoplankton, microphytobenthos 
      or sediment organic matter), likely because of faster isotope turnover time 
      compared to seagrass and/or differential fractionation for sandprawns among the 
      sites. Sandprawn isotope niche sizes varied among sites, with no trend along the 
      disturbance gradient. The smallest niche coincided with uniform feeding on 
      microphytobenthos according to mixing models. On an individual level, deviating 
      isotope values from population means were correlated to better body condition, 
      suggesting that a divergent feeding strategy is beneficial. Our results support a 
      generalist feeding behavior of the sandprawns with no evidence of reduced 
      physiological status at the site with most human disturbance.

AB  - Understanding how marine food webs are affected by anthropogenic stressors is an 
      important steppingstone toward the improved management of natural resources. 
      Stable isotope analysis of historical and modern samples spanning a century 
      indicated that the niche width of an exploited fish community increased after the 
      expansion of New Zealand fisheries. Since the 2000s most species increased their 
      reliance on food webs supported by pelagic production, compared to coastal 
      production supported by macroalgae, and shifted to a higher trophic level. 
      Overall changes were coincident with ocean warming, climate oscillations, prey 
      abundance and fishing intensity, but their effects were specific to each fish 
      assemblage analyzed. Data derived from historical samples revealed how 
      anthropogenic stressors can drive long-term shifts in the trophic structure of an 
      exploited fish community.

AB  - Across the globe, lake ecosystems are exposed to a variety of human disturbances. 
      A notable example is shallow lakes where human-induced eutrophication or water 
      level fluctuation may result in a switch from a clear-water, macrophyte-dominated 
      state to a turbid, phytoplankton-dominated state. Yet, few investigations have 
      described synchronous changes in biotic assemblage composition and food web 
      framework under such a shift between alternative states. We used stable carbon 
      and nitrogen isotopes to test the extent to which switching from macrophyte to 
      phytoplankton dominance in Lake Gucheng, triggered by a water level increase, 
      would alter ecosystem structure and change the basal resources supporting the 
      food web. We found that invertebrates and fish compensated for a reduction of 
      macrophyte and epiphyte resources by deriving more energy from the alternative 
      pelagic energy channel, where benthic invertebrates act as crucial links between 
      primary producers and higher consumers by transporting δ(13)C-depleted pelagic 
      algae to the benthic zone. Although consumers can respond to large shifts in 
      energy allocation and stabilize food web dynamics through their ability to feed 
      across multiple energy pathways, our study suggest that energy subsidies may 
      promote trophic cascades and enhance the stability of the turbid regime.

AB  - Climate-driven changes including rising air temperatures, enhanced permafrost 
      degradation, and altered precipitation patterns can have profound effects on 
      contaminants, such as mercury (Hg), in High Arctic lakes. Two physically similar 
      lakes, East Lake and West Lake at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory on 
      Melville Island, Nunavut, Canada are being affected by climate change 
      differently. Both lakes have experienced permafrost degradation in their 
      catchments; however, West Lake has also undergone multiple underwater Mass 
      Movement Events (MMEs; beginning in fall 2008), leading to a sustained 50-fold 
      increase in turbidity. This provided the unique opportunity to understand the 
      potential impacts of permafrost degradation and other climate-related effects on 
      Hg concentrations and body condition of landlocked Arctic char (Salvelinus 
      alpinus), an important sentinel species across the Circum-Arctic. Our objectives 
      were to assess temporal trends in char Hg concentrations and to determine 
      potential mechanisms driving the trends. There was a significant decrease in Hg 
      concentrations in East Lake char, averaging 6.5%/year and 3.8%/year for 
      length-adjusted and age-adjusted means, respectively, from 2008 to 2019. 
      Conversely, in West Lake there was a significant increase, averaging 7.9%/year 
      and 8.0%/year for length-adjusted and age-adjusted mean Hg concentrations, 
      respectively, for 2009 to 2017 (the last year with sufficient sample size). The 
      best predictors of length-adjusted Hg concentrations in West Lake were carbon and 
      nitrogen stable isotope ratios, indicating a shift in diet including possible 
      dietary starvation brought on by the profound increase in lake turbidity. Our 
      study provides an example of how increasing lake turbidity, a likely consequence 
      of climate warming in Arctic lakes, may influence fish condition and Hg 
      concentrations. Environ Toxicol Chem 2023;42:2712-2725. © 2023 His Majesty the

TI  - Predicting the potential implications of perch (Perca fluviatilis) introductions 
      to a biodiversity-rich lake using stable isotope analysis.

AB  - Biological invasions, particularly of fish species, significantly threaten 
      aquatic ecosystems. Among these invaders, the introduction of the European perch 
      (Perca fluviatilis) can have particularly detrimental effects on native 
      communities, affecting both ecosystem functioning and human well-being. In this 
      study, carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis was employed, using perch 
      originating from five different ecosystems, to model the effects of their 
      hypothetical introduction into İznik Lake, an economically and ecologically 
      important, biodiversity-rich lake in northern Turkey, to ultimately assess their 
      potential predation impact and competition with native predators. The results 
      revealed that if perch were introduced to the community, they would - considering 
      gape size limitations - primarily prey upon Vimba vimba and Rutilus rutilus, 
      indicating a significant feeding pressure on these species. Furthermore, the 
      study identified a potential overlap and competition for resources between 
      commonly mesopredator perch and the European catfish Silurus glanis, the current 
      top predator in the ecosystem. Both species would occupy top predatory positions, 
      emphasizing the potential disruption of predator-prey dynamics. Our findings 
      underscore the potential ecological repercussions of perch invasions. The 
      selective predation on V. vimba and R. rutilus, with the latter being consumed to 
      a lesser extent by perch, could lead to cascading effects throughout the food 
      web, altering the community structure, and ecosystem dynamics. Additionally, the 
      competition between perch and S. glanis raises concerns about effects on the 
      stability and functioning of the fish community. These results highlight the need 
      for proactive management strategies to mitigate the risk of perch introductions. 
      Strict regulations on the movement and introduction of invasive species, along 
      with comprehensive monitoring, are crucial for preserving native communities and 
      maintaining the ecological integrity of freshwater ecosystems. Our study 
      demonstrates the potential predation impact of perch on vulnerable fish species 
      and the competition with the established apex predator, emphasizing the 
      importance of considering the ecological consequences of perch invasions and 
      informing management decisions to ensure the conservation and sustainability of 
      aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Dietary shifts and diversities of individual life histories reveal cultural 
      dynamics and interplay of millets and rice in the Chengdu Plain, China during the 
      Late Neolithic (2500-2000 cal. BC).
PG  - 762-776

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We undertook a more comprehensive analyses than our previous study 
      (Yi et al., International Journal of Osteoarchaeology, 2018, 28, 636-644) at the 
      Gaoshan site (~2500-2000 cal. BC) to expand our understanding of the different 
      roles of rice and millets to human subsistence strategies, diachronic shift of 
      human diets, diversity of human life histories and cultural influence (dental 
      ablation) to human population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Carbon and nitrogen 
      isotopic analyses of human (ribs and long bones, n = 68) and animal (n = 15) 
      bones as well as carbonized seeds from rice and millets (n = 8) were undertaken. 
      Human bones were directly AMS-(14) C dated. In addition, sequential sampling of 
      16 individuals with varied age and sex and cultural contexts for isotopic 
      analysis was also conducted. RESULTS: The calibrated dating results (n = 27) 
      indicate that there existed two periods of occupation at the site, ~2500-2200 BC 
      and ~2200-1900 BC. Moderate high δ(15) N values were found in the crops. Isotopic 
      data from bone collagen suggest that the humans mainly relied on C(3) -based 
      animal protein and were supplemented by C(4) -based foods. This isotopic pattern 
      is also seen in pigs. Significant difference of human δ(13) C values 
      (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.05) between the two periods was observed. Compared to 
      the bones, the isotopic data of human dentine serial sections show a much wider 
      variability and higher δ(13) C values. DISCUSSION: The crops (millets and rice) 
      were probably manured. Human individuals subsisted on rice/millet agriculture and 
      pigs in general. In combination with the radiocarbon dates, the increase of C(3) 
      (rice) consumption by the humans was found from the early (2500-2200 cal. BC) to 
      late (2200-2000 cal. BC) periods, indicating the intensification of rice 
      agriculture through time. However, four categories of human life histories during 
      childhood are identified given different isotopic profiles of dentine sections, 
      demonstrating that C(3) (rice) and C(4) (millets)-based foods played different 
      roles in human lives. Even though, there were similar weaning practices among the 
      human populations. It is surprising that human individuals with dental ablation, 
      cultural characteristic in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River Valley, consumed 
      more millets during childhood in the early period than those without dental 
      ablation in the late period. Our study here provides novel insights into cultural 
      dynamics and the interplay between rice and millets in rice-millet agricultural 
      system during the Late Neolithic in Southwest China.

TI  - Effects of Non-native Fish on Lacustrine Food Web Structure and Mercury 
      Biomagnification along a Dissolved Organic Carbon Gradient.
PG  - 2196-2207
LID - 10.1002/etc.4831 [doi]
AB  - Although the introduction of non-native fish species has been shown to alter 
      trophic ecology in aquatic ecosystems, there has been limited research on how 
      invasive species alter methylmercury (MeHg) biomagnification in lacustrine food 
      webs. We sampled surface water and biota from 8 lakes in Quebec, Canada, spanning 
      a range of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (2.9-8.4 mg/L); 4 lakes 
      were inhabited by native brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), and the remaining 
      lakes contained brook trout and a non-native fish, Allegheny pearl dace 
      (Margariscus margarita). Periphyton, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates, and fish 
      were analyzed for: 1) stable carbon (δ(13) C) and nitrogen (δ(15) N) isotope 
      ratios to delineate food webs, and 2) total Hg (THg) or MeHg. Compared with the 
      brook trout from reference lakes, fish from invaded lakes had higher 
      length-standardized THg concentrations as well as a narrower dietary range and 
      elevated trophic level, inferred from unadjusted δ(13) C and δ(15) N values, 
      respectively. The rate of Hg biomagnification was similar across invaded and 
      reference lakes, implying little effect of the invasive fish on the trophic 
      transfer of MeHg. Despite differences in food web structure due to pearl dace 
      invasion, DOC was the strongest predictor of brook trout THg levels for all 
      lakes, suggesting that underlying environmental factors exerted a stronger 
      influence on brook trout THg concentrations than the presence of a non-native 
      forage fish. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;39:2196-2207. © 2020 SETAC.

TI  - Trophic level and basal resource use of soil animals are hardly affected by local 
      plant associations in abandoned arable land.
PG  - 8279-8288
LID - 10.1002/ece3.6535 [doi]
AB  - Plants provide resources and shape the habitat of soil organisms thereby 
      affecting the composition and functioning of soil communities. Effects of plants 
      on soil communities are largely taxon-dependent, but how different functional 
      groups of herbaceous plants affect trophic niches of individual animal species in 
      soil needs further investigation. Here, we studied the use of basal resources and 
      trophic levels of dominating soil meso- and macrofauna using stable isotope 
      ratios of carbon and nitrogen in arable fallow systems 3 and 14-16 years after 
      abandonment. Animals were sampled from the rhizosphere of three plant species of 
      different functional groups: a legume (Medicaco sativa), a nonlegume herb 
      (Taraxacum officinale), and a grass (Bromus sterilis). We found virtually no 
      consistent effects of plant identity on stable isotope composition of soil 
      animals and on thirteen isotopic metrics that reflect general food-web structure. 
      However, in old fallows, the carbon isotope composition of some predatory 
      macrofauna taxa had shifted closer to that of co-occurring plants, which was 
      particularly evident for Lasius, an aphid-associated ant genus. Trophic levels 
      and trophic-chain lengths in food webs were similar across plant species and 
      fallow ages. Overall, the results suggest that variations in local plant 
      diversity of grassland communities may little affect the basal resources and the 
      trophic level of prey consumed by individual species of meso- and macrofauna 
      belowground. By contrast, successional changes in grassland communities are 
      associated with shifts in the trophic niches of certain species, reflecting 
      establishment of trophic interactions with time, which shapes the functioning and 
      stability of soil food webs.

AB  - Benthic and pelagic food web components in Cumberland Sound, Canada were explored 
      as sources of total mercury (THg) to Greenland Sharks (Somniosus microcephalus) 
      via both bottom-up food web transfer and top-down shark feeding behavior. 
      Log10THg increased significantly with δ(15)N and trophic position from 
      invertebrates (0.01 ± 0.01 μg · g(-1) [113 ± 1 ng · g(-1)] dw in copepods) to 
      Greenland Sharks (3.54 ± 1.02 μg · g(-1)). The slope of the log10THg vs. δ(15)N 
      linear regression was higher for pelagic compared to benthic food web components 
      (excluding Greenland Sharks, which could not be assigned to either food web), 
      which resulted from THg concentrations being higher at the base of the benthic 
      food web (i.e., in benthic than pelagic primary consumers). However, feeding 
      habitat is unlikely to consistently influence shark THg exposure in Cumberland 
      Sound because THg concentrations did not consistently differ between benthic and 
      pelagic shark prey. Further, size, gender and feeding behavior (inferred from 
      stable isotopes and fatty acids) were unable to significantly explain THg 
      variability among individual Greenland Sharks. Possible reasons for this result 
      include: 1) individual sharks feeding as generalists, 2) high overlap in THg 
      among shark prey, and 3) differences in turnover time between ecological tracers 
      and THg. This first assessment of Greenland Shark THg within an Arctic food web 
      revealed high concentrations consistent with biomagnification, but low ability to 
      explain intra-specific THg variability. Our findings of high THg levels and 
      consumption of multiple prey types, however, suggest that Greenland Sharks 
      acquire THg through a variety of trophic pathways and are a significant 
      contributor to the total biotic THg pool in northern seas.

TI  - Differential reliance on aquatic prey subsidies influences mercury exposure in 
      riparian arachnids and songbirds.
PG  - 7003-7017

AB  - Cross-ecosystem subsidies move substantial amounts of nutrients between 
      ecosystems. Emergent aquatic insects are a particularly important prey source for 
      riparian songbirds but may also move aquatic contaminants, such as mercury (Hg), 
      to riparian food webs. While many studies focus on species that eat primarily 
      emergent aquatic insects, we instead study riparian songbirds with flexible 
      foraging strategies, exploiting both aquatic and terrestrial prey sources. The 
      goal in this study is to trace reliance on aquatic prey sources and correlate it 
      to Hg concentrations in common riparian arachnids (Families Tetragnathidae, 
      Opiliones, and Salticidae) and songbirds (Common Yellowthroat Geothlypis trichas, 
      Spotted Towhee Pipilo maculatus, Swainson's Thrush Catharus ustulatus, Song 
      Sparrow Melospiza melodia, and Yellow Warbler Setophaga petechia). We used stable 
      isotopes of δ(13)C and δ(15)N and Bayesian mixing models in MixSIAR to determine 
      the reliance of riparian predators on aquatic prey sources. Using mixed effects 
      models, we found that arachnid families varied in their reliance on aquatic prey 
      sources. While songbird species varied in their reliance on aquatic prey sources, 
      songbirds sampled earlier in the season consistently relied more on aquatic prey 
      sources than those sampled later in the season. For both arachnids and songbirds, 
      we found a positive correlation between the amount of the aquatic prey source in 
      their diet and their Hg concentrations. While the seasonal pulse of aquatic prey 
      to terrestrial ecosystems is an important source of nutrients to riparian 
      species, our results show that aquatic prey sources are linked with higher Hg 
      exposure. For songbirds, reliance on aquatic prey sources early in the breeding 
      season (and subsequent higher Hg exposure) coincides with timing of egg laying 
      and development, both of which may be impacted by Hg exposure.

AB  - Local and regional habitat conditions associated with agricultural activity can 
      fundamentally alter aquatic ecosystems. Increased nutrient inputs, channelization 
      and reduced riparian habitat both upstream and locally contribute to the 
      degradation of stream ecosystems and their function. Here, we examine stream food 
      webs in watersheds that feed into Lake Erie to determine the effects of 
      agricultural land cover on major food web energy pathways and trophic structure. 
      Given that higher agricultural intensity can increase nutrient runoff and reduce 
      the riparian zone and litter in-fall into streams, we predicted that generalist 
      fish would derive less energy from the terrestrial pathway and become more 
      omnivorous. Consistent with these predictions, we show that both mean terrestrial 
      energy use and trophic position of the resident top consumer, creek chub 
      (Semotilus atromaculatus), decrease with local agricultural intensity but not 
      with watershed-level agriculture intensity. These findings suggest that local 
      riparian buffers can maintain trophic structure even in the face of high 
      whole-watershed agricultural intensity.

LID - 10.1016/j.envpol.2021.116620 [doi]
AB  - Biomagnification of mercury (Hg) in the Scotia Sea food web of the Southern Ocean 
      was examined using the stable isotope ratios of nitrogen (δ(15)N) and carbon 
      (δ(13)C) as proxies for trophic level and feeding habitat, respectively. Total Hg 
      and stable isotopes were measured in samples of particulate organic matter (POM), 
      zooplankton, squid, myctophid fish, notothenioid fish and seabird tissues 
      collected in two years (austral summers 2007/08 and 2016/17). Overall, there was 
      extensive overlap in δ(13)C values across taxonomic groups suggesting 
      similarities in habitats, with the exception of the seabirds, which showed some 
      differences, possibly due to the type of tissue analysed (feathers instead of 
      muscle). δ(15)N showed increasing enrichment across groups in the order POM to 
      zooplankton to squid to myctophid fish to notothenioid fish to seabirds. There 
      were significant differences in δ(1)(5)N and δ(1)(3)C values among species within 
      taxonomic groups, reflecting inter-specific variation in diet. Hg concentrations 
      increased with trophic level, with the lowest values in POM 
      (0.0005 ± 0.0002 μg g(-1) dw) and highest values in seabirds 
      (3.88 ± 2.41 μg g(-1) in chicks of brown skuas Stercorarius antarcticus). Hg 
      concentrations tended to be lower in 2016/17 than in 2007/08 for mid-trophic 
      level species (squid and fish), but the opposite was found for top predators 
      (i.e. seabirds), which had higher levels in the 2016/17 samples. This may reflect 
      an interannual shift in the Scotia Sea marine food web, caused by the reduced 
      availability of a key prey species, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. In 
      2016/17, seabirds would have been forced to feed on higher trophic-level prey, 
      such as myctophids, that have higher Hg burdens. These results suggest that 
      changes in the food web are likely to affect the pathway of mercury to Southern 
      Ocean top predators.

AB  - The fossils preserved in the Rancho La Brea "tar" seeps in southern California 
      span the past ∼50,000 years and provide a rare opportunity to assess the ecology 
      of predators (e.g., the American lion, sabertooth cats, cougars, dire wolves, 
      gray wolves, and coyotes), including clarifying the causes and consequences of 
      the terminal Pleistocene extinction event. Here, a multi-proxy approach 
      elucidates dietary responses of carnivorans to changing climates and megafaunal 
      extinctions. Using sample sizes that are unavailable anywhere else in the world, 
      including hundreds of carnivoran and herbivore specimens, we clarify the 
      paleobiology of the extinct sabertooth cats and dire wolves-overturning the idea 
      that they heavily competed for similar prey. Canids (especially the dire wolf) 
      consumed prey from more open environments than felids, demonstrating minimal 
      competition for prey throughout the latest Pleistocene and largely irrespective 
      of changing climates, including just prior to their extinction. Coyotes 
      experienced a dramatic shift in dietary behavior toward increased carcass 
      utilization and the consumption of forest resources (prey and/or plant resources) 
      after the terminal Pleistocene megafaunal extinction. Extant predators' ability 
      to effectively hunt smaller prey and/or utilize carcasses may have been a key to 
      their survival, especially after a significant reduction in megafaunal prey 
      resources. Collectively, these data suggest that dietary niches of carnivorans 
      are not always static and can instead be substantially affected by the removal of 
      top predators and abundant prey resources.

AB  - Although pharmaceuticals are increasingly detected in abiotic matrices in the 
      Arctic, the accumulation of drugs in the resident biota and trophic transfer have 
      not been yet examined. This study investigated the behaviour of several 
      pharmaceuticals in the rocky-bottom, macrobenthic food web in the coastal zone of 
      Isfjorden (western Spitsbergen) using stable isotope analyses (SIA) coupled with 
      liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Across 16 macroalgal and 
      invertebrate species the highest average concentration was measured for 
      ciprofloxacin (CIP) (on average 60.3 ng g(-1) dw) followed by paracetamol (PCT) 
      (51.3 ng g(-1) dw) and nicotine (NIC) (37.8 ng g(-1) dw). The biomagnification 
      potential was assessed for six target compounds of 13 analytes detected that were 
      quantified with a frequency > 50 % in biological samples. The trophic 
      magnification factor (TMF) ranged between 0.3 and 2.8, and was significant for 
      NIC and CIP. TMF < 1.0 for NIC (0.3; confidence interval, CI 0.1-0.5) indicated 
      that the compound does not accumulate with trophic position. The dilution of 
      pharmaceutical residues in the food web may result from limited intake with 
      dietary route, poor assimilation efficiency and high biotransformation rates in 
      benthic invertebrates. TMF for CIP (2.8, CI 1.2-6.4) suggests trophic 
      magnification, a phenomenon observed previously for several antibiotics in 
      freshwater food webs. Trophic transfer therefore plays a role in controlling 
      concentration of CIP in the Arctic benthic communities and should be considered 
      in environmental risk assessment. Biomagnification potential of diclofenac (DIC; 
      0.9, CI 0.5-1.7), carbamazepine (CBZ; 0.4, CI 0.1-2.1), caffeine (CAF; 0.9, CI 
      0.5-1.9) and PCT (1.3, CI 0.7-2.7) was not evident due to large 95 % confidence 
      of their TMFs. This study provides the first evidence of drug bioaccumulation in 
      the Arctic food web and indicates that behaviour of pharmaceuticals varies among 
      target compounds.

TI  - Nearshore energy subsidies support Lake Michigan fishes and invertebrates 
      following major changes in food web structure.
PG  - 1243-52
AB  - Aquatic food webs that incorporate multiple energy channels (e.g., nearshore 
      benthic and pelagic) with varying productivity and turnover rates convey 
      stability to biological communities by providing independent energy sources. 
      Within the Lake Michigan food web, invasive dreissenid mussels have caused rapid 
      changes to food web structure and potentially altered the channels through which 
      consumers acquire energy. We used stable C and N isotopes to determine how Lake 
      Michigan food web structure has changed in the past decade, coincident with the 
      expansion of dreissenid mussels, decreased pelagic phytoplankton production, and 
      increased nearshore benthic algal production. Fish and invertebrate samples 
      collected from sites around Lake Michigan were analyzed to determine 
      taxa-specific 13C:12C (delta13C) and 15N:14N (delta15N) ratios. Sampling took 
      place during two distinct periods, 2002-2003 and 2010-2012, that spanned the 
      period of dreissenid expansion, and included nearshore, pelagic and profundal 
      fish and invertebrate taxa. The magnitude and direction of the delta13C shift 
      indicated significantly greater reliance upon nearshore benthic energy sources 
      among nearly all fish taxa as well as profundal invertebrates following 
      dreissenid expansion. Although the mechanisms underlying this delta13C shift 
      likely varied among species, possible causes include the transport of benthic 
      algal production to offshore waters and increased feeding on nearshore prey items 
      by pelagic and profundal species. delta15N shifts were more variable and of 
      smaller magnitude across taxa, although declines in delta15N among some pelagic 
      fishes suggest a shift to alternative prey resources. Lake Michigan fishes and 
      invertebrates appear to have responded to dreissenid-induced changes in nutrient 
      and energy pathways by switching from pelagic to alternative nearshore energy 
      subsidies. Although large shifts in energy allocation (i.e., pelagic to nearshore 
      benthic) resulting from invasive species appear to affect total production at 
      upper trophic levels, changes in trophic structure and utilization of novel 
      energy pathways may help to stabilize food webs following species invasions.

TI  - Fringes of the empire: Diet and cultural change at the Roman to post-Roman 
      transition in NW Iberia.
PG  - 141-54
LID - 10.1002/ajpa.23016 [doi]
AB  - A growing number of paleodiet investigations over recent years have begun to 
      reveal the stark dietary differences that existed between regions of the Roman 
      Empire, as well as significant changes in subsistence strategies after its fall. 
      The present study explores the dietary changes at the Roman to post-Roman 
      (Germanic) transition in the Northwest Iberian Peninsula, in order to improve our 
      understanding of the changes that occurred at end of the Roman Empire in 
      different regions across Europe and to also consider the influence of climate had 
      on them. The carbon and nitrogen stable isotope investigation in bone collagen 
      from A Lanzada, NW Spain (100-700 AD), which was an important commercial, coastal 
      settlement has been presented. A human sample of 59 individuals, 6 of them 
      subadults, is compared with 31 faunal specimens, which include a number of marine 
      fish. Isotope data for the terrestrial fauna reveal the influence of the sea on 
      the local isotope baseline. Analysis of the human samples indicates a mixed 
      marine-terrestrial diet. A shift in mean human δ(13) C values from -16.7‰ to 
      -14.3‰ provides clear evidence for a significant change in diet in the post-Roman 
      period, probably through the intensification of both marine resources 
      exploitation and C4 -plant consumption (presumably millet). A deterioration of 
      paleoenvironmental conditions, together with a poor socioeconomic situation and 
      the arrival of new people, the Sueves, who brought a new political and 
      socioeconomic system have been discussed as the main causes for the dietary 
      modification in post-Roman times.

TI  - Stable isotopes reveal overlooked incorporation of diffuse land-based sources of

AB  - Rapa Nui is an important hotspot of endemic marine biodiversity, where diffuse 
      land-based sources (e.g., nutrients and organic matter) entering into coastal 
      waters could develop eutrophication in coastal environments, with deleterious 
      impacts on the marine ecosystem. Stable isotopes (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) of 
      intertidal communities (macroalgae and invertebrates) were studied from sites 
      with contrasting human influence (populated and unpopulated), to evaluate the 
      incorporation and transfer of diffuse land-based sources through food webs. 
      Macroalgae showed differences between some sites, and invertebrates showed a 
      (15)N-enrichment pattern at populated areas relative to unpopulated, being these 
      differences significant in gastropods, barnacles and sea urchins. Moreover, 
      trophic structure metrics suggest a higher trophic diversity in populated areas 
      relative to unpopulated and support the isotopic partitioning between sites, 
      associated with the incorporation of sources with (15)N-enriched values. The 
      above suggests that diffuse land-based sources could be incorporated by 
      macroalgae, transferred into benthic consumers, and altering the trophic 
      structure.

TI  - Back to the future? Late Holocene marine food web structure in a warm climatic 
      phase as a predictor of trophodynamics in a warmer South-Western Atlantic Ocean.
PG  - 404-419
LID - 10.1111/gcb.14523 [doi]
AB  - Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in the skeletal elements of both 
      ancient and modern marine species from the Beagle Channel were used to compare 
      the structure of Late Holocene and modern food webs, and predict potential 
      changes as a result of a Sea Surface Temperature (SST) increase in the region. 
      Complementary, ancient and modern shells of limpets and mussels were isotopically 
      analysed to explore changes in the isotopic baseline and compare marine food webs 
      through time after an appropriate correction for baseline shifts. Results 
      confirmed a declining pattern of marine primary productivity during the Late 
      Holocene in the Beagle Channel. In general, the isotopic niches overlapped 
      largely in the ancient food web in comparison to the current marine one, with the 
      exception of that of cormorants (Phalacrocorax sp.). Our data suggest that all 
      the species that have undergone intense human exploitation (Arctocephalus 
      australis, Otaria flavescens and Merluccius sp.) significantly increased their 
      trophic levels. The most important finding of this work was the very high 
      isotopic overlap between snoek (Thyrsites atun) and hake (Merluccius sp.) during 
      the Late Holocene. Increasing SST as a result of global warming could favour the 
      recolonization of the southern South-Western Atlantic Ocean by snoek from the 
      South-Eastern Pacific Ocean, with a potential impact on the landings of the 
      economically important Argentine and Austral hake. These findings highlight the 
      relevance of using zooarchaeological remains for providing predictions about 
      marine food webs changes in the near future.

TI  - Size compartmentalization of energy channeling in terrestrial belowground food 
      webs.
PG  - e03421
LID - 10.1002/ecy.3421 [doi]
AB  - Size-structured food webs form integrated trophic systems where energy is 
      channeled from small to large consumers. Empirical evidence suggests that size 
      structure prevails in aquatic ecosystems, whereas in terrestrial food webs 
      trophic position is largely independent of body size. Compartmentalization of 
      energy channeling according to size classes of consumers was suggested as a 
      mechanism that underpins functioning and stability of terrestrial food webs 
      including those belowground, but their structure has not been empirically 
      assessed across the whole size spectrum. Here we used stable isotope analysis and 
      metabolic regressions to describe size structure and energy use in eight 
      belowground communities with consumers spanning 12 orders of magnitude in living 
      body mass, from protists to earthworms. We showed a negative correlation between 
      trophic position and body mass in invertebrate communities and a remarkable 
      nonlinearity in community metabolism and trophic positions across all size 
      classes. Specifically, we found that the correlation between body mass and 
      trophic level is positive in the small-sized (protists, nematodes, arthropods 
      below 1 μg in body mass), neutral in the medium-sized (arthropods of 1 μg to 
      1 mg), and negative in the large-sized consumers (large arthropods, earthworms), 
      suggesting that these groups form compartments with different trophic 
      organization. Based on this pattern, we propose a concept of belowground food 
      webs being composed of (1) size-structured micro-food web driving fast energy 
      channeling and nutrient release, for example in microbial loop; (2) arthropod 
      macro-food web with no clear correlation between body size and trophic level, 
      hosting soil arthropod diversity and subsidizing aboveground predators; and (3) 
      "trophic whales," sequestering energy in their large bodies and restricting its 
      propagation to higher trophic levels in belowground food webs. The three size 
      compartments are based on a similar set of basal resources, but contribute to 
      different ecosystem-level functions and respond differently to variations in 
      climate, soil characteristics and land use. We suggest that the widely used 
      vision of resource-based energy channeling in belowground food webs can be 
      complemented with size-based energy channeling, where ecosystem 
      multifunctionality, biodiversity, and stability are supported by a balance across 
      individual size compartments.

TI  - Broad shifts in the resource use of a commercially harvested fish following the 
      invasion of dreissenid mussels.
PG  - 1681-1692
LID - 10.1002/ecy.1836 [doi]
AB  - Dreissenid mussels, including the zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga 
      (Dreissena rostiformus bugensis) mussel, are invasive species known for their 
      capacity to act as ecosystem engineers. They have caused significant changes in 
      the many freshwater systems they have invaded by increasing water clarity, 
      reducing primary productivity, and altering zooplankton and benthic invertebrate 
      assemblages. What is less clear is how their ecosystem engineering effects 
      manifest up the food web to impact higher trophic levels, including fish. Here, 
      we use a biological tracer (stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen) to analyze 
      long-term and broad-scale trends in the resource use of benthivorous lake 
      whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) in the Laurentian Great Lakes, where 
      dreissenid mussels have become established in each lake except Lake Superior. We 
      measured stable isotope ratios from archived material (fish scale samples) 
      collected over several decades by multiple agencies and from 14 locations around 
      the Great Lakes. In the majority of locations, the δ(13) C of lake whitefish 
      increased following the establishment of dreissenid mussels. Trends in δ(15) N 
      were less clear, but significant breakpoints in the time series occurred within 
      5 yr of dreissenid establishment in several locations, followed by declines in 
      δ(15) N. In contrast, isotopic signatures in Lake Superior locations did not show 
      these trends. Our results provide evidence that lake whitefish shifted toward 
      greater reliance on nearshore benthic production, supporting the theory that 
      fundamental energy pathways are changed when dreissenid mussels become 
      established. Importantly, these effects were noted across multiple, large, and 
      complex ecosystems spanning a broad geographic area. Our study underscores the 
      potential for aquatic invasive species to alter key ecosystem services as 
      demonstrated here through their impacts on energy pathways supporting a 
      commercially harvested fish species.

AB  - We examined trophic relationships in a newly established community 1.5 years 
      after the Hebei Spirit oil spill on the west coast of Korea. Carbon and nitrogen 
      stable isotope ratios in consumers and their potential food sources were compared 
      between the oil-spill site and reference site, located 13.5 km from the oil-spill 
      spot. The isotopic mixing model and a novel circular statistics rejected the 
      influx of petrogenic carbon into the community and identified spatial 
      consistencies such as the high contributions of microphytobenthos, food-chain 
      length, and the isotopic niche of each feeding guild between sites. We suggested 
      that high level of trophic plasticity and the prevalence of omnivory of consumers 
      may promote the robustness of food web against the oil contamination. 
      Furthermore, we highlighted the need of holistic approaches including different 
      functional groups to quantify changes in the food web structure and assess the 
      influence of different perturbations including oil spill.

TI  - New insights into the trophic ecology of blacktip sharks (Carcharhinus limbatus) 
      from a subtropical estuary in the western Gulf of Mexico.
PG  - 470-484
LID - 10.1111/jfb.14592 [doi]
AB  - As environmental change persists, understanding resource use patterns is of value 
      to predict the consequences of shifting trophic structures. While many sharks are 
      opportunistic predators, some exhibit prey selectivity, putting them at higher 
      risk compared to species with greater trophic plasticity. In the Gulf of Mexico 
      (GOM), Clupeids and Sciaenids comprise 69% of blacktip shark (Carcharhinus 
      limbatus) diets, which is consequential considering potential responses of these 
      prey groups to disturbance and over harvesting. We assessed if blacktips exhibit 
      selectivity for Clupeids and Sciaenids in the western GOM based on stomach 
      contents from sharks in coastal Texas. Clupeids comprised <2% of diets, while 
      striped mullet (Mugil cephalus) and red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) comprised >70% 
      of identifiable prey. Ontogenetic shifts from smaller (Clupeids, small Sciaenids) 
      to larger, higher trophic level (Ariidae, Elasmobranchii) prey fits our 
      understanding of foraging among coastal sharks, and suggests our regional 
      understanding of blacktip trophic ecology may be limited by the sizes of sampled 
      sharks. Observed increases in blacktip densities coupled with declines in prey 
      (Mugilids, Sciaenids) is concerning if blacktips have limited diet plasticity. 
      Yet GOM blacktips may be more generalized than previously thought, which is 
      promising for conservation and management.

      approach.
PG  - 5058-65
LID - 10.1021/es404159k [doi]
AB  - Mercury is a widespread contaminant in marine food webs, and identifying uptake 
      pathways of mercury species, CH3Hg(+) and Hg(2+), into low trophic level 
      organisms is important to understanding its entry into marine food webs. Enriched 
      stable isotope tracers were used to study benthic vs. pelagic pathways of 
      CH3Hg(+) and Hg(2+) uptake via food to the infaunal estuarine amphipod, 
      Leptocheirus plumulosus. Algal cells differentially labeled with isotopically 
      enriched CH3Hg(+) or Hg(2+) were added simultaneously to the sediment and water 
      column of microcosms, and Hg species were monitored in amphipods and in sediment 
      and water compartments. Methylation of Hg(2+) occurred during the course of the 
      experiment, enhancing the uptake of Hg(2+) spikes. Trophic transfer of Hg from 
      algae added to the water column was determined to be the major uptake route for 
      amphipods, suggesting inputs of contaminated organic matter from the pelagic zone 
      are important to mercury bioaccumulation even in organisms living in sediments.

AB  - Resource availability and flooding disturbance restrict the amount of energy 
      available to the upper trophic level consumers and thus determine the trophic 
      structure and energy mobilization in river food webs. In this study, we evaluated 
      the availability of primary and secondary food resources, food web structure 
      (determined by δ(13)C and δ(15)N) and relative contributions of autochthonous and 
      allochthonous particulate carbon to aquatic consumers in the Irtysh River, which 
      spans from northwest China to Kazakhstan and suffers from a long frozen period. 
      Despite higher density and biomass, epilithic algae did not make large 
      contributions to aquatic consumers due to the restriction of flow velocity, water 
      depth and turbidity. Aquatic invertebrates specialized in utilization of 
      terrestrial carbon sources, whereas fish varied from aquatic to riparian plants. 
      Different resource use of aquatic consumers across the three reaches in the 
      Irtysh River was ascribed to the spatial distribution of species and resource 
      availability determined by flooding, flood scouring and dam construction. The 
      trophic positions and food chain length at the upper reach were higher than those 
      at the middle and lower reaches. These findings suggest that allochthonous carbon 
      had an advantage over autochthonous carbon in supporting aquatic food webs of the 
      Irtysh River. Higher availability of allochthonous particulate carbon might be 
      relevant to intensive forest cover and high energy flood events in the Irtysh 
      River.

AB  - The indigenous microorganisms with the ability of metabolising di-(2-ethylhexyl) 
      phthalate (DEHP) in agricultural soils and their interactions with non-degrading 
      microbes were revealed by DNA-based stable isotope probing coupled with molecular 
      ecological network. Aside from the previously reported DEHP degraders (family 
      Planococcaceae and genus Sphingobacterium), five OTUs representing bacteria 
      affiliated with genus Brevundimona, class Spartobacteria, genus Singulisphaera, 
      genus Dyella and class Ktedonobacteria were linked with DEHP biodegradation. The 
      analysis of the constructed ecological network based on soil microbial 
      communities demonstrated the negative relationships between DEHP degraders and 
      the dominant family Oxalobacteraceae in soils. Additionally, two cultivable 
      bacteria isolated from the same soils, Rhizobium-1 and Ensifer-1, had strong 
      capabilities in degrading DEHP but their involvement in in situ DEHP degradation 
      was questioned, as their DNA was not labelled with (13)C from DEHP. These 
      findings provide deeper understanding on the indigenous DEHP-degrading 
      communities and will benefit the remediation of phthalate esters contaminated 
      soils.

AB  - Eutrophication due to excessive nutrient inputs is a major threat to coastal 
      ecosystems worldwide, causing harmful algae blooms, seagrass loss and hypoxia. 
      Decisions to combat eutrophication in the North Sea were made in the 1980s. 
      Despite significant improvements during recent decades, high nitrogen loads and 
      resulting eutrophication problems remain. In this study, long-term changes in 
      nitrogen inputs to the Elbe Estuary (Germany) were characterized based on 
      nitrogen data provided by the Elbe River Basin Community from 1985 to 2019. 
      Additionally, surface water samples were taken at the weir separating the river 
      from the estuary from 2011 to 2021 to characterize dissolved inorganic nitrogen 
      concentrations and nitrate stable isotope composition. The findings suggest a 
      close coupling of river discharge with the riverine nitrogen cycle. Nitrogen 
      loads decreased disproportionately with decreasing discharge. This decrease is 
      due to intensified nitrogen retention in the Elbe catchment, which can double 
      nitrogen retention compared to average discharge conditions. Phytoplankton growth 
      was enhanced by long residence times and high light availability at low water 
      levels. This suggests that the recent decreases in nitrogen loads in the Elbe 
      River were not only a result of management measures in the catchment but were 
      also amplified by a recent long-lasting drought in the catchment. Based on 
      projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, more frequent and 
      extensive droughts are anticipated, which may lead to future seasonal shifts to 
      nitrate limitation in the lower Elbe River.

TI  - Does trawl fisheries affect the diet of fishes? A stable isotope analysis 
      approach().

AB  - Trawling is the main fishing practice worldwide and its ecosystem effects have 
      been raising concern over the past decades. Long-term impacts can be monitored 
      through changes in the trophic structure, and several studies evaluated trophic 
      level (TL) shifts in fish populations between trawled and untrawled environments. 
      However, published results are contrasting. We performed a metanalysis 
      integrating all available studies that evaluated TL shifts in fishes between 
      trawled and untrawled environments and conducted a local study comparing several 
      features of the trophic ecology in two species of fishes. According to the 
      metanalysis, TL does not change significantly with trawling. In contrast, the 
      local study showed higher TLs and broader isotopic niches in the trawled 
      environment. Diet reconstruction indicated a potential consumption of hake, the 
      main discard component, at the trawled environment. All the studies used in the 
      metanalysis were conducted in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas the local study 
      represents the first data available from the Southern Hemisphere. As industrial 
      commercial fisheries in Argentina are relatively recent, it is possible that our 
      data are capturing the initial stage of ecological changes induced by trawling, 
      compared with the historical fisheries located at the Northern Hemisphere.

TI  - Quantitative approaches to the analysis of stable isotope food web data.
PG  - 2793-802
AB  - Ecologists use stable isotopes (delta13C, delta15N) to better understand food 
      webs and explore trophic interactions in ecosystems. Traditionally, delta13C vs. 
      delta15N bi-plots have been used to describe food web structure for a single time 
      period or ecosystem. Comparisons of food webs across time and space are 
      increasing, but development of statistical approaches for testing hypotheses 
      regarding food web change has lagged behind. Here we present statistical 
      methodologies for quantitatively comparing stable isotope food web data. We 
      demonstrate the utility of circular statistics and hypothesis tests for 
      quantifying directional food web differences using two case studies: an arthropod 
      salt marsh community across a habitat gradient and a freshwater fish community 
      from Lake Tahoe, USA, over a 120-year time period. We calculated magnitude and 
      mean angle of change (theta) for each species in food web space using mean 
      delta13C and delta15N of each species as the x, y coordinates. In the coastal 
      salt marsh, arthropod consumers exhibited a significant shift toward dependence 
      on Spartina, progressing from a habitat invaded by Phragmites to a restored 
      Spartina habitat. In Lake Tahoe, we found that all species from the freshwater 
      fish community shifted in the same direction in food web space toward more 
      pelagic-based production with the introduction of nonnative Mysis relicta and 
      onset of cultural eutrophication. Using circular statistics to quantitatively 
      analyze stable isotope food web data, we were able to gain significant insight 
      into patterns and changes in food web structure that were not evident from 
      qualitative comparisons. As more ecologists incorporate a food web perspective 
      into ecosystem analysis, these statistical tools can provide a basis for 
      quantifying directional food web differences from standard isotope data.

AB  - Emerging aquatic insects are important vectors of contaminant transfer from 
      aquatic to terrestrial food webs. However, the environmental factors that 
      regulate contaminant body burdens in nearshore terrestrial consumers remain 
      largely unexplored. We investigated the relative influences of riparian landscape 
      composition (i.e., land use and nearshore vegetation structure) and contaminant 
      flux via the emergent aquatic insect subsidy on selenium (Se) and mercury (Hg) 
      body burdens of riparian ants (Formica subsericea) and spiders of the family 
      Tetragnathidae along 11 river reaches spanning an urban-rural land-use gradient 
      in Ohio, USA. Model-selection results indicated that fine-scale land cover (e.g., 
      riparian zone width, shrub cover) in the riparian zone was positively associated 
      with reach-wide body burdens of Se and Hg in both riparian F. subsericea and 
      tetragnathid spiders (i.e., total magnitude of Hg and Se concentrations in ant 
      and spider populations, respectively, for each reach). River distance downstream 
      of Columbus, Ohio - where study reaches were impounded and flow through a large 
      urban center - was also implicated as an important factor. Although 
      stable-isotope analysis suggested that emergent aquatic insects were likely 
      vectors of Se and Hg to tetragnathid spiders (but not to F. subsericea), emergent 
      insect contaminant flux did not emerge as a significant predictor for either 
      reach-wide body burdens of spider Hg or Se. Improved understanding of the 
      pathways and influences that control aquatic-to-terrestrial contaminant transport 
      will be critical for effective risk management and remediation.

TI  - Changes in herbivore control in arable fields by detrital subsidies depend on 
      predator species and vary in space.
PG  - 1033-42
LID - 10.1007/s00442-010-1604-6 [doi]
AB  - Prey from the decomposer subsystem may help sustain predator populations in 
      arable fields. Adding organic residues to agricultural systems may therefore 
      enhance pest control. We investigated whether resource addition (maize mulch) 
      strengthens aboveground trophic cascades in winter wheat fields. Evaluating the 
      flux of the maize-borne carbon into the food web after 9 months via stable 
      isotope analysis allowed differentiating between prey in predator diets 
      originating from the above- and belowground subsystems. Furthermore, we recorded 
      aphid populations in predator-reduced and control plots of no-mulch and mulch 
      addition treatments. All analyzed soil dwelling species incorporated maize-borne 
      carbon. In contrast, only 2 out of 13 aboveground predator species incorporated 
      maize carbon, suggesting that these 2 predators forage on prey from the above- 
      and belowground systems. Supporting this conclusion, densities of these two 
      predator species were increased in the mulch addition fields. Nitrogen isotope 
      signatures suggested that these generalist predators in part fed on Collembola 
      thereby benefiting indirectly from detrital resources. Increased density of these 
      two predator species was associated by increased aphid control but the identity 
      of predators responsible for aphid control varied in space. One of the three 
      wheat fields studied even lacked aphid control despite of mulch-mediated 
      increased density of generalist predators. The results suggest that detrital 
      subsidies quickly enter belowground food webs but only a few aboveground predator 
      species include prey out of the decomposer system into their diet. Variation in 
      the identity of predator species benefiting from detrital resources between sites 
      suggest that, depending on locality, different predator species are subsidised by 
      prey out of the decomposer system and that these predators contribute to aphid 
      control. Therefore, by engineering the decomposer subsystem via detrital 
      subsidies, biological control by generalist predators may be strengthened.

AB  - Waterbirds can reallocate a considerable amount of nutrients within agricultural 
      fields and between agriculture sites and wetlands. However their effects on 
      biogeochemical cycles have rarely been quantified. We estimated bird numbers, 
      diet (from stable isotope analysis), food supply, and the food consumption on 
      rice fields by overwintering waterbirds in one of the most important areas for 
      rice production in southwestern Europe and a key area for various migrating and 
      resident waterbird species. Herein, we modelled the nutrient (N and P) recycling 
      in rice fields, and their transport to reservoirs. The energy consumption by 
      waterbirds (96,605±18,311 individuals) on rice fields during winter averaged at 
      89.9±39.0 kJ·m(-2), with its majority (89.9%) belonging to foraging on rice 
      seeds. Thus, the birds removed about 26% of rice seeds leftover after harvest 
      (estimated in 932.5±504.7 seeds·m(-2) in early winter) wherein common cranes and 
      dabbling ducks (four species) were the most important consumers. Waterbirds 
      foraging and roosting in the rice fields recycled more than 24.1 (1.0 kg·ha(-1)) 
      of N and an additional 5.0 tons (0.2 kg·ha(-1)) of P in the Extremadura's rice 
      fields during winter. Additionally, we estimated that 2.3 tons of N and 550 kg of 
      P were removed from rice fields and transported to reservoirs. The seasonal 
      foraging of wildlife should result in a direct benefit for rice farmers by 
      improving nutrient recycling through defecation by waterbirds with respect to 
      artificial fertilisation. Additionally, rice fields located in the cranes' core 
      wintering areas can provide sufficient food supply to induce habitat shift from 
      their traditional wintering habitat in 'dehesas' to rice fields, which causes 
      indirect socioeconomic benefit through reduced acorn consumption by cranes. Our 
      modelling approach may thus be especially helpful for management decisions 
      regarding rice agroecosystems in areas which are also important for the 
      conservation of migratory waterbirds.

TI  - Detection of terrigenous and marine organic matter flow into a eutrophic

AB  - The pathways of terrigenous and marine organic matter originating into Daya Bay 
      intertidal habitats were investigated using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope 
      analyses. Spatiotemporal (sites, seasons and tidal levels) variations in isotopic 
      ratios of basal food sources and macrobenthic consumers, and also the 
      contribution of sources to the diet of representative species and the whole 
      macrobenthic biomass were estimated using Isosource mixing model. Results showed 
      the anthropogenic impacts on benthic and pelagic organic matter as well as 
      macrobenthos, depending on the spatial and temporal scales. Macrobenthic trophic 
      structure was affected by mariculture and nuclear power plants in the dry season 
      (winter), and the allochthonous sources i.e. industrial and urban sewage in flood 
      season (summer). Microphytobenthos dominated the sediment organic matter pool and 
      macrobenthic diet, while the trophic importance of mangrove leaf litter for 
      intertidal macrobenthic communities was low. However, mangroves showed their 
      indirect effects on the variations in macrobenthic trophic function across tidal 
      levels. The isotopic ratios of benthic food sources and common taxa varied 
      significantly among the tidal levels of the mangrove-lined ecosystem. In 
      addition, pooling the macrobenthic taxa based on their feeding guild and also 
      biomass confirmed the causes and effects for variations in organic matter 
      composition and flow indicated by representative species in the study area. 
      Therefore, using feeding guild and biomass as the indicators of the macrobenthic 
      trophic function is suggested as well as the tidal level spatial scale in the 
      heterogeneous intertidal ecosystems for data analyses and sampling design of 
      intertidal macrobenthic food web modeling.

TI  - Svalbard reindeer winter diets: Long-term dietary shifts to graminoids in 
      response to a changing climate.
PG  - 7009-7022
LID - 10.1111/gcb.16420 [doi]
AB  - Arctic ecosystems are changing dramatically with warmer and wetter conditions 
      resulting in complex interactions between herbivores and their forage. We 
      investigated how Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) modify their 
      late winter diets in response to long-term trends and interannual variation in 
      forage availability and accessibility. By reconstructing their diets and foraging 
      niches over a 17-year period (1995-2012) using serum δ(13) C and δ(15) N values, 
      we found strong support for a temporal increase in the proportions of graminoids 
      in the diets with a concurrent decline in the contributions of mosses. This 
      dietary shift corresponds with graminoid abundance increases in the region and 
      was associated with increases in population density, warmer summer temperatures 
      and more frequent rain-on-snow (ROS) in winter. In addition, the variance in 
      isotopic niche positions, breadths, and overlaps also supported a temporal shift 
      in the foraging niche and a dietary response to extreme ROS events. Our long-term 
      study highlights the mechanisms by which winter and summer climate changes 
      cascade through vegetation shifts and herbivore population dynamics to alter the 
      foraging niche of Svalbard reindeer. Although it has been anticipated that 
      climate changes in the Svalbard region of the Arctic would be detrimental to this 
      unique ungulate, our study suggests that environmental change is in a phase where 
      conditions are improving for this subspecies at the northernmost edge of the 
      Rangifer distribution.

AB  - While the importance of terrestrial linkages to aquatic ecosystems is well 
      appreciated, the degree of terrestrial support of aquatic consumers remains 
      debated. Estimates of terrestrial contributions to lake zooplankton have omitted 
      a key food source, phytoplankton produced below the mixed layer. We used carbon 
      and nitrogen stable isotope data from 25 Pacific Northwest lakes to assess the 
      relative importance of particulate organic matter (POM) from the mixed layer, 
      below the mixed layer and terrestrial detritus to zooplankton. Zooplankton and 
      deep POM were depleted in ¹³C relative to mixed layer POM in lakes that can 
      support deep primary production. A Bayesian stable isotope mixing model estimated 
      that terrestrial detritus contributed <5% to zooplankton production, and confirms 
      the role of lake optical and thermal properties; deep POM accounted for up to 80% 
      of zooplankton production in the clearest lakes. These results suggest 
      terrestrial support of lake zooplankton production is trivial.

TI  - Experimentally derived trophic enrichment and discrimination factors for Chinook 
      salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha.
PG  - e9092
LID - 10.1002/rcm.9092 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Stable isotope analysis (SIA) can provide important insights into food 
      web structure and is a widely used tool in ecological conservation and 
      management. It has recently been augmented by compound-specific stable isotope 
      analysis of amino acids (CSIA-AA), an innovation that can provide greater 
      precision when analyzing trophic level and food web connectivity. The utility of 
      SIA rests on confidence in its constituent parameters such as the trophic 
      enrichment factor (TEF). There is increasing emphasis on the need to 
      experimentally derive species and tissue specific TEFs for studies utilizing SIA. 
      Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, is a species with high potential for 
      study using SIA due to the difficulty in observing its ecology during its marine 
      phase and the significance of the conservation consequences of recent population 
      declines. METHODS: Bulk and amino acid-specific TEFs were determined for juvenile 
      and adult Chinook salmon fed specific diets. Three controlled feeding studies 
      were performed: adult salmon were fed a biofeed, juvenile salmon were fed a 
      biofeed, and juvenile salmon were fed krill. Bulk and compound-specific stable 
      isotope data were collected from diet samples and from salmon muscle tissue after 
      a minimum of 8 weeks of controlled feeding. Bulk isotope signatures were measured 
      using EA-IRMS and CSIA-AA signatures using GC/C-IRMS, allowing the TEFs to be 
      calculated. RESULTS: The bulk isotope TEFs were higher than those predicted for 
      similar marine organisms and averaged 3.5‰ for ∆(15) N and 1.3‰ for ∆(13) C. The 
      TEFs derived for nitrogen isotopes of amino acids were in line with expectations 
      for this approach: the mean value for ∆(15) N(Glu)  - ∆(15) N(Phe) was 7.06‰ and, 
      using a multi-AA approach, the value for ∆(15) N(Trophic)  - ∆(15) N(Source) was 
      6.67‰. For carbon isotopes of amino acids, the derived TEFs of Iso, Leu and Phe 
      were near 0‰, as was that of Met, supporting their use of as source amino acids 
      in future CSIA studies. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents Chinook salmon-specific 
      TEFs for bulk and amino acid SIA. It supports the application of future research 
      applying SIA to the study of Chinook salmon and validates previous research on 
      species-specific TEFs.

AB  - The Yangtze River, the largest river in Asia, plays a crucial role in linking 
      continental and oceanic ecosystems. However, the impact of natural and 
      anthropogenic disturbances on composition and transformation of dissolved organic 
      matter (DOM) during long-distance transport and seasonal cycle is not fully 
      understood. By using a combination of elemental, isotopic and optical techniques, 
      as well as Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR 
      MS), we investigated DOM abundance and composition along the whole mainstream at 
      highly spatial resolution in the dry and early wet seasons. Our findings showed 
      that the concentration and flux of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the Yangtze 
      River was much lower compared with other worldwide larger rivers. The 
      distribution of δ(13)C(DOC) and higher abundance of humic-like fluorescent 
      component and highly unsaturated and phenolics (HUPs) compound reflected a 
      prominent contribution of allochthonous DOM. Further optical and molecular 
      analysis revealed humic-like fluorescent components were coupled with CHO 
      molecules and HUPs compound with higher aromatic, unsaturated, molecular weight 
      and stable characteristics between upstream and midstream reaches. With 
      increasing agricultural and urban land downstream, there were more heteroatomic 
      formulae and labile aliphatic and protein-like compounds which were derived from 
      human activities and in situ primary production. Meanwhile, DOM gradually 
      accumulates with slow water flow and additional autochthonous organics. Weaker 
      solar radiation and water dilution during the dry/cold season favours highly 
      aromatic, unsaturated and oxygenated DOM compositions. Conversely, higher 
      discharge during the wet/warm season diluted the terrestrial DOM, but warm 
      temperatures could promote phytoplankton growth that releases labile aliphatic 
      and protein-like DOM. Besides, chemical sulfurization, hydrogenation and 
      oxygenation were found during molecular cycling processes. Our research 
      emphasizes the active response of riverine DOM to natural and anthropogenic 
      controls, and provides a valuable preliminary background to better understand the 
      biogeochemical cycling of DOM in a larger river.

AB  - Seasonal variation in mercury (Hg) concentrations and food web structure was 
      assessed for eastern Lake Ontario. Hg concentrations, measured in 6 species of 
      invertebrates and 8 species of fishes, tended to be highest in the spring and 
      lowest in the summer for most biota. Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) exhibited 
      significant ontogenetic shifts in diet and Hg, although such patterns were not 
      evident for other species. Food web structure, as indicated by stable isotope 
      values (δ(15)N, δ(13)C) was not static. Log-transformed Hg data were strongly and 
      consistently correlated with δ(15)N values for the whole food web in each of the 
      three seasons (slopes, 0.17-0.24) and across the entire year (slope, 0.2). While 
      significantly different between seasons, the regression slope values are still 
      consistent with published global Hg biomagnification rates. Our results indicate 
      that the assessment of Hg trends in Great Lakes must take into account seasonal 
      patterns and time of sampling.

AB  - Diets of species are crucial in determining how they influence food webs and 
      community structures, and how their populations are regulated by different 
      bottom-up processes. Omnivores are able to adjust their diet flexibly according 
      to environmental conditions, such that their impacts on food webs and 
      communities, and the macronutrients constraining their population, can be 
      plastic. In particular, omnivore diets are known to be influenced by prey 
      availability, which exhibits high spatial and temporal variation. To examine the 
      plasticity of diet and macronutrient limitation in omnivores, we compared trophic 
      positions, macronutrient preferences and food exploitation rates of omnivorous 
      ants in invertebrate-rich (secondary forests) and invertebrate-poor (Lophostemon 
      confertus plantations) habitats. We hypothesized that omnivorous ants would have 
      lower trophic positions, enhanced protein limitation and reduced food 
      exploitation rates in L. confertus plantations relative to secondary forests. We 
      performed cafeteria experiments to examine changes in macronutrient limitation 
      and food exploitation rates. We also sampled ants and conducted stable isotope 
      analyses to investigate dietary shifts between these habitats. We found that 
      conspecific ants were less carnivorous and had higher preferences for 
      protein-rich food in L. confertus plantations compared to secondary forests. 
      However, ant assemblages did not exhibit increased preferences for protein-rich 
      food in L. confertus plantations. At the species-level, food exploitation rates 
      varied idiosyncratically between habitats. At the assemblage-level, food 
      exploitation rates were reduced in L. confertus plantations. Our results reveal 
      that plantation establishments alter the diet and foraging behaviour of 
      omnivorous ants. Such changes suggest that omnivorous ants in plantations will 
      have reduced top-down impacts on prey communities but also see an increased 
      importance of protein as a bottom-up force in constraining omnivore population 
      sizes.

AB  - Mixotrophy is among the most successful nutritional strategies in terrestrial and 
      marine ecosystems. The ability of organisms to supplement primary nutritional 
      modes along continua of autotrophy and heterotrophy fosters trophic flexibility 
      that can sustain metabolic demands under variable or stressful conditions. 
      Symbiotic, reef-building corals are among the most broadly distributed and 
      ecologically important mixotrophs, yet we lack a basic understanding of how they 
      modify their use of autotrophy and heterotrophy across gradients of food 
      availability. Here, we evaluate how one coral species, Pocillopora meandrina, 
      supplements autotrophic nutrition through heterotrophy within an archipelago and 
      test whether this pattern holds across species globally. Using stable isotope 
      analysis (δ(13)C) and satellite-derived estimates of nearshore primary production 
      (chlorophyll-a, as a proxy for food availability), we show that P. meandrina 
      incorporates a greater proportion of carbon via heterotrophy when more food is 
      available across five central Pacific islands. We then show that this pattern is 
      consistent globally using data from 15 coral species across 16 locations spanning 
      the Caribbean Sea and the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Globally, surface 
      chlorophyll-a explains 77% of the variation in coral heterotrophic nutrition, 86% 
      for one genus across 10 islands, and 94% when controlling for coral taxonomy 
      within archipelagos. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that 
      satellite-derived estimates of nearshore primary production provide a globally 
      relevant proxy for resource availability that can explain variation in coral 
      trophic ecology. Thus, our model provides a pivotal step toward resolving the 
      biophysical couplings between mixotrophic organisms and spatial patterns of 
      resource availability in the coastal oceans.

AB  - Invasions are ecologically destructive and can threaten biodiversity. Trophic 
      flexibility has been proposed as a mechanism facilitating invasion, with more 
      flexible species better able to invade. The termite hunting needle ant 
      Brachyponera chinensis was introduced from East Asia to the United States where 
      it disrupts native ecosystems. We show that B. chinensis has expanded dietary 
      breadth without shifting trophic position in its introduced range. Transect 
      sampling of ants and termites revealed a negative correlation between the 
      abundance of B. chinensis and the abundance of other ants in introduced 
      populations, but this pattern was not as strong in the native range. Both termite 
      and B. chinensis abundance were higher in the introduced range than in native 
      range. Radiocarbon ((14)C) analysis revealed that B. chinensis has significantly 
      younger 'diet age', the time lag between carbon fixation by photosynthesis and 
      its use by the consumer, in the introduced range than in the native range, while 
      stable isotope analyses showed no change. These results suggest that in the 
      introduced range B. chinensis remains a termite predator but also feeds on other 
      consumer invertebrates with younger diet ages such as herbivorous insects. 
      Radiocarbon analysis allowed us to elucidate cryptic dietary change associated 
      with invasion success.

TI  - Contribution of deltaic wetland food sources to coastal macrobenthic consumers

AB  - Estuaries are known to export huge quantities of terrigenous/riverine organic 
      matter and nutrients to coastal areas, subsidizing food sources to their 
      communities; however, this process is seldom investigated in complex multichannel 
      delta-prodelta systems. Stable isotope analysis was used to investigate the 
      contribution of organic sources originated from the Po River Delta, one of the 
      widest deltaic wetlands in the northern Mediterranean Sea, to the diet of the 
      nearby coastal macrobenthic consumers, and their influence on invertebrates' 
      trophic structure and biomass. Following intense river flood events, macrofauna 
      samples were collected in the prodelta area at increasing distance from the main 
      river distributary mouth. Potential primary resources were collected within the 
      delta and the prodelta areas. A terrestrial signal in the primary consumers' diet 
      was evident as a shift in their δ(13)C, being this more (13)C depleted near the 
      main river distributary. The Bayesian mixing models indicated an important 
      contribution of deltaic sources, in particular C4-grass detritus (25-57%), to 
      primary consumers' diet, confirming a strong energetic link between delta and 
      prodelta areas. Overall, most of the consumers' biomass were concentrated at 
      sites close to the main distributary mouth, mainly as suspension and surface 
      deposit feeders. A simplification of the macrobenthic community structure, 
      accompanied by narrower transfer pathways was also evident at sites more distant 
      from the main river distributary, in relation to changes in the quality of 
      resources. Our data, although limited to winter season, suggest that during 
      periods of low in situ productivity but high river flow energy, invertebrates are 
      able to efficiently exploit terrigenous food sources, restraining the detrimental 
      effect of increased turbidity and sedimentation. We conclude that 
      riparian/wetland vegetation associated with river deltas can provide important 
      food sources to marine primary consumers. These results furthermore highlight the 
      need for integrated management and protection strategies of connected land-sea 
      ecosystems.

TI  - Modeling food web structure and selenium biomagnification in Lake Macquarie, New 
      South Wales, Australia, using stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes.
PG  - 608-17

AB  - As a consequence of coal-fired power station operations, elevated selenium 
      concentrations have been reported in the sediments and biota of Lake Macquarie 
      (New South Wales, Australia). In the present study, an ecosystem-scale model has 
      been applied to determine how selenium in a seagrass food web is processed from 
      sediments and water through diet to predators, using stable isotopes (δ(13) C and 
      δ(15) N) to establish the trophic position of organisms. Trophic position, 
      habitat, and feeding zone were examined as possible factors influencing selenium 
      bioaccumulation. Selenium concentrations ranged from 0.2 μg/g dry weight in 
      macroalgae species to 12.9 μg/g in the carnivorous fish Gerres subfasciatus. A 
      mean magnification factor of 1.39 per trophic level showed that selenium is 
      biomagnifying in the seagrass food web. Habitat and feeding zone influenced 
      selenium concentrations in invertebrates, whereas feeding zone was the only 
      significant factor influencing selenium concentrations in fish. The 
      sediment-water partitioning coefficient (Kd ) of 4180 showed that partitioning of 
      selenium entering the lake to particulate organic material (POM) is occurring, 
      and consequently availability to food webs from POM is high. Trophic transfer 
      factors (invertebrate = 1.9; fish = 1.2) were similar to those reported for other 
      water bodies, showing that input source is not the main determinant of the 
      magnitude of selenium bioaccumulation in a food web, but rather the initial 
      partitioning of selenium into bioavailable POM. Environ Toxicol Chem

TI  - The Effect of Different Habitat Types and Ontogenetic Stages on the Diet Shift of 
      a Critically Endangered Fish Species, Coreius guichenoti (Sauvage and Dabry de

AB  - This study examined the effect of habitat types and ontogenetic stages on the 
      diet shift of Coreius guichenoti (Sauvage and Dabry de Thiersant, 1874), a 
      critically endangered fish species. Based on the stable isotope analysis method, 
      the following was explored: the variations in δ(13)C and δ(15)N values, isotopic 
      niche width and four basal food sources (Mollusks, Macrocrustaceans, Aquatic 
      insect larvae and particulate organic matters (POMs)) among three essential 
      habitat types (the spawning ground, natural riverine feeding and nursery area, 
      and Three Gorges Reservoir area) and between two ontogenetic stages (immature and 
      fully mature stages). A diet shift associated with habitat type changes was 
      observed, but there were no obvious differences in diet composition between the 
      two ontogenetic stages. Dietary plasticity and a preference for specific foods 
      were the important determinants of feeding behavior through the life history of 
      this species. POM was important for the survival of this species in the 
      resource-limited spawning ground, but this species fed more heavily on 
      higher-order consumers in resource-abundant areas. This study highlights the 
      importance of maintaining free connectivity among different habitats 
      (particularly spawning grounds) to ensure the long-term sustainability of 
      potamodromous fish species as well as the full investigation of all types of 
      critical habitats for understanding the trophic ecology of a single fish species.

AB  - In this study, 26 surface seawater samples, 26 surface sediment samples and 114 
      organisms were collected to study the trophic transfer and dietary exposure risk 
      of mercury (Hg) in organisms from the Jiaozhou Bay, which is a typical 
      semi-enclosed urbanized bay. The total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) 
      concentrations did not exceed the threshold limits and performed as: 
      fish > crustaceans > mollusks. The trophic level values (TLs) were less than 3 in 
      all the groups, indicating simple structure of food chain. With the increasing 
      δ(15)N value, THg and MeHg were significantly biomagnified in the mollusks and 
      fish but not in the crustaceans. In addition, the bioaccumulation and 
      biomagnification of MeHg were higher than inorganic mercury (IHg) in the aquatic 
      food chain. Target hazard quotient (THQ) and provisional tolerable weekly intake 
      (PTWI) indicated that Hg exposure via consumption of seafood from the Jiaozhou 
      Bay did not pose significant health risks for general population. Consuming fish 
      will face the higher health risk than crustaceans and mollusks, especially in 
      urban regions. Moreover, the risk of MeHg caused by intaking seafood deserved 
      more attention. Trophic transfer function (TTF) explicated the transfer of Hg in 
      the ecosystem and higher trophic transfer efficiency of MeHg than IHg. TTF 
      interpreted the terrestrial input of Hg should be controlled to ensure the safety 
      of consuming seafood from the Jiaozhou Bay.

TI  - Biological impacts of local vs. regional land use on a small tributary of the 
      Seine River (France): insights from a food web approach based on stable isotopes.
PG  - 23583-23594
LID - 10.1007/s11356-017-8771-5 [doi]
AB  - As part of the landscape, streams are influenced by land use. Here, we 
      contributed to the understanding of the biological impacts of land use on 
      streams, investigating how landscape effects vary with spatial scales (local vs. 
      regional). We adopted a food web approach integrating both biological structure 
      and functioning, to focus on the overall effect of land use on stream biocœnosis. 
      We selected 17 sites of a small tributary of the Seine River (France) for their 
      contrasted land use, and conducted a natural experiment by sampling three organic 
      matter sources, three macroinvertebrate taxa, and most of the fish community. 
      Using stable isotope analysis, we calculated three food web metrics evaluating 
      two major dimensions of the trophic diversity displayed by the fish community: 
      (i) the diversity of exploited resources and (ii) the trophic level richness. The 
      idea was to examine whether (1) land-use effects varied according to spatial 
      scales, (2) land use affected food webs through an effect on community structure 
      and (3) land use affected food webs through an effect on available resources. 
      Beside an increase in trophic diversity from upstream to downstream, our 
      empirical data showed that food webs were influenced by land use in the riparian 
      corridors (local scale). The effect was complex, and depended on site's position 
      along the upstream-downstream gradient. By contrast, land use in the catchment 
      (regional scale) did not influence stream biocœnosis. At the local scale, 
      community structure was weakly influenced by land use, and thus played a minor 
      role in explaining food web modifications. Our results suggested that the amount 
      of available resources at the base of the food web was partly responsible for 
      food web modifications. In addition, changes in biological functioning (i.e. 
      feeding interactions) can also explain another part of the land-use effect. These 
      results highlight the role played by the riparian corridors as a buffer zone, and 
      advocate that riparian corridor should be at the centre of water management 
      attention.

TI  - Reconstruction of human subsistence and husbandry strategies from the Iberian 
      Early Neolithic: A stable isotope approach.
PG  - 257-271
LID - 10.1002/ajpa.23622 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Early Neolithic involved an important social and economic shift 
      that can be tested not only with the material culture, but also through 
      biomolecular approaches. The Iberian Peninsula presents few Early Neolithic sites 
      where fauna and humans can be analyzed together from an isotopic perspective. 
      Here we present an isotopic study on the site of Cueva de Chaves as an example 
      for understanding the dietary and economical changes that took place during Early 
      Neolithic in Iberia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Here we apply carbon and nitrogen 
      stable isotope analysis to bone collagen from 4 humans and 64 faunal samples from 
      14 different species. The large dataset belongs to the same unique 
      chrono-cultural context secured by 20 radiocarbon dates. Three direct new 
      radiocarbon dates were carried out on the human remains analyzed. RESULTS: Faunal 
      isotope values show no significant differences between wild and domestic 
      herbivores, although the latter have more homogeneous values. Domestic pigs, 
      potentially considered omnivorous, also show signatures of a herbivore diet. 
      Human isotopic results show a diet mainly based on terrestrial C(3) resources and 
      possibly high meat consumption. The only individual found buried with a special 
      funerary treatment presents a slightly different protein intake, when taking into 
      account the long contemporaneous baseline analyzed. DISCUSSION: Similar values 
      between wild and domestic species could be the result of common feeding resources 
      and/or grazing on the same parts of the landscape. The herbivore diet seen 
      amongst domestic pigs rules out feeding on household leftovers. High meat 
      consumption by humans would support the hypothesis of the existence of a 
      specialized animal husbandry management community in which agriculture was not 
      intensively developed. Our results suggest that the development of agricultural 
      practices and animal husbandry were not necessarily associated together in the 
      early stages of the Western Mediterranean Neolithic.

TI  - Integrating DNA-Based Prey Occurrence Probability into Stable Isotope Mixing 
      Models.
PG  - 211-222
LID - 10.1093/icb/icac086 [doi]
AB  - The introduction of laboratory methods to animal dietary studies has allowed 
      researchers to obtain results with accuracy and precision, not possible with 
      observational techniques. For example, DNA barcoding, or the identification of 
      prey with taxon-specific DNA sequences, allows researchers to classify digested 
      prey tissues to the species-level, while stable isotope analysis paired with 
      Bayesian mixing models can quantify dietary contributions by comparing a 
      consumer's isotopic values to those derived from their prey. However, DNA-based 
      methods are currently only able to classify, but not quantify, the taxa present 
      in a diet sample, while stable isotope analysis can only quantify dietary taxa 
      that are identified a priori as prey isotopic values are a result of life history 
      traits, not phylogenetic relatedness. Recently, researchers have begun to couple 
      these techniques in dietary studies to capitalize on the reciprocal benefits and 
      drawbacks offered by each approach, with some even integrating DNA-based results 
      directly into Bayesian mixing models as informative priors. As the informative 
      priors used in these models must represent known dietary compositions (e.g., 
      percentages of prey biomasses), researchers have scaled the DNA-based frequency 
      of occurrence of major prey groups so that their normalized frequency of 
      occurrence sums to 100%. Unfortunately, such an approach is problematic as priors 
      stemming from binomial, DNA-based data do not truly reflect quantitative 
      information about the consumer's diet and may skew the posterior distribution of 
      prey quantities as a result. Therefore, we present a novel approach to 
      incorporate DNA-based dietary information into Bayesian stable isotope mixing 
      models that preserves the binomial nature of DNA-based results. This approach 
      uses community-wide frequency of occurrence or logistic regression-based 
      estimates of prey occurrence to dictate the probability that each prey group is 
      included in each mixing model iteration, and, in turn, the probability that each 
      iteration's results are included in the posterior distribution of prey 
      composition possibilities. Here, we demonstrate the utility of this method by 
      using it to quantify the prey composition of nestling Louisiana waterthrush 
      (Parkesia motacilla).

TI  - Diet shift in bank voles induced by competition from grey-sided voles?
PG  - 376-382
LID - 10.1111/1749-4877.12369 [doi]
AB  - Grey-sided voles (Myodes rufocanus) and bank voles (Myodes glareolus) co-exist in 
      boreal forests in northern Scandinavia. Previous studies suggest that the 2 
      species interact interspecifically, the grey-sided vole being the dominant 
      species. We tested the hypothesis that bank voles shift their diet due to 
      competition with the dominant grey-sided vole by studying stable isotope ratios 
      in both species. Muscle samples were taken from voles in patches of old forest 
      occupied by only bank voles and patches of old forest occupied by both grey-sided 
      voles and bank voles. We found that: (i) stable isotope ratios of bank voles 
      differed in areas with and without grey-sided voles; and that (ii) the stable 
      isotope ratios of bank voles were more similar to those of grey-sided voles in 
      areas where grey-sided voles were absent. Our data suggests that grey-sided voles 
      forced bank voles to change their diet due to interspecific competition.

AB  - Rock crab Cancer irroratus and American lobster Homarus americanus are important 
      commercial species in coastal areas where intensive salmon aquaculture occurs in 
      eastern Canada. Such aquaculture releases organic wastes, especially feed waste 
      (i.e. food pellets made in part from terrestrial feed ingredients). Terrestrial 
      compounds from feed wastes were used to trace their consumption by the two 
      decapods in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. Both species were collected in farms and 
      reference sites and their fatty acid profiles evaluated. Individuals in close 
      proximity to salmon farms were found to consume waste feed (high proportions of 
      18:1n-9 and 18:2n-6 and low proportions of 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3). This consumption 
      is associated with a reduction in diet diversity and a trend of increased lipid 
      content in rock crab, suggesting that this species is more receptive to the waste 
      feed than the American lobster, which did not show evidence of diet diversity 
      loss and of increased lipid content. Fatty acid profiles from rock crab ovaries 
      were also affected by the diet shift toward waste feed (low proportion of 
      long-chain essential fatty acids), suggesting a potential influence on crab 
      reproductive success. However, this remains to be assessed. Resulting effects of 
      diet shifts on the ecosystem (e.g. reduction in the consumption of primary 
      consumers and change of fatty acids transferred to predatory fish or gulls 
      through decapods) should be evaluated to assess the spatial and temporal scales 
      of the salmon aquaculture footprint. If the assessment reveals a strong 
      footprint, measures to reduce wastes could be considered (e.g. pellets with 
      greater buoyancy or with different recipe).

AB  - BACKGROUND: About 4 x 10(5) eggs in more than 5000 marine turtle nests are 
      deposited every year on a 3.6 km long beach in French Guiana (South America). The 
      dry biomass of eggs is estimated to be 5 x 10(3) kg, yet only 25% of this organic 
      matter will return to the ocean in the form of hatchlings. Such amounts of 
      organic matter are supposed to drive the functioning of the beach ecosystem. 
      Previous studies have shown that egg predators and detritivorous organisms 
      dominate the trophic relationships and the dynamics of the system. The role of a 
      terrestrial insect Scapteriscus didactylus (Latreille), which damages up to 40% 
      of the eggs of the marine turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), was unexpected. However 
      it was impossible from direct observations to prove that the mole cricket 
      consumed a significant amount of these eggs. Therefore, the precise place of the 
      mole cricket in the nitrogen and carbon cycles of the beach ecosystem could not 
      be determined. In order to answer this question, we looked for a marine signature 
      of carbon and nitrogen source metabolized by the mole cricket. RESULTS: This 
      study estimated the individual variability of delta13C and delta15N in the 
      cuticle of Scapteriscus didactylus. The isotopic signature was compared between 
      individuals collected at two sites: a village where mole crickets fed on human 
      food scraps and the nearby Awala-Yalimapo beach, where food availability depends 
      seasonally on the nesting sea turtles. The mole crickets collected near the 
      habitations garbage showed no significant variations in the stable isotopic 
      signature, within-and between age groups. On the contrary, isotopic values 
      shifted from a signature of a terrestrial herbivorous diet in the mole crickets 
      during early developmental stages, to isotopic values in adults in accordance 
      with the exploitation of marine animal resources. CONCLUSION: The heterogeneity 
      of individual signatures during the year is due to a selective exploitation of 
      the food sources, differing in space and time. Some individuals, from the beach 
      sample consumed a sufficient quantity of turtle eggs to induce the increase of 
      isotopic enrichment observed in the cuticle. Scapteriscus didactylus is an 
      opportunist feeder and plays a role in the turn over of the beach organic matter.

AB  - The human exploitation of marine resources is characterised by the preferential 
      removal of the largest species. Although this is expected to modify the structure 
      of food webs, we have a relatively poor understanding of the potential 
      consequences of such alteration. Here, we take advantage of a collection of 
      ancient consumer tissues, using stable isotope analysis and SIBER to assess 
      changes in the structure of coastal marine food webs in the South-western 
      Atlantic through the second half of the Holocene as a result of the sequential 
      exploitation of marine resources by hunter-gatherers, western sealers and modern 
      fishermen. Samples were collected from shell middens and museums. Shells of both 
      modern and archaeological intertidal herbivorous molluscs were used to 
      reconstruct changes in the stable isotopic baseline, while modern and 
      archaeological bones of the South American sea lion Otaria flavescens, South 
      American fur seal Arctocephalus australis and Magellanic penguin Spheniscus 
      magellanicus were used to analyse changes in the structure of the community of 
      top predators. We found that ancient food webs were shorter, more redundant and 
      more overlapping than current ones, both in northern-central Patagonia and 
      southern Patagonia. These surprising results may be best explained by the huge 
      impact of western sealing on pinnipeds during the fur trade period, rather than 
      the impact of fishing on fish populations. As a consequence, the populations of 
      pinnipeds at the end of the sealing period were likely well below the ecosystem's 
      carrying capacity, which resulted in a release of intraspecific competition and a 
      shift towards larger and higher trophic level prey. This in turn led to longer 
      and less overlapping food webs.

AB  - Foliar stable isotopic signatures of nitrogen, carbon, and sulfur in mangrove 
      vegetation from the Pacific coast of Panama were insensitive to inputs from 
      watersheds with different area of forest land cover, and to seasonal, 
      inter-annual, and global-scale-driven contrasts in rainfall and upwelling. N, C, 
      and S content of mangrove vegetation were not affected by inputs from watersheds 
      with different degrees of deforestation, but showed some influence of 
      down-estuary transformations. While there was substantial variation that remained 
      un-explained, isotopic signatures and nutrient contents were largely determined 
      by species-specific features, and showed substantial small-scale variation 
      reflecting local differences, within-estuary plant-sediment links. The ability of 
      mangrove estuaries to erase effects of deforestation points out that conservation 
      of these wetland ecosystems is important, because, at least in the sites we 
      studied, transformations within mangrove estuaries were strong enough to protect 
      water quality in receiving coastal waters.

TI  - Is there an indication of the origin of nutrient supply in different 
      morphological structures of macrofauna at two different Brazilian southeastern 
      sandy beaches? Comparison by C and N stable isotopes.
PG  - 33023-33029
LID - 10.1007/s11356-019-06376-4 [doi]
AB  - The goals of this study were to analyze if there is a difference in the stable 
      isotopic ratio (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) of macrobenthic species sampled at two sandy 
      beaches (one close to a river mouth and the other far from any freshwater input) 
      and to identify differences in the stable isotopic ratio (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) in 
      different body parts of three representative species of two Brazilian sandy beach 
      macrofaunas: the polychaete Hemipodia californiensis, the mollusk bivalve Donax 
      hanleyanus, and the crustacean decapod Emerita brasiliensis. No significant 
      differences were detected in the δ(13)C stable isotopic ratio between the two 
      sites analyzed; however, in the δ(15)N stable isotopic ratio, a significant 
      difference was observed. Regarding the intraspecific response of stable isotopic 
      ratio, D. hanleyanus showed a significant difference in carbon among different 
      body part structures, while a trend for significance was observed for nitrogen 
      isotopes. The differences were significant for both isotopes in E. brasiliensis, 
      and no differences were observed among the body part structures in H. 
      californiensis. There were significant differences in E. brasiliensis carapaces 
      with regard to the δ(15)N stable isotopic ratio between the muscle and the whole 
      body. Although the δ(13)C and δ(15)N stable isotopic ratio differs significantly 
      in the digestive tract, muscles, and whole body of D. hanleyanus, such 
      differences were not enough to determine changes in their trophic levels and food 
      sources. Similar stable isotopic ratios were observed in the whole body, 
      proboscis, and teeth of H. californiensis, highlighting this species as the top 
      predator. In conclusion, stable isotopic analysis of benthic trophic structure 
      can be employed as a tool in coastal management plans or environmental impact 
      studies.

TI  - Effects of diet composition and trophic structure on mercury bioaccumulation in 
      temperate flatfishes.
PG  - 431-43
LID - 10.1007/s00244-009-9423-7 [doi]
AB  - The summer flounder Paralichthys dentatus and winter flounder Pseudopleuronectes 
      americanus support valuable fisheries along the northeastern United States. The 
      importance of these flatfish as a human dietary resource indicates they are 
      potential sources of mercury (Hg) to fish-consuming citizens. In this study, 
      summer flounder (SF) and winter flounder (WF) were collected from the 
      Narragansett Bay (Rhode Island, USA) and were measured for total Hg burden in 
      whole-body or dorsal muscle tissue. Interspecies differences in Hg contamination 
      were analyzed relative to flounder body size, age, and Hg content of preferred 
      prey. Stable isotope signatures were also used to elucidate the effect of trophic 
      processes on Hg accumulation in the estuarine food web. The mean Hg content of SF 
      exceeded concentrations measured in WF across multiple life-history stages 
      (0.039-0.100 and 0.016-0.029 mg Hg/kg wet weight for SF and WF, respectively), 
      and observed values for both species were lower than the US Environmental 
      Protection Agency regulatory threshold of 0.3 mg Hg/kg wet weight. Total Hg 
      concentrations were also positively correlated with flounder age and length, 
      verifying that both flatfish bioaccumulate Hg. SF accumulate Hg at an accelerated 
      rate, however, owing to this species consuming Hg-enriched prey (teleosts, squid, 
      and macrocrustaceans; mean Hg content = 0.023 mg Hg/kg wet weight), whereas WF 
      feed on prey with low Hg levels (amphipods and polychaetes; mean Hg content = 
      0.013 mg Hg/kg wet weight). The positive correlation observed between mean biota 
      Hg content and stable nitrogen (delta(15)N) isotope signatures further indicates 
      that Hg is trophically transferred through the food web, and higher trophic level 
      organisms (i.e., enriched delta(15)N) have increased Hg concentrations. 
      Therefore, results from this study suggest that dietary preference and trophic 
      structure are the main factors affecting Hg bioaccumulation in the estuary. Total 
      Hg concentrations of flatfish from the Narragansett Bay, however, do not 
      necessarily reflect coastwide contamination patterns. This reinforces the 
      importance of having research conducted at sufficiently small spatial scales, 
      including the local assessment of Hg contamination for the purpose of issuing 
      state consumption advisories.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate if aquatic pollution promote diet 
      shifts in two livebearer fishes (Poeciliidae): an exotic species, the guppy 
      (Poecilia reticulata), and a native livebearer (Phalloceros uai). The study was 
      carried out in a Brazilian basin highly impacted by anthropogenic activities, 
      especially discharge of domestic and industrial sewage from a region with more 
      than five million human inhabitants. To evaluate the trophic ecology of both 
      native and exotic species it was analysed carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) 
      stable isotopes of fish tissue, food resources and, sewage. Moreover, stable 
      isotopes analyses were coupled with gut contents of the two species to provide 
      additional information about fish diet. Exotic guppy abundance was high in the 
      most polluted site, where P. reticulata assimilated carbon directly from sewage. 
      The native species was absent in the most polluted site, but presented wider 
      niches than the exotic species in almost all other sites. Gut content analyses 
      indicated high consumption of aquatic insects by both species. However, while the 
      native species consumed a diverse suite of insect taxa, the exotic species 
      consumed mainly Chironomidae larvae. We conclude that aquatic pollution promotes 
      diet shifts in both native and exotic species, with both species changing their 
      trophic niches in a similar way according to the level of degradation of the 
      environment. The ability to directly assimilate sewage, together with its 
      capacity to survive in environments with poor water quality and its reproductive 
      strategy, may favour the establishment of exotic guppies in strongly polluted 
      sites.

TI  - Food web of a confined and anthropogenically affected coastal basin (the Mar 
      Piccolo of Taranto) revealed by carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes analyses.
PG  - 12725-38
LID - 10.1007/s11356-015-5380-z [doi]
AB  - Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis was used to examine the food web of 
      the Mar Piccolo of Taranto, a coastal basin experiencing several anthropogenic 
      impacts. Main food sources (algal detritus, seaweeds, particulate organic matter 
      (POM) and sediment organic matter (SOM)) and benthic and pelagic consumers were 
      collected during two contrasting seasons (June and April), at four sites 
      distributed over two inlets, and characterized by different level of 
      confinements, anthropogenic inputs and the presence of mussels farming. δ(13)C 
      values of organic sources revealed an important contribution of POM to both 
      planktonic and benthic pathways, as well as the influence of terrigenous inputs 
      within both inlets, probably due to high seasonal land runoff. Although δ(13)C of 
      both sources and consumers varied little between sampling sites and dates, δ(15)N 
      spatial variability was higher and clearly reflected the organic enrichment in 
      the second inlet as well as the uptake of anthropogenically derived material by 
      benthic consumers. On the other hand, within the first inlet, the isotopic 
      composition of consumers did not change in response to chemical contamination. 
      However, the impact of polluted sediments near the Navy Arsenal in the first 
      inlet was detectable at the level of the macrobenthic trophic structure, showing 
      high dominance of motile, upper level consumers capable to face transient 
      conditions and the reduction of the more resident deposit feeders. We therefore 
      underline the great potential of matching stable isotope analysis with 
      quantitative studies of community structure to assess the effects of multiple 
      anthropogenic stressors.

AB  - Perturbations on ecosystems can have profound immediate effects and can, 
      accordingly, greatly alter the natural community. Land-use such as forestry 
      activities in the Canadian Boreal region have increased in the last decades, 
      raising concerns about their potential impact on aquatic ecosystems. The 
      objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of forest harvesting on 
      trophic structure in eastern Canadian Boreal Shield lakes. We measured carbon and 
      nitrogen stable isotopes values for aquatic primary producers, terrestrial 
      detritus, benthic macroinvertebrates, zooplankton and brook trout (Salvelinus 
      fontinalis) over a three-year period in eight eastern Boreal Shield lakes. Four 
      lakes were studied before, one and two years after forest harvesting (perturbed 
      lakes) and compared with four undisturbed reference lakes (unperturbed lakes) 
      sampled at the same time. Stable isotope mixing models showed leaf-litter to be 
      the main food source for benthic primary consumers in both perturbed and 
      unperturbed lakes, suggesting no logging impact on allochthonous subsidies to the 
      littoral food web. Brook trout derived their food mainly from benthic predatory 
      macroinvertebrates in unperturbed lakes. However, in perturbed lakes one year 
      after harvesting, zooplankton appeared to be the main contributor to brook trout 
      diet. This change in brook trout diet was mitigated two years after harvesting. 
      Size-related diet shift were also observed for brook trout, indicating a diet 
      shift related to size. Our study suggests that carbon from terrestrial habitat 
      may be a significant contribution to the food web of oligotrophic Canadian Boreal 
      Shield lakes. Forest harvesting did not have an impact on the diet of benthic 
      primary consumers. On the other hand, brook trout diet composition was affected 
      by logging with greater zooplankton contribution in perturbed lakes, possibly 
      induced by darker-colored environment in these lakes one year after logging.

AB  - Water is a limiting factor and significant driving force for ecosystem processes 
      in arid and semi-arid areas. Knowledge of plant water uptake pattern is 
      indispensable for understanding soil-plant interactions and species coexistence. 
      The 'Grain for Green' project that started in 1999 in the Loess Plateau of China 
      has led to large scale vegetation change. However, little is known about the 
      water uptake patterns of the main plant species that inhabit in this region. In 
      this study, the seasonal variations in water uptake patterns of three 
      representative plant species, Stipa bungeana, Artemisia gmelinii and Vitex 
      negundo, that are widely distributed in the semi-arid area of the Loess Plateau, 
      were identified by using dual stable isotopes of δ(2)H and δ(18)O in plant and 
      soil water coupled with a Bayesian mixing model MixSIAR. The soil water at the 
      0-120cm depth contributed 79.54±6.05% and 79.94±8.81% of the total water uptake 
      of S. bungeana and A. gmelinii, respectively, in the growing season. The 0-40cm 
      soil contributed the most water in July (74.20±15.20%), and the largest 
      proportion of water (33.10±15.20%) was derived from 120-300cm soils in August for 
      A. gmelinii. However, V. negundo obtained water predominantly from surface soil 
      horizons (0-40cm) and then switched to deep soil layers (120-300cm) as the season 
      progressed. This suggested that V. negundo has a greater degree of ecological 
      plasticity as it could explore water sources from deeper soils as the water 
      stress increased. This capacity can mainly be attributed to its functionally 
      dimorphic root system. V. negundo may have a competitive advantage when 
      encountering short-term drought. The ecological plasticity of plant water use 
      needs to be considered in plant species selection and ecological management and 
      restoration of the arid and semi-arid ecosystems in the Loess Plateau.

TI  - Stable isotopes show food web changes after invasion by the predatory cladoceran 
      Cercopagis pengoi in a Baltic Sea bay.
PG  - 251-9
AB  - Cercopagis pengoi, a recent invader to the Baltic Sea and the Laurentian Great 
      Lakes, is a potential competitor with fish for zooplankton prey. We used stable C 
      and N isotope ratios to elucidate trophic relationships between C. pengoi, 
      zooplankton (microzooplankton, 90-200 microm, mostly copepod nauplii and 
      rotifers; mesozooplankton, >200 microm, mostly copepods), and zooplanktivorous 
      fish (herring, size range 5-15 cm and sprat, 9-11 cm) in a coastal area of the 
      northern Baltic Sea. The isotope ratios in C. pengoi and fish were much higher 
      than those of zooplankton, showing general trends of enrichment with trophic 
      level. Young-of-the-year (YOY) herring had a significantly higher (15)N/(14)N 
      ratio than C. pengoi, suggesting of a trophic linkage between the two species. To 
      evaluate the possible relative importance of different food sources for C. pengoi 
      and YOY herring, two-source isotope-mixing models for N were used, with micro- 
      and mesozooplankton as prey for C. pengoi and mesozooplankton and C. pengoi as 
      prey for YOY herring. These models indicate that mesozooplankton was the major 
      food source of both species. However, microzooplankton may be important prey for 
      young stages of C. pengoi. Comparative analyses of the herring trophic position 
      before and after the invasion by C. pengoi showed a trophic level shift from 2.6 
      to 3.4, indicating substantial alterations in the food web structure. Our 
      findings contribute to a growing body of evidence, showing that C. pengoi can 
      modify food webs and trophic interactions in invaded ecosystems.

AB  - We developed a food web-based transfer factor (TF(web)) to study contaminant 
      movements from multiple prey items to a predator based on the dietary 
      contributions of prey items with their respective contamination levels. TF(web) 
      was used to evaluate the transfer of (137)Cs into whitespotted char (Salvelinus 
      leucomaenis) from the trophic structure of a stream-riparian ecosystem in 
      headwater streams draining a Japanese cedar forest. We also examined the 
      applicability of this method by comparing sites with different contamination 
      levels but similar surrounding environments in Fukushima and Gunma. All samples 
      were collected from August 2012 to May 2013. The dietary contributions from both 
      aquatic and terrestrial prey items to whitespotted char were analyzed using 
      stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios. (137)Cs activity concentrations in 
      char ranged from 704 to 6082 Bq kg(-1)-dry in Fukushima and from 193 to 618 Bq 
      kg(-1)-dry in Gunma. Dominant prey taxa such as mayflies (Ephemera japonica), 
      spider crickets (Rhaphidosphoridae gen. spp.), and freshwater crabs (Geothelphusa 
      dehaani), each of them accounted for 3-12% of the fish diet, based on lower and 
      upper estimates, respectively. TF(web) ranged from 1.12 to 3.79 in Fukushima and 
      from 1.30 to 4.30 in Gunma, which suggested bioaccumulation from prey items to 
      predator. Widely used ecological parameters TFs by media-char and TTF by single 
      prey-char showed high variability with both dilution and accumulation. TF(web) is 
      applicable for (137)Cs transfer in predator-prey systems with complex food web 
      structures of stream-riparian ecosystems.

AB  - The four largest freshwater lakes in southwestern France are of both ecological 
      and economic importance. However, some of them are subjected to mercury (Hg) 
      contamination, resulting in the ban of human consumption of piscivorous fish. 
      Moreover, beyond predatory fish, little information exist regarding Hg levels in 
      other species of these ecosystems. In this context, we used a food web analytical 
      approach to investigate Hg bioaccumulation and biomagnification in relation to 
      the trophic structure of these four lakes. More specifically, various organisms 
      (macrophytes, epiphyton, invertebrates and fish) were collected at the four lakes 
      and analysed for carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes as well as for total Hg 
      (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg). A spatial variability of bioaccumulation in 
      organisms was observed, particularly in carnivorous fish, with higher Hg levels 
      being found in the two more northern lakes (median±SE: 3491 ± 474 and 
      1113 ± 209 ng THg.g(-1) dw in lakes HC and L, respectively) than in the southern 
      pair (600 ± 117 and 911 ± 117 ng THg.g(-1) dw in lakes CS and PB, respectively). 
      Methylmercury biomagnification was observed through the food webs of all four 
      lakes, with different trophic magnification slopes (HC = 0.16; L = 0.33; 
      CS = 0.27; PB = 0.27), even though the length of the food chains was similar 
      between the lakes. Our results suggest that rather than the food web structure, 
      anthropogenic inputs (sulfate in northern lakes and phosphorus inputs in southern 
      ones) may have a strong impact, more or less directly, on Hg methylation in 
      freshwater environments, and lead to concentrations exceeding environmental 
      recommendations despite low Hg backgrounds in sediment and water.

AB  - The future of Madagascar's forests and their resident lemurs is precarious. 
      Determining how species respond to forest fragmentation is essential for 
      management efforts. We use stable isotope biogeochemistry to investigate how 
      disturbance affects resource partitioning between two genera of cheirogaleid 
      lemurs (Cheirogaleus and Microcebus) from three humid forest sites: continuous 
      and fragmented forest at Tsinjoarivo, and selectively logged forest at 
      Ranomafana. We test three hypotheses: (H1) cheirogaleids are unaffected by forest 
      fragmentation, (H2) species respond individually to disturbance and may exploit 
      novel resources in fragmented habitat, and (H3) species alter their behavior to 
      rely on the same key resource in disturbed forest. We find significant isotopic 
      differences among species and localities. Carbon data suggest that Microcebus 
      feed lower in the canopy than Cheirogaleus at all three localities and that 
      sympatric Cheirogaleus crossleyi and C. sibreei feed at different canopy heights 
      in the fragmented forest. Microcbus have higher nitrogen isotope values than 
      Cheirogaleus at all localities, indicating more faunivory. After accounting for 
      baseline isotope values in plants, our results provide the most support for H3. 
      We find similar isotopic variations among localities for both genera. Small 
      differences in carbon among localities may reflect shifts in diet or habitat use. 
      Elevated nitrogen values for cheirogaleid lemurs in fragments may reflect 
      increased arthropod consumption or nutritional stress. These results suggest that 
      cheirogaleids are affected by forest disturbance in Eastern Madagascar and stress 
      the importance of accounting for baseline isotopic differences in plants in any 
      work comparing localities.

AB  - Mercury (Hg), selenium (Se) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) stable isotope were assessed in 
      a tropical food web of Rio de Janeiro's north coast. Isotopic data on muscle 
      suggest a difference related to this parameter along the food web; where 
      top-predators (cetacean and voracious fish) displayed heavier δ(15)N over the 
      entire food web. Both top-predators presented similar δ(15)N values. Cetacean 
      displayed higher Hg and lower Se than voracious fish. Five trophic positions (TP) 
      were found in relation to primary consumer as baseline, ranging from 2.0 to 4.0. 
      Positive relationships were found between trace-element and δ(15)N. The slope of 
      regression equations (0.11 for Se and 0.21 for Hg) and food web magnification 
      factors (2.4 for Se and 5.4 for Hg) showed that Hg presented higher rate of 
      increase over the food web. Simultaneous measurements of trace-elements and 
      ecological tracers emphasize the importance of TP into the trophic structure and 
      distribution of Hg and Se throughout the food web.

      determine whether Cochlodinium bloom-derived organic carbon is incorporated into 
      the subtidal macrobenthic food web, we compared the δ(13)C and δ(15)N values of 
      suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM) and sedimentary organic matter, and 
      macrobenthic consumers between bloom and non-bloom seasons. Chemotaxonomic 
      analysis revealed the presence of Cochlodinium blooms in summer and a 
      predominance of diatoms in autumn. Both the δ(13)C and δ(15)N values of SPOM were 
      higher in the bloom than in the non-bloom seasons. Such temporal shifts in the 
      δ(13)C and δ(15)N values were also observed for most macrobenthic consumers 
      collected in both seasons. Consistent temporal isotopic shifts in SPOM and 
      macrobenthos revealed that the Cochlodinium bloom-derived carbon was incorporated 
      into the coastal benthic food web, resulting from its increasing availability 
      during blooms.

AB  - The Caspian Sea hosts areas of high ecological value as well as industrial, 
      leisure, and agricultural activities that dump into the water body different 
      kinds of pollutants. In this complex context, a proper description of the origin 
      and potential sources of pollution is necessary to address management and 
      mitigation actions aimed at preserving the quality of the water resource and the 
      integrity of the ecosystems. Here, we aimed at detecting sources of both nitrogen 
      inputs, by N stable isotope analysis of macroalgae, and metals in macroalgae and 
      sediments in two highly anthropized coastal stretches at the Iranian side of the 
      Caspian Sea. Sampling was done near the mouth of rivers and canals draining 
      agricultural and urbanized areas. In the westernmost waters, facing a port city, 
      low macroalgal δ(15)N signatures indicated industrial fertilizers as the 
      principal source of pollution. By contrast, in the central coastal waters, facing 
      touristic areas, the high macroalgal δ(15)N indicated N inputs from wastewaters. 
      Here the lowest dissolved oxygen concentrations in waters were associated with 
      excess dissolved inorganic nitrogen. Metal concentrations varied largely in the 
      study areas and were lower in macroalgae than in sediments. Localized peaks of Pb 
      and Zn in sediments were observed in the central coastal sites as probable 
      byproducts of mining activity transported downstream. By contrast, Cr and Ni 
      concentrations were high in all sampling sites, thus potentially representing 
      hazardous elements for marine biota. Overall, macroalgal δ(15)N coupled with 
      metal analysis in macroalgae and sediments was useful for identifying the main 
      sources of pollution in these highly anthropized coastal areas. This double 
      approach in comprehensive monitoring programs could thus effectively inform 
      stakeholders on major environmental threats, allowing targeted management 
      measures.

TI  - Oxygen exchange between (de)nitrification intermediates and H2O and its 
      implications for source determination of NO3- and N2O: a review.
PG  - 3569-78
AB  - Stable isotope analysis of oxygen (O) is increasingly used to determine the 
      origin of nitrate (NO(3)-) and nitrous oxide (N(2)O) in the environment. The 
      assumption underlying these studies is that the (18)O signature of NO(3)- and 
      N(2)O provides information on the different O sources (O(2) and H(2)O) during the 
      production of these compounds by various biochemical pathways. However, exchange 
      of O atoms between H(2)O and intermediates of the (de)nitrification pathways may 
      change the isotopic signal and thereby bias its interpretation for source 
      determination. Chemical exchange of O between H(2)O and various nitrogenous 
      oxides has been reported, but the probability and extent of its occurrence in 
      terrestrial ecosystems remain unclear. Biochemical O exchange between H(2)O and 
      nitrogenous oxides, NO(2)- in particular, has been reported for monocultures of 
      many nitrifiers and denitrifiers that are abundant in nature, with exchange rates 
      of up to 100%. Therefore, biochemical O exchange is likely to be important in 
      most soil ecosystems, and should be taken into account in source determination 
      studies. Failing to do so might lead to (i) an overestimation of nitrification as 
      NO(3)- source, and (ii) an overestimation of nitrifier denitrification and 
      nitrification-coupled denitrification as N(2)O production pathways. A method to 
      quantify the rate and controls of biochemical O exchange in ecosystems is needed, 
      and we argue this can only be done reliably with artificially enriched (18)O 
      compounds. We conclude that in N source determination studies, the O isotopic 
      signature of especially N(2)O should only be used with extreme caution.

TI  - Predicting the competitive interactions and trophic niche consequences of a 
      globally invasive fish with threatened native species.
PG  - 2651-2662
LID - 10.1111/1365-2656.13571 [doi]
AB  - Novel trophic interactions between invasive and native species potentially 
      increase levels of interspecific competition in the receiving environment. 
      However, theory on the trophic impacts of invasive fauna on native competitors is 
      ambiguous, as while increased interspecific competition can result in the species 
      having constricted and diverged trophic niches, the species might instead 
      increase their niche sizes, especially in omnivorous species. The competitive 
      interactions between an omnivorous invasive fish, common carp Cyprinus carpio, 
      and a tropically analogous native and threatened fish, crucian carp Carassius 
      carassius, were tested using comparative functional responses (CFRs). A natural 
      pond experiment then presented the species in allopatry and sympatry, determining 
      the changes in their trophic (isotopic) niche sizes and positions over 4 years. 
      These predictive approaches were complemented by assessing their trophic 
      relationships in wild populations. Comparative functional responses revealed that 
      compared to crucian carp, carp had a significantly higher maximum consumption 
      rate. Coupled with a previous cohabitation growth study, these results predicted 
      that competition between the species is asymmetric, with carp the superior 
      competitor. The pond experiment used stable isotope metrics to quantify shifts in 
      the trophic (isotopic) niche sizes of the fishes. In allopatry, the isotopic 
      niches of the two species were similar sized and diverged. Conversely, in 
      sympatry, carp isotopic niches were always considerably larger than those of 
      crucian carp and were strongly partitioned. Sympatric crucian carp had larger 
      isotopic niches than allopatric conspecifics, a likely response to asymmetric 
      competition from carp. However, carp isotopic niches were also larger in sympatry 
      than allopatry. In the wild populations, the carp isotopic niches were always 
      larger than crucian carp niches, and were highly divergent. The superior 
      competitive abilities of carp predicted in aquaria experiments were considered to 
      be a process involved in sympatric crucian carp having larger isotopic niches 
      than in allopatry. However, as sympatric carp also had larger niches than in 
      allopatry, this suggests other ecological processes were also likely to be 
      involved, such as those relating to fish prey resources. These results highlight 
      the inherent complexity in determining how omnivorous invasive species integrate 
      into food webs and alter their structure.

AB  - The effects of blooms of opportunistic green macroalgae, Ulva prolifera, on the 
      trophic structure of the macrobenthic food web in a temperate intertidal zone on 
      the western coast of Korea were evaluated using carbon and nitrogen stable 
      isotopes. Biomasses of Ulva and microphytobenthos (MPB) increased significantly 
      at the macroalgae-bloom and the non-bloom sites, respectively, from March to 
      September 2011. The δ(13)C values of most the consumers were arrayed between 
      those of MPB and Ulva at both sites, and differed according to feeding strategies 
      at the macroalgae-bloom site. Seasonally increasing magnitudes in δ(13)C and 
      δ(15)N values of consumers were much steeper at the macroalgae-bloom site than at 
      the non-bloom site. Our findings provide evidence that blooming green macroalgae 
      play a significant role as a basal resource supporting the intertidal 
      macrobenthic food web and their significance varies with feeding strategies of 
      consumers as well as the resource availability.

TI  - Multi-tissue stable isotope analysis and acoustic telemetry reveal seasonal 
      variability in the trophic interactions of juvenile bull sharks in a coastal 
      estuary.

AB  - Understanding how natural and anthropogenic drivers affect extant food webs is 
      critical to predicting the impacts of climate change and habitat alterations on 
      ecosystem dynamics. In the Florida Everglades, seasonal reductions in freshwater 
      flow and precipitation lead to annual migrations of aquatic taxa from marsh 
      habitats to deep-water refugia in estuaries. The timing and intensity of 
      freshwater reductions, however, will be modified by ongoing ecosystem restoration 
      and predicted climate change. Understanding the importance of seasonally pulsed 
      resources to predators is critical to predicting the impacts of management and 
      climate change on their populations. As with many large predators, however, it is 
      difficult to determine to what extent predators like bull sharks (Carcharhinus 
      leucas) in the coastal Everglades make use of prey pulses currently. We used 
      passive acoustic telemetry to determine whether shark movements responded to the 
      pulse of marsh prey. To investigate the possibility that sharks fed on marsh 
      prey, we modelled the predicted dynamics of stable isotope values in bull shark 
      blood and plasma under different assumptions of temporal variability in shark 
      diets and physiological dynamics of tissue turnover and isotopic discrimination. 
      Bull sharks increased their use of upstream channels during the late dry season, 
      and although our previous work shows long-term specialization in the diets of 
      sharks, stable isotope values suggested that some individuals adjusted their 
      diets to take advantage of prey entering the system from the marsh, and as such 
      this may be an important resource for the nursery. Restoration efforts are 
      predicted to increase hydroperiods and marsh water levels, likely shifting the 
      timing, duration and intensity of prey pulses, which could have negative 
      consequences for the bull shark population and/or induce shifts in behaviour. 
      Understanding the factors influencing the propensity to specialize or adopt more 
      flexible trophic interactions will be an important step in fully understanding 
      the ecological role of predators and how ecological roles may vary with 
      environmental and anthropogenic changes.

AB  - The concentrations of total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) were assessed 
      in water, sediment and biota (54 species) samples from the coast of Laizhou Bay, 
      to evaluate MeHg biomagnification in Laizhou Bay food web. The trophic web 
      structure was determined with stable isotope ratios. The MeHg concentrations were 
      highly variable among species ranged from 4.8 ng g(-)(1) in primary producers to 
      411.2 ng g(-)(1) in spotted sea bass. Weight and ecotype were the principal 
      parameters related to the mercury concentrations for most species. The trophic 
      magnification factors (TMFs) for MeHg and THg were 2.09 and 1.69, respectively, 
      indicating that mercury biomagnification is occurring in this marine food web. 
      The estimated weekly intake (EWI) and target hazard quotient (THQ) values 
      demonstrated that consuming predatory fishes from the bay could cause potential 
      health risks to humans.

TI  - Bioaccumulation and biomagnification of polybrominated diphenyl ethers in a food 
      web of Lake Michigan.
PG  - 623-34

AB  - Polybrominated diphenyl ethers are hydrophobic chemicals and can biomagnify in 
      food chains. Little is known about the biomagnification of PBDEs in the Lake 
      Michigan food web. Plankton, Diporeia, lake whitefish, lake trout, and Chinook 
      salmon were collected from Lake Michigan in 2006 between April and August. Fish 
      liver and muscle and whole invertebrates were analyzed for six PBDEs (BDE-47, 99, 
      100, 153, 154, and 209). Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta(13)C 
      and delta(15)N) were also quantified in order to establish the trophic structure 
      of the food web. Geometric means of Sigma PBDE concentrations in fish ranged from 
      0.562 to 1.61 microg/g-lipid. BDE-209 concentrations ranged from 0.184 to 1.23 
      microg/g-lipid in all three fish species. Sigma BDE-47, 99, and 209 comprised 
      80-94% of Sigma PBDE molar concentration. Within each fish species, there were no 
      significant differences in PBDE concentrations between liver and muscle. The 
      highest concentration of BDE-209 (144 microg/g-lipid) was detected in Diporeia. 
      Based on analysis of delta(15)N and PBDE concentrations, BDE-47 and 100 were 
      found to biomagnify, whereas BDE-209 did not. A significant negative correlation 
      between BDE-209 and trophic level was found in this food web. Biomagnification 
      factors were also calculated and again BDE-47 and 100 biomagnified between food 
      web members whereas BDE-209 did not. Diporeia could be one of the main dietary 
      sources of BDE-209 for fish in Lake Michigan; BDE-47 and 100 biomagnified within 
      this food chain; the concentration of BDE-209 decreased at higher trophic levels, 
      suggesting partial uptake and/or biotransformation of BDE-209 in the Lake 
      Michigan food web.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities, such as agricultural and industrial development, have 
      increased nutrient inputs into waterways, which affect trophic interactions and 
      the flow of energy through food webs in the aquatic ecosystems. However, the 
      responses of food web structure and function to specific anthropogenic stressors 
      in the alpine stream systems remain unclear. Here, we studied the stream food 
      webs in the Lhasa River on the Tibetan Plateau, China. We measured the isotopic 
      ratios (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) of macroinvertebrate and fish functional feeding 
      groups (FFGs) and their basal resources in the streams. Dietary contributions of 
      basal resources to consumers and food web metrics including trophic length, 
      diversity, and redundancy were used to quantify changes in stream food webs in 
      response to anthropogenic disturbance. Dietary analysis showed that allochthonous 
      resources contributed more than autochthonous resources to macroinvertebrate 
      primary consumers regardless of the disturbance intensity in the adjacent land 
      areas. Anthropogenic activities increased the δ(15)N values in epilithic algae 
      and isotopic variation in basal resources and fish but reduced the trophic length 
      and redundancy (i.e., fewer species or taxon at each trophic level) in food webs. 
      Additionally, the total nitrogen concentration in waters was the most important 
      environmental variable affecting trophic diversity and redundancy. Therefore, the 
      reduction of nitrogen inputs into streams is critical for sustainable river 
      management and biodiversity conservation in the streams on the Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - Tracing rare stable isotopes from plant material through the ecosystem provides 
      the most sensitive information about ecosystem processes; from CO2 fluxes and 
      soil organic matter formation to small-scale stable-isotope biomarker probing. 
      Coupling multiple stable isotopes such as (13)C with (15)N, (18)O or (2)H has the 
      potential to reveal even more information about complex stoichiometric 
      relationships during biogeochemical transformations. Isotope labeled plant 
      material has been used in various studies of litter decomposition and soil 
      organic matter formation(1-4). From these and other studies, however, it has 
      become apparent that structural components of plant material behave differently 
      than metabolic components (i.e. leachable low molecular weight compounds) in 
      terms of microbial utilization and long-term carbon storage(5-7). The ability to 
      study structural and metabolic components separately provides a powerful new tool 
      for advancing the forefront of ecosystem biogeochemical studies. Here we describe 
      a method for producing (13)C and (15)N labeled plant material that is either 
      uniformly labeled throughout the plant or differentially labeled in structural 
      and metabolic plant components. Here, we present the construction and operation 
      of a continuous (13)C and (15)N labeling chamber that can be modified to meet 
      various research needs. Uniformly labeled plant material is produced by 
      continuous labeling from seedling to harvest, while differential labeling is 
      achieved by removing the growing plants from the chamber weeks prior to harvest. 
      Representative results from growing Andropogon gerardii Kaw demonstrate the 
      system's ability to efficiently label plant material at the targeted levels. 
      Through this method we have produced plant material with a 4.4 atom%(13)C and 6.7 
      atom%(15)N uniform plant label, or material that is differentially labeled by up 
      to 1.29 atom%(13)C and 0.56 atom%(15)N in its metabolic and structural components 
      (hot water extractable and hot water residual components, respectively). 
      Challenges lie in maintaining proper temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration, 
      and light levels in an airtight (13)C-CO2 atmosphere for successful plant 
      production. This chamber description represents a useful research tool to 
      effectively produce uniformly or differentially multi-isotope labeled plant 
      material for use in experiments on ecosystem biogeochemical cycling.

TI  - Using stable isotope analysis in stream mesocosms to study potential effects of 
      environmental chemicals on aquatic-terrestrial subsidies.

AB  - While recent research has provided evidence that the emergence of merolimnic 
      insects (species with an aquatic larval stage) provides a considerable energy 
      subsidy to riparian food webs, it has also shown that merolimnic insects may 
      serve as a vector for contaminants. Therefore, riparian food webs may be at risk 
      from either an aquatic-terrestrial transfer of contaminants or from the 
      contaminant-driven reductions of emerging merolimnic insects. The objective of 
      the present study was to develop an integrated stream mesocosms test design 
      capable of identifying these inter-ecosystem boundary effects and to provide a 
      comprehensive approach as a basis for ecotoxicological testing. We chose the 
      widely distributed web-building spider Tetragnatha extensa as a representative 
      species for riparian predators. Trophic aspects of riparian food webs were 
      investigated by stable isotope analysis of carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N). 
      Utilization of stable isotope ratios provided detailed information on the 
      riparian food web structure and the dietary composition of T. extensa. Merolimnic 
      invertebrates (mainly Cloeon spp. and Chironomidae) were found to contribute up 
      to 71 % of T. extensa's diet, demonstrating their importance in riparian food 
      webs in ecotoxicological mesocosm testing. This study provides a conceptual and 
      methodological basis for assessing aquatic insect emergence-related pollutant 
      transfer or effect translation from aquatic to adjacent terrestrial systems.

AB  - Plant water uptake plays an important role in regulating ecosystem water balance 
      and its productivity. However, previous studies regarding plant water uptake were 
      primarily conducted in wet areas under seasonal drought conditions, with a 
      limited understanding of the proportion and drivers of plant water uptake under 
      humid conditions. Actually, climate change and variations in global precipitation 
      patterns could simultaneously trigger seasonal drought and flooding. Therefore, 
      it is critical to explore patterns and mechanisms for plant water uptake under 
      humid conditions in wet regions. Here, we employed dual stable isotopes of 
      hydrogen and oxygen coupled with a Bayesian mixing model (MixSIAR) to explore the 
      water uptake patterns of Populus deltoides in two types of riparian forests (pure 
      vs. mixed stand of P. deltoides), under different magnitudes of rainfall (7.9, 
      15.4 and 34.1 mm), in the Middle-Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River in China. We 
      further used both partial correlation and variation partitioning analyses to 
      determine the relative importance of soil variables and plant properties 
      affecting the proportion of P. deltoides water uptake from different soil layers. 
      Our results revealed that compared to pure stands, P. deltoides in mixed stands 
      had a lower water uptake proportion from deep soil layers (60-80, 80-100 cm) and 
      had higher water uptake from shallow soil layers (0-20, 20-40 cm) under 15.4 mm 
      and 34.1 mm rainfall events. Our results also revealed that plant properties such 
      as leaf biomass, fine root biomass, and diameter at breast height were the 
      primary factors influencing water uptake by P. deltoides. This suggests that P. 
      deltoides in mixed stands could increase the proportion of water uptake from 
      shallow soil layers through altering plant attributes. These findings indicate 
      that mixed stands could restrain frequent extreme rainfall events and subsequent 
      flooding, suggesting more resilience towards future climatic variability.

AB  - The endangered Black-faced Spoonbill (Platalea minor) strictly breeds in marine 
      environments and is threatened by the rapid loss of coastal wetlands within its 
      breeding range. Adults with chicks are thought to gradually switch feeding sites 
      from freshwater wetlands to coastal mudflats as the chicks' osmoregulatory system 
      develops. We investigated age-dependent shifts in the diet of Black-faced 
      Spoonbill chicks at four breeding colonies with varying freshwater habitat 
      availability by examining stable isotopes (δ13C, δ15N) between the tip (grown at 
      the age of 10 days) and middle (grown at the age of 22 days) portions of their 
      primary feathers. The δ13C value of the middle portions was significantly higher 
      than that of the tips, which suggested that the ratio of marine resources 
      increased with the growth and development of chicks. A Bayesian isotope mixing 
      model revealed that the diet proportion of marine prey in the early-chick rearing 
      season was slightly higher than in the late-chick rearing season at three 
      colonies in inshore areas, although this proportion was approximately 60% even in 
      the early chick-rearing period. In contrast, isotopic values and reconstructed 
      diet composition suggested that chicks in an offshore colony with limited 
      freshwater wetlands relied more heavily on freshwater diets for both 
      chick-rearing periods (>80%). Our results suggest that the shifts in feeding 
      sites seen in previous studies might be related to the age-dependent dietary 
      shift of chicks, highlighting the importance of freshwater wetlands for 
      spoonbills on offshore islands without an inflow of freshwater in nearby 
      intertidal mudflats. These findings emphasize the importance of freshwater prey 
      and wetlands even for the endangered marine-breeding spoonbills, even though the 
      negative impact of salt stress remains inconclusive.

TI  - Stable delta(15)N and delta(13)C isotope ratios in aquatic ecosystems.
PG  - 98-107
AB  - In the past 20 years, rapid progress in stable isotope (SI) studies has allowed 
      scientists to observe natural ecosystems from entirely new perspectives. This 
      report addresses the fundamental concepts underlying the use of the SI ratio. The 
      unique characteristics of the SI ratio make it an interdisciplinary parameter 
      that acts as a chemical fingerprint of biogenic substances and provides a key to 
      the world of isotopomers. Variations in SI ratios of biogenic substances depend 
      on the isotopic compositions of reactants, the pathways and kinetic modes of 
      reaction dynamics, and the physicochemical conditions. In fact, every biogenic 
      material has its own isotopic composition, its "dynamic SI fingerprint", which is 
      governed by its function and position in the material flow. For example, the 
      relative SI ratio in biota is determined by dietary lifestyle, e.g., the modes of 
      drinking, eating, and excreting, and appears highly regular due to the 
      physicochemical differences of isotopomers. Our primary goal here is to elucidate 
      the general principals of isotope partitioning in major biophilic elements in 
      molecules, biogenic materials, and ecosystems (Wada, E. et al., 1995). To this 
      end, the nitrogen and carbon SI distribution ratios (delta(15)N and delta(13)C, 
      respectively) are used to examine materials cycling, food web structures, and 
      their variability in various kinds of watershed-including aquatic ecosystems to 
      elucidate an "isotopically ordered world".

AB  - Opportunistic green macroalgae blooms increasingly affect coastal areas 
      worldwide. Understanding their impacts on organisms that use this zone, such as 
      juvenile flatfish, is critical. By combining stable isotope data, digestive tract 
      contents and community analyses of flatfish and their potential prey (benthic 
      macroinvertebrates) from two North-East Atlantic sandy beaches (one impacted by 
      blooms and one not), we detected similar and species-specific trophic changes 
      among three co-occurring species (sand sole, plaice and turbot). Across flatfish 
      species, juveniles displayed more opportunistic foraging behavior at the impacted 
      site. Differently, plaice and sand sole relied more on the additional basal 
      resource (Ulva spp.) than turbot. Finally, sand sole and turbot presented a 
      stronger diet shift at the impacted site than plaice. We hypothesize that the 
      species-specific response to the blooms are mostly driven by how the flatfish 
      detect their prey (using visual and/or chemical cues) and when they forage 
      (diurnal or nocturnal foraging).

LID - 10.1111/gcb.13875 [doi]
AB  - Nearly half of the freshwater discharge into the Gulf of Alaska originates from 
      landscapes draining glacier runoff, but the influence of the influx of riverine 
      organic matter on the trophodynamics of coastal marine food webs is not well 
      understood. We quantified the ecological impact of riverine organic matter 
      subsidies to glacier-marine habitats by developing a multi-trophic level Bayesian 
      three-isotope mixing model. We utilized large gradients in stable (δ(13) C, δ(15) 
      N, δ(2) H) and radiogenic (Δ(14) C) isotopes that trace riverine and marine 
      organic matter sources as they are passed from lower to higher trophic levels in 
      glacial-marine habitats. We also compared isotope ratios between glacial-marine 
      and more oceanic habitats. Based on isotopic measurements of potential baseline 
      sources, ambient water and tissues of marine consumers, estimates of the riverine 
      organic matter source contribution to upper trophic-level species including fish 
      and seabirds ranged from 12% to 44%. Variability in resource use among similar 
      taxa corresponded to variation in species distribution and life histories. For 
      example, riverine organic matter assimilation by the glacier-nesting seabirds 
      Kittlitz's murrelet (Brachyramphus brevirostris) was greater than that of the 
      forest-nesting marbled murrelet (B. marmoratus). The particulate and dissolved 
      organic carbon in glacial runoff and near surface coastal waters was aged 
      (12100-1500 years BP (14) C-age) but dissolved inorganic carbon and biota in 
      coastal waters were young (530 years BP (14) C-age to modern). Thus 
      terrestrial-derived subsidies in marine food webs were primarily composed of 
      young organic matter sources released from glacier ecosystems and their 
      surrounding watersheds. Stable isotope compositions also revealed a divergence in 
      food web structure between glacial-marine and oceanic sites. This work 
      demonstrates linkages between terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and facilitates 
      a greater understanding of how climate-driven changes in freshwater runoff have 
      the potential to alter food web dynamics within coastal marine ecosystems in 
      Alaska.

AB  - Biological invasions are a significant driver of human-induced global change and 
      many ecosystems sustain sympatric invaders. Interactions occurring among these 
      invaders have important implications for ecosystem structure and functioning, yet 
      they are poorly understood. Here we apply newly developed metrics derived from 
      stable isotope data to provide quantitative measures of trophic diversity within 
      populations or species. We then use these to test the hypothesis that sympatric 
      invaders belonging to the same functional feeding group occupy a smaller isotopic 
      niche than their allopatric counterparts. Two introduced, globally important, 
      benthic omnivores, Louisiana swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and carp 
      (Cyprinus carpio), are sympatric in Lake Naivasha, Kenya. We applied our metrics 
      to an 8-year data set encompassing the establishment of carp in the lake. We 
      found a strong asymmetric interaction between the two invasive populations, as 
      indicated by inverse correlations between carp abundance and measures of crayfish 
      trophic diversity. Lack of isotopic niche overlap between carp and crayfish in 
      the majority of years indicated a predominantly indirect interaction. We suggest 
      that carp-induced habitat alteration reduced the diversity of crayfish prey, 
      resulting in a reduction in the dietary niche of crayfish. Stable isotopes 
      provide an integrated signal of diet over space and time, offering an appropriate 
      scale for the study of population niches, but few isotope studies have retained 
      the often insightful information revealed by variability among individuals in 
      isotope values. Our population metrics incorporate such variation, are robust to 
      the vagaries of sample size and are a useful additional tool to reveal subtle 
      dietary interactions among species. Although we have demonstrated their 
      applicability specifically using a detailed temporal dataset of species invasion 
      in a lake, they have a wide array of potential ecological applications.

TI  - Congener-specific accumulation and trophic transfer of polychlorinated biphenyls 
      in spider crab food webs revealed by stable isotope analysis.
PG  - 252-61
AB  - Polychlorobiphenyls (PCB) and stable isotopes (delta15N and delta13C) were 
      analyzed in the spider crab (Maja brachydactyla) food web from the Iroise Sea 
      (Western Brittany) and the Seine Bay (Eastern English Channel). PCB 
      concentrations were all significantly higher in organisms from the Seine Bay than 
      those from the Iroise Sea. PCB patterns were strongly related to the feeding mode 
      of the species, and increased influence of higher chlorinated congeners was 
      highlighted with trophic position of the organisms. PCB concentrations (lipid 
      normalized) were significantly related to the isotopically derived trophic level 
      (TL) in spider crab food webs. The highest trophic magnification factors (TMFs) 
      were calculated for the congeners with 2,4,5-substitution, and were lower in the 
      Seine Bay compared to the Iroise Sea. The confrontation of PCB and TL data also 
      revealed biotransformation capacity of decapod crustaceans for specific congeners 
      based on structure-activity relations.

AB  - Most microorganisms in the biosphere remain uncultured and poorly characterized. 
      Although the surge in genome sequences has enabled insights into the genetic and 
      metabolic properties of uncultured microorganisms, their physiology and 
      ecological roles cannot be determined without direct probing of their activities 
      in natural habitats. Here we employed an experimental framework coupling genome 
      reconstruction and activity assays to characterize the largely uncultured 
      microorganisms responsible for aerobic biodegradation of biphenyl as a proxy for 
      a large class of environmental pollutants, polychlorinated biphenyls. We used 
      (13)C-labeled biphenyl in contaminated soils and traced the flow of 
      pollutant-derived carbon into active cells using single-cell analyses and 
      protein-stable isotope probing. The detection of (13)C-enriched proteins linked 
      biphenyl biodegradation to the uncultured Alphaproteobacteria clade UBA11222, 
      which we found to host a distinctive biphenyl dioxygenase gene widely retrieved 
      from contaminated environments. The same approach indicated the capacity of 
      Azoarcus species to oxidize biphenyl and suggested similar metabolic abilities 
      for species of Rugosibacter. Biphenyl oxidation would thus represent formerly 
      unrecognized ecological functions of both genera. The quantitative role of these 
      microorganisms in pollutant degradation was resolved using single-cell-based 
      uptake measurements. Our strategy advances our understanding of microbially 
      mediated biodegradation processes and has general application potential for 
      elucidating the ecological roles of uncultured microorganisms in their natural 
      habitats.

AB  - Stratified lakes and ponds featuring steep oxygen gradients are significant net 
      sources of greenhouse gases and hotspots in the carbon cycle. Despite their 
      significant biogeochemical roles, the microbial communities, especially in the 
      oxygen depleted compartments, are poorly known. Here, we present a comprehensive 
      dataset including 267 shotgun metagenomes from 41 stratified lakes and ponds 
      mainly located in the boreal and subarctic regions, but also including one 
      tropical reservoir and one temperate lake. For most lakes and ponds, the data 
      includes a vertical sample set spanning from the oxic surface to the anoxic 
      bottom layer. The majority of the samples were collected during the open water 
      period, but also a total of 29 samples were collected from under the ice. In 
      addition to the metagenomic sequences, the dataset includes environmental 
      variables for the samples, such as oxygen, nutrient and organic carbon 
      concentrations. The dataset is ideal for further exploring the microbial 
      taxonomic and functional diversity in freshwater environments and potential 
      climate change impacts on the functioning of these ecosystems.

TI  - Absence of fractionation of mercury isotopes during trophic transfer of 
      methylmercury to freshwater fish in captivity.

AB  - We performed two controlled experiments to determine the amount of mass-dependent 
      and mass-independent fractionation (MDF and MIF) of methylmercury (MeHg) during 
      trophic transfer into fish. In experiment 1, juvenile yellow perch (Perca 
      flavescens) were raised in captivity on commercial food pellets and then their 
      diet was either maintained on unamended food pellets (0.1 μg/g MeHg) or was 
      switched to food pellets with 1.0 μg/g or 4.0 μg/g of added MeHg, for a period of 
      2 months. The difference in δ(202)Hg (MDF) and Δ(199)Hg (MIF) between fish 
      tissues and food pellets with added MeHg was within the analytical uncertainty 
      (δ(202)Hg, 0.07 ‰; Δ(199)Hg, 0.06 ‰), indicating no isotope fractionation. In 
      experiment 2, lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) were raised in captivity on food 
      pellets and then shifted to a diet of bloater (Coregonus hoyi) for 6 months. The 
      δ(202)Hg and Δ(199)Hg of the lake trout equaled the isotopic composition of the 
      bloater after 6 months, reflecting reequilibration of the Hg isotopic composition 
      of the fish to new food sources and a lack of isotope fractionation during 
      trophic transfer. We suggest that the stable Hg isotope ratios in fish can be 
      used to trace environmental sources of Hg in aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Large dams and their respective reservoirs provide renewable energy and water 
      security, but also can profoundly alter riverine ecosystems. Here, we present 
      evidence of changing aquatic food web structure in the seasons following 
      short-duration, extreme manipulation of water levels in a reservoir (i.e., 
      draining of the reservoir to the original riverbed during fall to assist 
      outmigration of juvenile Chinook Salmon). We find unintended and lagged 
      consequences of transitioning from a lake to a river, even temporarily, that 
      resulted in trophic shifts away from piscivory and towards feeding at lower 
      trophic levels for two common piscivorous fishes in reservoirs. Using natural 
      abundances of nitrogen stable isotopes, we observed lower trophic level of 
      feeding for invasive Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides) and native Rainbow 
      Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) during the summers following reservoir refilling than 
      in nearby reference reservoirs that were not temporarily drained during fall. 
      Declines in trophic levels of aquatic top predators have been rarely documented 
      outside of controlled laboratory conditions. While useful for assisting 
      outmigration of juvenile salmonids, the temporary draining of a reservoir to 
      riverbed can also result in novel shifts in foodweb dynamics including reduced 
      piscivory. As large dams continue to be operated and constructed worldwide, 
      increased understanding of the community and ecosystem-level effects of reservoir 
      management will be critical to evaluating trade-offs between human water needs, 
      conservation of high value species, and ecosystem services impacted by river 
      fragmentation.

AB  - Food web trophodynamics of total mercury (THg) and selenium (Se) were assessed 
      for the double-basined ultraoligotrophic system of Lake Moreno, Patagonia. Each 
      basin has differing proportions of littoral and pelagic habitats, thereby 
      providing an opportunity to assess the importance of habitat (e.g. food web 
      structure or benthic MeHg production) in the transfer of Hg and Se to top trophic 
      fish species. Pelagic plankton, analyzed in three size classes (10-53, 53-200, 
      and >200 μm), had very high [THg], exceeding 200 μg g(-1) dry weight (DW) in the 
      smallest, and a low ratio of MeHg to THg (0.1 to 3%). In contrast, [THg] in 
      littoral macroinvertebrates showed lower values (0.3 to 1.8 μg g(-1) DW). 
      Juvenile and small fish species feeding upon plankton had higher [THg] (0.2 to 8 
      μg g(-1) muscle DW) compared to large piscivore fish species (0.1 to 1.6 μg g(-1) 
      muscle DW). Selenium concentrations exhibited a much narrower variation range 
      than THg in the food web, varying from 0.5 to 2.7 μg g(-1) DW. Molar Se:Hg ratios 
      exceeded 1 for the majority of organisms in both basins, with most ratios 
      exceeding 10. Using stable nitrogen isotopes as indicator of trophic level, no 
      significant correlations were found with [THg], [Se] or Se:Hg. The apparent lack 
      of biomagnification trends was attributed to elevated [THg] in plankton in the 
      inorganic form mostly, as well as the possibility of consistent Se supply 
      reducing the biomagnification in the food web of the organic portion of THg.

TI  - RNA Stable Isotope Probing of Potential Feammox Population in Paddy Soil.
PG  - 4841-4849
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.8b05016 [doi]
AB  - Anaerobic ammonium oxidation coupled to iron reduction (Feammox) is a recently 
      discovered pathway contributing to nitrogen loss in various ecosystems such as 
      paddy soils and sediments. However, little is known about the microbes driving 
      Feammox in an agricultural ecosystem. Here, we demonstrated the occurrence of 
      Feammox in paddy soils of Southern China using a (15)N isotopic tracing 
      technique, and examined the microbial communities associated with Feammox using 
      RNA based stable isotope probing (RNA-SIP) combined with Illumina sequencing. 
      Feammox was detected in all collected soils with direct N(2) production as the 
      dominant Feammox pathway. It was estimated that approximately 6.91% of the 
      applied nitrogen fertilizers were lost through Feammox in the paddy soils. 
      RNA-SIP results showed that the composition of enriched active microbial 
      communities were dependent on soil properties, especially the soil pH and grain 
      size. Geobacter were enriched in most soils across various properties. The 
      abundance of enriched GOUTA19 were significantly higher in soils with low pH than 
      those in soils with medium pH and high pH, and the relative abundance of active 
      Nitrososphaeraceae and Pseudomonas only increased in soils with medium and high 
      pH during 4-day of incubation. These results suggested Feammox is a ubiquitous 
      and important process for N loss. Geobacter, GOUTA19, Nitrososphaeraceae and 
      Pseudomonas were active during the incubation that favored Feammox and the growth 
      of Feammox microbes, suggesting these microbes were potentially associated with 
      Feammox in natural agricultural soils.

PG  - 2292-2298
LID - 10.13287/j.1001-9332.201707.019 [doi]
AB  - Stable isotope technique was applied to investigate the small and medium-size 
      consumers including not only fish, shrimps, crabs, cephalopods, snails and 
      bivalves, but also the specimens of their potential carbon sources, which were 
      collected in the marine ranching area of Haizhou Bay during the spring of 2015. 
      IsoSource model was adopted to calculate the contribution of potential carbon 
      sources to the consumers. Biospeciemens collected in the summer of 2014 were 
      compared with those in the spring of 2015, aiming to analyze the seasonal 
      variation in the trophic structure of food web. Six quantitative community 
      indices were calculated based on the isotope values of the organisms in Haizhou 
      Bay. The results showed that the δ(13)C values of consumers ranged from -18.9‰ to 
      -17.1‰, and the δ(13)C values of three potential food sources ranged from -18.1‰ 
      to -23.4‰ in the spring of 2015. The calculation results of IsoSource model 
      further demonstrated that the phytoplankton was the most important carbon source 
      for consumers (80.8%), followed by sediment organic matter (10.8%) and 
      particulate organic matter (8.4%). There was a significant difference in the 
      δ(13)C values between the biospecimens in the summer of 2014 and those in the 
      spring of 2015, while no significant difference was observed in δ(15)N values. 
      Trophic structure of community-wide differed remarkably in different seasons 
      indicated by the six quantitative community indices. The δ(13)C range, total 
      area, mean nearest neighbor distance and standard deviation of nearest neighbor 
      distance of the community were much higher in 2014 than those in 2015, but the 
      δ(15)N range and mean distance to centroid showed no significant change. The 
      trophic structure redundancy was lower in the summer of 2014 compared with that 
      in the spring of 2015, however, the diversity of food resources was higher in the 
      summer of 2014.

AB  - In many regions of the world, large populations of native wildlife have declined 
      or been replaced by livestock grazing areas and farmlands, with consequences for 
      terrestrial-aquatic ecosystem connectivity and trophic resources supporting food 
      webs in aquatic ecosystems. The river continuum concept (RCC) and the riverine 
      productivity model (RPM) predict a shift of energy supplying aquatic food webs 
      along rivers: from terrestrial inputs in low-order streams to autochthonous 
      production in mid-sized rivers. In Afromontane-savanna landscapes, the shifting 
      numbers of large mammalian wildlife present a physical continuum whose ecological 
      implications for rivers is not clearly understood. Here, we studied the influence 
      of replacing large wildlife (mainly hippos) with livestock on the fractional 
      contribution of C3 vegetation, C4 grasses and periphyton on macroinvertebrates in 
      the Mara River, which is an African montane-savanna river known to receive large 
      subsidy fluxes of terrestrial organic matter and nutrients mediated by large 
      mammalian herbivores (LMH), both wildlife and livestock, in its middle and lower 
      reaches. Using stable carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) isotopes, we 
      identified spatial patterns in the fractional contribution of allochthonous 
      organic matter from C3 and C4 plants (woody vegetation and grasses, respectively) 
      and autochthonous energy from periphyton for macroinvertebrates at various sites 
      of the Mara River and its tributaries. Potential energy sources and invertebrates 
      were sampled at 80 sites spanning stream orders 1 to 7, various catchment land 
      uses (forest, agriculture and grasslands) and different loading rates of organic 
      matter and nutrients by LMH (livestock and wildlife, i.e., hippopotamus). The 
      fractional contribution of different sources of energy for macroinvertebrates 
      along the river did not follow predictions of the RCC and RPM. First, the 
      fractional contribution of C3 and C4 carbon was not related to river order or 
      location along the fluvial continuum but to the loading of organic matter (dung) 
      by both wildlife and livestock. Notably, C4 carbon was important for 
      macroinvertebrates even in large river sections inhabited by hippos. Second, even 
      in small 1st -3rd order forested streams, periphyton was a major source of energy 
      for macroinvertebrates, and this was fostered by livestock inputs fuelling 
      aquatic primary production throughout the river network. Importantly, our results 
      show that replacing wildlife (hippos) with livestock shifts river systems towards 
      greater reliance on autochthonous sources of energy through an algae-grazer 
      pathway as opposed to reliance on allochthonous inputs of C4 carbon through a 
      detrital pathway.

AB  - Skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) sustain a large-scale fishery in the southwest 
      Atlantic Ocean (SWA), but information about its foraging ecology in this region 
      is still limited. Here we use carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) stable 
      isotope analysis of muscle from individuals collected in 2017-2018 (n = 383) to 
      quantify diet composition and characterize movement patterns. We found a 
      relatively small degree of variation in δ(13)C (range: -18.9 to -16.5‰) in 
      comparison to δ(15)N values (6.7-14.7‰). At higher latitudes in the southern area 
      (30-34°S), individuals had higher mean (±SD) δ(15)N values (12.2 ± 1.3‰) in 
      comparison to those collected in the northern area (9.7 ± 1.5‰) between 20-26°S. 
      At the northern area, isotope mixing models with informative priors showed that 
      lanternfish (median: 50%) and krill (31%) were the primary foods. In the southern 
      area, lanternfish (53%), krill (23%) and small pelagic fish (23%) were the 
      primary food sources. Spatial shifts in diet composition were related to warming 
      events that likely resulted in low abundance of sardines in the northern area. 
      The latitudinal pattern in skipjack and krill δ(15)N values mirrored that of 
      regional zooplankton isoscapes, suggesting residency at the timescale of isotopic 
      turnover for muscle (~2-4 months), and that geographical variation in the 
      baseline isotopic composition can be exploited to characterize seasonal movements 
      of skipjack and other top marine consumers in this region.

TI  - You are how you eat: differences in trophic position of two parasite species 
      infecting a single host according to stable isotopes.
PG  - 1393-1400

AB  - Parasitism is commonly recognised as a consumer strategy, although, the 
      interaction of parasites in communities and ecosystems are generally poorly 
      understood. As parasites are integral parts of food webs, analysis of the trophic 
      interactions between parasites and hosts was assessed through comparison of 
      stable isotope ratios of carbon ((13)C/(12)C) and nitrogen ((15)N/(14)N). 
      Largemouth yellowfish (Labeobarbus kimberleyensis) infected with the Asian 
      tapeworm (Schyzocotyle acheilognathi) were collected from the Vaal Dam. 
      Signatures of δ(13)C and δ(15)N were assessed in host muscle and liver tissue, 
      and cestodes using an elemental analyser coupled with an isotope ratio-mass 
      spectrometer (EA-IRMS). Hosts were enriched by 4.1‰ in the heavy nitrogen isotope 
      with respect to the S. acheilognathi and therefore occupy a higher trophic 
      position than the parasite. Comparison of δ(13)C indicates that dietary sources 
      of carbon in cestodes are derived from the host liver. Comparison of stable 
      isotope signatures between Paradiplozoon ichthyoxanthon (another common parasite 
      of the Largemouth yellowfish in the Vaal River) and S. acheilognathi showed that 
      the monogenean was enriched by 5.3‰ in (15)N which accounts for a difference of 
      almost two trophic positions. Isotope differences in the host-parasite system 
      considered indicate that differences can be related to the mode of nutrient 
      acquisition employed by host and parasites. Cestodes, being depleted in both 
      (13)C and (15)N relative to the host and monogenean (P. ichthyoxanthon), indicate 
      that S. acheilognathi assimilates nutrients derived from the host metabolism 
      which are released from the liver.

AB  - The main aim of this study was to ascertain the biomagnification processes in a 
      mercury-contaminated estuary, by clarifying the trophic web structure through 
      stable isotope ratios. For this purpose, primary producers (seagrasses and 
      macroalgae), invertebrates (detritivores and benthic predators) and fish were 
      analysed for total and organic mercury and for stable carbon and nitrogen 
      isotopic signatures. Trophic structure was accurately described by δ(15)N, while 
      δ(13)C reflected the carbon source for each species. An increase of mercury 
      levels was observed with trophic level, particularly for organic mercury. Results 
      confirm mercury biomagnification to occur in this estuarine food web, especially 
      in the organic form, both in absolute concentrations and fraction of total 
      mercury load. Age can be considered an important variable in mercury 
      biomagnification studies, and data adjustments to account for the different 
      exposure periods may be necessary for a correct assessment of trophic 
      magnification rates and ecological risk.

      and stable isotopes (N, Sr and Hg), we evaluate natal origin and trophic position 
      of brown trout (Salmo trutta fario), as well as mercury biomagnification trends 
      and potential pollution sources to three high-altitude lakes. Farmed trout show 
      Hg-isotope signatures similar to marine biota whereas wild trout shows Hg-isotope 
      signatures typical of fresh water lakes. Stocked trout initially show Hg-isotope 
      signatures similar to marine biota. As the stocked trout age and shifts diet to a 
      higher trophic level, THg concentrations increase and the marine Hg isotope 
      signatures, induced via farm fish feed, shift to locally produced MeHg with lower 
      δ(202)Hg and higher Δ(199)Hg. We conclude that stocking acts a humanly induced 
      biovector that transfers marine Hg to freshwater ecosystems, which is seen in the 
      Hg-isotopic signature up to five years after stocking events occurred. This 
      points to the need of further investigations of the role of stocking in MeHg 
      exposure to freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - Ontogenetic shifts in food preference reduces intraspecific competition as 
      immature individuals eat different food types than adults. This diet plasticity 
      could facilitate species' ability to successfully invade and establish itself in 
      a new environment, even when co-occurring with phylogenetically close species. 
      Here, ontogenetic diet shifts of a non-native piranha species (Serrasalmus 
      marginatus) was tested by analyzing the relationship between its body length and 
      the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures. Carbon stable isotope was not 
      correlated to fish length, but positive significant correlation between δ15N 
      values and fish length was found for the non-native piranha. Also, immature and 
      adult S. marginatus showed low isotopic niche overlap. The correlation between 
      fish length and δ15N, and the low trophic overlap between immature and adult, 
      indicate that the non-native S. marginatus had ontogenetic shifts in food 
      preference, which may be viewed as an additional mechanism underlying its 
      successful establishment in the upper Paraná River. Our findings indicate that 
      ontogenetic shifts in food preference may be an invasive trait that facilitates 
      the establishment of non-native fish species in tropical aquatic systems.

TI  - Trophic structure of benthic communities in a Chilean fjord (45°S) influenced by

AB  - Benthic marine food webs, which recycle organic matter and sustain unique 
      biodiversity, are an important component of estuarine Patagonian fjords; however, 
      these may be heavily influenced by salmon farming activities. Under the above 
      conditions, this study collected several food sources (sediment organic matter, 
      suspended particulate organic matter, macroalgae) and 26 benthic invertebrate 
      species, and analyzed them using a Bayesian mixing model. Briefly, carbon and 
      nitrogen stable isotopes analyses revealed that the highly variable isotopic 
      niche widths respond to food supplies from marine and terrestrial organic matter. 
      In addition, particulate and dissolved waste from salmon farming activities were 
      found to modify isotopic composition ratios in many suspension feeders. 
      Particularly, our results indicate high δ(15)N values in the sponge Cliona 
      chilensis and the encrusting coral Incrustatus comauensis, which appear to be 
      potential ecological indicators for evaluating stoichiometry imbalances and trace 
      organic pollution sources in fjord environments.

AB  - Radioiodine is of health concerns in case of nuclear events. Possible pathways 
      and rates of flow are essential information for risk assessment. Forest 
      ecosystems could influence the global cycle of long-lived radioiodine isotope 
      ((129)I) with transfer processes similar to stable isotope ((127)I). 
      Understanding iodine cycling in forest involves study of the ecosystem as a 
      whole. In this context, we determined the (127)I contents and distribution in 
      soil, tree compartments and atmospheric inputs during a three years in situ 
      monitoring of a temperate beech forest stand. The iodine cycle was first 
      characterized in terms of stocks by measuring its concentrations in: tree, 
      litterfall, humus, soil, rainfall, throughfall, stemflow and soil solutions. Main 
      annual fluxes (requirement, uptake and internal transfers) and forest 
      input-output budget were also estimated using conceptual model calculations. Our 
      findings show that: (i) soil is the main I reservoir accounting for about 99.9% 
      of ecosystem total stock; (ii) iodine uptake by tree represents a minor fraction 
      of the available pool in soil (<0.2%); (iii) iodine allocation between tree 
      compartments involves low immobilization in wood and restricted location in the 
      roots; (iv) translocation of excess iodine towards senescing foliage appears as 
      an elimination process for trees, and (v) litterfall is a major pathway in the I 
      biological cycling. In our soil conditions, the input - output budget shows that 
      the ecosystem behaves as a potential source of I for groundwater.

AB  - The community structure, stable isotope ratios ((15)N/(14)N, (13)C/(12)C) and 
      reproductive mode of oribatid mites (Acari, Oribatida) were investigated in four 
      habitats (upper tree bark, lower tree bark, dry grassland soil, forest soil) at 
      two sites in the Central Alps (Tyrol, Austria). We hypothesized that community 
      structure and trophic position of oribatid mites of dry grassland soils and bark 
      of trees are similar since these habitats have similar abiotic characteristics 
      (open, dry) compared with forest soil. Further, we hypothesized that derived taxa 
      of oribatid mites reproducing sexually dominate on the bark of trees since 
      species in this habitat consume living resources such as lichens. In contrast to 
      our hypothesis, the community structure of oribatid mites differed among 
      grassland, forest and bark indicating the existence of niche differentiation in 
      the respective oribatid mite species. In agreement with our hypothesis, sexually 
      reproducing taxa of oribatid mites dominated on the bark of trees whereas 
      parthenogenetic species were more frequent in soil. Several species of 
      bark-living oribatid mites had stable isotope signatures that were similar to 
      lichens indicating that they feed on lichens. However, nine species that 
      frequently occurred on tree bark did not feed on lichens according to their 
      stable isotope signatures. No oribatid mite species could be ascribed to moss 
      feeding. We conclude that sexual reproduction served as preadaptation for 
      oribatid mites allowing them to exploit new habitats and new resources on the 
      bark of trees. Abiotic factors likely are of limited importance for bark-living 
      oribatid mites since harsh abiotic conditions are assumed to favor 
      parthenogenesis.

AB  - Terrestrial arid and semi-arid ecosystems (drylands) constitute about 41% of the 
      Earth's land surface and are predicted to experience increasing fluctuations in 
      water and nitrogen availability. Mounting evidence has confirmed the significant 
      importance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) in 
      nitrification, plant nitrogen availability and atmospheric N2 O emissions, but 
      their responses to environmental perturbations in drylands remain largely 
      unknown. Here we evaluate how the factorial combinations of irrigation and 
      fertilization in forests and land-use change from grassland to forest affects the 
      dynamics of AOA and AOB following a 6-year dryland field study. Potential 
      nitrification rates and AOA and AOB abundances were significantly higher in the 
      irrigated plots, accompanied by considerable changes in community compositions, 
      but their responses to fertilization alone were not significant. DNA-stable 
      isotope probing results showed increased (13) CO2 incorporation into the amoA 
      gene of AOA, but not of AOB, in plots receiving water addition, coupled with 
      significantly higher net mineralization and nitrification rates. High-throughput 
      microarray analysis revealed that active AOA assemblages belonging to 
      Nitrosopumilus and Nitrosotalea were increasingly labelled by (13) CO2 following 
      irrigation. However, no obvious effects of land-use changes on nitrification 
      rates or metabolic activity of AOA and AOB could be observed under dry 
      conditions. We provide evidence that water addition had more important roles than 
      nitrogen fertilization in influencing the autotrophic nitrification in dryland 
      ecosystems, and AOA are increasingly involved in ammonia oxidation when dry soils 
      become wetted.

AB  - Climate change is leading to northward shifts in species distributions that is 
      altering interspecific interactions at low- and mid-trophic levels. However, 
      little attention has been focused on the effects of redistributions of species on 
      the trophic ecology of a high trophic-level predator assemblage. Here, during a 
      22-year period (1990-2012) of increasing sea temperature (1.0°C) and decreasing 
      sea ice extent (12%) in Cumberland Sound, Nunavut, Canada, we examined the 
      trophic structure of a near-apex predator assemblage before (1990-2002) and after 
      (2005-2012) an increase in the availability of capelin-generally an indicator 
      species in colder marine environments for a warming climate. Stable isotopes 
      (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) were used in a Bayesian framework to assess shifts in diet, 
      niche size and community-wide metrics for beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas), 
      ringed seals (Pusa hispida), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and 
      anadromous Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus). After 2005, consumption of forage 
      fish increased for all predator species, suggesting diet flexibility with 
      changing abiotic and biotic conditions. An associated temporal shift from a 
      trophically diverse to a trophically redundant predator assemblage occurred where 
      predators now play similar trophic roles by consuming prey primarily from the 
      pelagic energy pathway. Overall, these long-term ecological changes signify that 
      trophic shifts of a high trophic-level predator assemblage associated with 
      climate change have occurred in the Arctic food web.

AB  - Antarctica is still considered one of the few pristine areas in the globe. 
      Despite this, several studies have shown phased out organic pollutants are 
      present in several environmental abiotic and biological compartments. This study, 
      based on blubber and fecal samples collected from five species of Antarctic 
      pinnipeds, assessed the relationship between organochlorine pesticide (OCs) 
      levels and trophic characterization using stable isotope analysis (δ(13)C and 
      δ(15)N). The prevailing pollutants found in blubber were hexachlorocyclohexane 
      isomers (HCHs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), Heptachlor and Aldrin 
      (0.84-564.11 ng g(-1) l.w.). We also report a high presence of HCHs, Endrin, 
      Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDTs) and Methoxychlor (4.50-363.86 ng g(-1) 
      d.w.) in feces suggesting a detoxification mechanism. All the species tend 
      towards high trophic positions (3.4-4.9), but with considerable variation in 
      trophic niche and organochlorine pesticide concentrations per sampling site. This 
      finding suggests that differences in pesticide levels in individuals are 
      associated to foraging ecology.

      food webs.

AB  - Despite a global phase out of some point sources, mercury (Hg) remains elevated 
      in aquatic food webs, posing health risks for fish-eating consumers. Many 
      tropical regions have fast growing organisms, potentially short food chains, and 
      few industrial point sources, suggesting low Hg baselines and low rates of 
      trophic magnification with limited risk to people. Nevertheless, insufficient 
      work on food-web Hg has been undertaken in the tropics and fish consumption is 
      high in some regions. We studied Hg concentrations in fishes from floodplain 
      lakes of the Juruá River, Amazonas, Brazil with three objectives: 1) determine 
      rates of Hg trophic magnification, 2) assess whether Hg concentrations are high 
      enough to impact humans eating fish, and 3) determine whether there are seasonal 
      differences in fish Hg concentrations. A total of 377 fish-muscle samples were 
      collected from 12 floodplain lakes during the low-water (September 2018) and 
      falling-water (June 2019) seasons and analysed for total Hg and stable nitrogen 
      (N) isotopes. The average trophic magnification factor (increase per trophic 
      level) was 10.1 in the low-water season and 5.4 in the falling-water season, both 
      well above the global average for freshwaters. This high rate of trophic 
      magnification, coupled with higher-than-expected Hg concentrations in herbivorous 
      species, led to high concentrations (up to 17.6 ng/g dry weight) in predatory 
      pirarucu and piranha. Nearly 70% of all samples had Hg concentrations above the 
      recommended human-consumption guidelines. Average concentrations were 42% higher 
      in the low-water season than the falling-water season, but differences varied by 
      species. Since Hg concentrations are higher than expected and fish consumption in 
      this region is high, future research should focus on Hg exposure for human 
      populations here and in other tropical-rainforest regions, even in the absence of 
      local point sources of Hg.

AB  - The bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of As along food webs in freshwater 
      ecosystems remain largely unknown. In this study, multiple environmental and 
      biological samples were collected from a closed realgar mining area in South 
      China. The As concentrations in the surface water, sediments and soils in the 
      mining area were 0.62-3293 μg/L, 9.53-4543 mg/kg and 7.32-5008 mg/kg, 
      respectively, and gradually decreased with distance from the central mining 
      sites, indicating that historic As mining activities had an eminent impact on As 
      contamination around the mine. The As concentrations in aquatic organisms ranged 
      from 0.60 mg/kg to 45.75 mg/kg and varied markedly among sites and species, 
      reflecting the influence of various physiologic and environmental factors. 
      Arsenic species identified by liquid chromatography inductively coupled 
      plasma-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS) were mainly organic, comprising 8% to 66% 
      of the total As. Both the proportions and concentrations of inorganic As were 
      positively correlated with total As. This correlation could be attributed to the 
      higher assimilation and accumulation of inorganic As or the lower 
      biotransformation ability of inorganic As with the increasing total As in the 
      studied organisms. Values of δ(13)C and δ(15)N in aquatic organisms ranged from 
      -30.59‰ to -15.07‰ and from 4.31‰ to 12.98‰, respectively, indicating multiple 
      trophic levels and variety in the diet sources of these organisms. The δ(15)N 
      increased distinctly in the order of 
      planktivorous<herbivorous<omnivorous<carnivorous, which is generally consistent 
      with the increasing trophic levels in the freshwater ecosystem. No significant 
      correlation was observed between As concentrations and δ(15)N in the freshwater 
      organisms, suggesting no biomagnification of As in the food web.

AB  - Climate change driven increases in permafrost thaw and terrestrial runoff are 
      expected to facilitate the mobilization and transport of mercury (Hg) from 
      catchment soils to coastal areas in the Arctic, potentially increasing Hg 
      exposure of marine food webs. The main aim of this study was to determine the 
      impacts of seasonal riverine inputs on land-ocean Hg transport, zooplankton diet 
      and Hg bioaccumulation in an Arctic estuary (Adventfjorden, Svalbard). The 
      Adventelva River was a source of dissolved and particulate Hg to Adventfjorden, 
      especially in June and July during the river's main discharge period. Stable 
      isotope and fatty acid analyses suggest that zooplankton diet varied seasonally 
      with diatoms dominating during the spring phytoplankton bloom in May and with 
      increasing contributions of dinoflagellates in the summer months. In addition, 
      there was evidence of increased terrestrial carbon utilization by zooplankton in 
      June and July, when terrestrial particles contributed substantially to the 
      particulate organic matter pool. Total (TotHg) and methyl Hg (MeHg) 
      concentrations in zooplankton increased from April to August related to increased 
      exposure to riverine inputs, and to shifts in zooplankton diet and community 
      structure. Longer and warmer summer seasons will probably increase riverine 
      runoff and thus Hg exposure to Arctic zooplankton.

AB  - The adverse effects of increased nitrate (NO(3)(-)) pollution especially from the 
      non-point source on the hydrosphere and anthroposphere are becoming more 
      prominent. The non-point-derived NO(3)(-) in the rivers supplying the upstream 
      threatens the aquatic ecosystem of Taihu Lake. Here, dual-stable isotopes (δ(15)N 
      and δ(18)O) of NO(3)(-) were applied to the Bayesian model (SIAR) for 
      quantitative source identification of reactive nitrogen (Nr) in a mixed 
      agricultural and urban region along the complex river network of the Yangze River 
      delta. The results showed that the NO(3)(-) concentrations in the rivers ranged 
      from 1.09 to 4.44 mg L(-1) and decreased from the highly urbanized areas to the 
      lakeside rural areas. The specific isotopic characteristics of four sources 
      (atmospheric deposition, AD; chemical fertilizer, CF; manure and sewage, MS; and 
      soil leachate, SL) by the SIAR isotope model indicated that the MS source made 
      the greatest contribution (46.56%) to the total NO(3)(-) load, followed by SL 
      (27.86%), CF (23.77%), and AD (1.81%). The highly urbanized areas and the hybrid 
      areas, which contained a mix of industrialized, populated, and agricultural 
      areas, were identified as hotspot areas with heavy Nr pollution, responsible for 
      spatial patterns of δ(15)N-NO(3)(-) and δ(18)O-NO(3)(-). These hotspot areas were 
      characterized by a less well-developed sewage pipeline system with high Nr 
      emissions from cash crops. The changes in wastewater treatment level, the 
      agricultural production structure, and meteorological changes were the main 
      factors of spatial variation of Nr concentration and source in the upstream Taihu 
      Lake Basin. The variation in Nr concentration across Taihu Lake would respond to 
      these anthropogenic-driven Nr loads. These findings suggest that MS was the 
      predominant source had the strongest effect on the overall riverine NO(3)(-) 
      source which was the primary problem that needed to be solved.

AB  - This study evaluated the effect of growth of different tissue compartments on the 
      bioaccumulation of mercury (Hg) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Silver 
      Carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and Bighead Carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) 
      from the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), China. A non-steady state 
      bioenergetics/toxicokinetic model was developed to simulate PCB and Hg 
      concentrations in these two species and compared with field data. Simulations 
      using constant whole body growth rate and constant tissue to whole body weight 
      ratios were contrasted against simulations adopting age specific whole body and 
      tissue/age specific growth rates for their goodness of fit to field data. The 
      simulations using age/tissue specific growth rates demonstrated better fit to 
      field data for PCBs compared to the constant growth rate models (22% improved 
      R(2)), while both models explained similar variation in Hg concentration data. 
      Both species demonstrated higher growth rates of lipids (on a daily basis) 
      relative to whole body and protein contributing to higher growth dilution of PCBs 
      compared to Hg. Although stable isotope data indicated some degree of diet and/or 
      habitat shift, simulations assuming a constant diet concentration explained 
      between 36 and 40% of the variation in fish concentrations for both contaminants 
      and fish species. This study demonstrates that differences in the bioaccumulation 
      rate of PCBs and Hg by Asian carp can be partially explained by differences in 
      the growth rates of key tissue storage compartments associated with each 
      contaminant. These differences in chemical-specific growth dilution subsequently 
      contribute to differences in chemical retention and bioaccumulation patterns of 
      Hg and PCBs by fish.

TI  - Trophic niche differentiation and utilisation of food resources in Collembola is 
      altered by rainforest conversion to plantation systems.
PG  - e10971
LID - 10.7717/peerj.10971 [doi]
LID - e10971
AB  - Intensively managed monoculture plantations are increasingly replacing natural 
      forests across the tropics resulting in changes in ecological niches of species 
      and communities, and in ecosystem functioning. Collembola are among the most 
      abundant arthropods inhabiting the belowground system sensitively responding to 
      changes in vegetation and soil conditions. However, most studies on the response 
      of Collembola to land-use change were conducted in temperate ecosystems and 
      focused on shifts in community composition or morphological traits, while 
      parameters more closely linked to ecosystem functioning, such as trophic niches, 
      received little attention. Here, we used stable isotope analysis ((13)C and 
      (15)N) to investigate changes in the trophic structure and use of food resources 
      by Collembola in Jambi province (Sumatra, Indonesia), a region that experienced 
      strong deforestation in the last decades. Isotopic values of Collembola from 32 
      sites representing four land-use systems were analyzed (rainforest, rubber 
      agroforest, rubber (Hevea brasiliansis) and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) 
      monoculture plantations). Across Collembola species Δ(13)C values were highest in 
      rainforest suggesting more pronounced processing of litter resources by 
      microorganisms and consumption of these microorganisms by Collembola in this 
      system. Lower Δ(13)C values, but high Δ(13)C variation in Collembola in oil palm 
      plantations indicated that Collembola shifted towards herbivory and used more 
      variable resources in this system. Small range in Δ(15)N values in Collembola 
      species in monoculture plantations in comparison to rainforest indicated that 
      conversion of rainforest into plantations is associated with simplification in 
      the trophic structure of Collembola communities. This was further confirmed by 
      generally lower isotopic niche differentiation among species in plantations. 
      Across the studied ecosystems, atmobiotic species (Symphypleona and Paronellidae) 
      occupied the lowest, whereas euedaphic Collembola species occupied the highest 
      trophic position, resembling patterns in temperate forests. Some species of 
      Paronellidae in rainforest and jungle rubber had Δ(15)N values below those of 
      leaf litter suggesting algivory (Salina sp.1, Callyntrura sp.1 and Lepidonella 
      sp.1), while a dominant species, Pseudosinella sp.1, had the highest Δ(15)N 
      values in most of the land-use systems suggesting that this species at least in 
      part lives as predator or scavenger. Overall, the results suggest that rainforest 
      conversion into plantation systems is associated with marked shifts in the 
      structure of trophic niches in soil and litter Collembola with potential 
      consequences for ecosystem functioning and food-web stability.

AB  - Levels of mercury (Hg) and organochlorine compounds (OCs), such as PCBs and 
      p,p'-DDE, as well as the stable isotope ratios of carbon (delta 13C) and nitrogen 
      (delta 15N) were compared in Pacific bluefin, yellowfin, and albacore tuna taken 
      from the southern, central, and northern regions of Japan according to tuna 
      species and the region of origin. Levels of Hg and OCs as well as the delta 15N 
      value were the highest in the bluefin tuna, reflecting their higher trophic 
      position and longer life span. The average Hg concentrations tended to be higher 
      in specimens taken in the southern region than in the central and northern 
      regions for bluefin tuna and in the southern region than in the central region 
      for yellowfin and albacore tuna, while the levels of OCs tended to be lower in 
      the southern region except for yellowfin tuna. The spatial differences in Hg and 
      OCs levels found in the three species may reflect geographical differences in the 
      contamination of marine environment around Japan. Negative correlations between 
      delta 13C and delta 15N were found in the yellowfin and albacore tuna, probably 
      reflecting the latitudinal effect, whereas a positive correlation was found in 
      the bluefin tuna, probably reflecting a diet shift during wide-range migration.

AB  - Even at low concentrations in the environment, mercury has the potential to 
      biomagnify in food chains and reaches levels of concern in apex predators. The 
      aim of this study was to relate the transfer of total mercury (THg) and 
      methylmercury (MeHg) in a Gulf of St. Lawrence food web to the trophic structure, 
      from primary consumers to seabirds, using stable nitrogen (δ(15)N) and carbon 
      (δ(13)C) isotope analysis and physical environmental parameters. The energy 
      reaching upper trophic level species was principally derived from pelagic primary 
      production, with particulate organic matter (POM) at the base of the food chain. 
      We developed a biomagnification factor (BMF) taking into account the various prey 
      items consumed by a given predator using stable isotope mixing models. This BMF 
      provides a more realistic estimation than when using a single prey. Lipid 
      content, body weight, trophic level and benthic connection explained 77.4 and 
      80.7% of the variation in THg and MeHg concentrations, respectively in this food 
      web. When other values were held constant, relationships with lipid and benthic 
      connection were negative whereas relationships with trophic level and body weight 
      were positive. Total Hg and MeHg biomagnified in this food web with 
      biomagnification power values (slope of the relationship with δ(15)N) of 0.170 
      and 0.235, respectively on wet weight and 0.134 and 0.201, respectively on dry 
      weight. Values of biomagnification power were greater for pelagic and 
      benthopelagic species compared to benthic species whereas the opposite trend was 
      observed for levels at the base of the food chain. This suggests that Hg would be 
      readily bioavailable to organisms at the base of the benthic food chain, but 
      trophic transfer would be more efficient in each trophic level of pelagic and 
      benthopelagic food chains.

AB  - Local differences in trophic structure and composition of organic matter 
      subsidies can influence the capacity of soft sediment communities to assimilate 
      recycled organic matter from processes such as salmon farm enrichment. The 
      present study combines biochemical analysis with biomass density information on 
      soft sediment taxa collected within the depositional footprint of salmon farms 
      and at reference sites in the Marlborough Sounds, New Zealand. Distinct 
      biochemical signatures confirmed that the flux of organic matter from salmon 
      farms was an important subsidy for soft sediment communities. Isotopic modelling 
      demonstrated that the proportion of biomass supported by farm-derived organic 
      matter did not change in a consistent pattern along the 300 m gradient from each 
      farm site, whereas the average trophic level of communities decreased with 
      increasing proximity to farms. High variability in both the total biomass and the 
      distribution of biomass across trophic levels occurred among sites downstream of 
      farms and among individual farms. Consequently, estimates of basal organic matter 
      assimilation per unit area by communities differed by several orders of magnitude 
      among sites. Total organic matter assimilation tended to decrease with increasing 
      proximity to farms due to a shift towards a more detrital based community. 
      Differences in basal organic matter assimilation among farms did not appear to be 
      directly related to local flow regime, but instead was closely linked to 
      differences in the soft sediment community composition likely influenced by an 
      array of anthropogenic and environmental factors. The results presented here 
      highlight the importance of considering local variability in basal organic matter 
      source pools, and the potential for synergistic and cumulative effects to drive 
      changes in food web trophodynamics when assessing the impacts of aquaculture on 
      soft sediment communities.

AB  - Information on predator and prey distributions is integral to our understanding 
      of migratory connectivity, food web dynamics and ecosystem structure. In marine 
      systems, although large animals that return to land can be fitted with tracking 
      devices, minimum instrument sizes preclude deployments on small seabirds that may 
      nevertheless be highly abundant and hence major consumers. An increasingly 
      popular approach is to use N and C stable isotope analysis of feathers sampled at 
      colonies to provide information on distribution and trophic level for the 
      preceding, and generally little-known, nonbreeding period. Despite the burgeoning 
      of this research, there have been few attempts to verify such relationships. In 
      this study, we demonstrate a clear correspondence between isotope ratios of 
      feathers and nonbreeding distributions of seven species from South Georgia 
      tracked using loggers. This generated a rudimentary isoscape that was used to 
      infer the habitat preferences of eight other species ranging in size from storm 
      petrels to albatrosses, and which could be applied, with caveats, in other 
      studies. Differences in inferred distribution within and between species had 
      major implications for relative exposure to anthropogenic threats, including 
      climate change and fisheries. Although there were no differences in isotope 
      values between sexes in any of the smaller petrels, mean stable C (delta(13)C), 
      but not stable N isotope ratios (delta(15)N), tended to be greater in females 
      than males of the larger, and more sexually size-dimorphic species. This 
      indicates a difference in C source (distribution), rather than trophic level, and 
      a correspondence between the degree of sexual size dimorphism in 
      Procellariiformes and the level of between-sex niche segregation.

AB  - Non-native plants can impact riparian ecosystem function through diverse 
      terrestrial and aquatic pathways, with cascading effects on food webs. 
      Invasion-mediated vegetation changes can depress terrestrial arthropod 
      communities and alter arthropod flux across the aquatic-terrestrial interface. We 
      investigated the effects of a non-native woody plant, Robinia neomexicana, on 
      insect contributions to riparian songbird diets. This plant was introduced over 
      100 years ago to the Clear Creek drainage in northwestern Colorado (USA) from its 
      native range, which extends into southern Colorado. We used stable isotope 
      analysis of insects and avian feces to 1) assess whether the relative 
      contributions of aquatic- and terrestrial-derived arthropod prey differed between 
      reference sites and sites invaded by R. neomexicana, and 2) quantify the amount 
      of aquatic- and terrestrial-derived resources consumed by an insectivorous 
      songbird assemblage. Two species of insectivorous songbirds consumed more aquatic 
      insects in invaded sites compared to reference sites. This change in terrestrial- 
      and aquatic-derived prey in bird diets in response to a near-range plant invasion 
      suggests that the introduction of novel species from more distant native ranges 
      could produce similar or stronger effects. Overall, the songbird community 
      consumed approximately 34% aquatic resources, which highlights the importance of 
      these subsidies to riparian consumers. Our investigation of insect subsidies 
      demonstrates how introduced species can indirectly affect food webs and provides 
      insight into the plasticity of riparian consumer responses.

TI  - A new interpretation of Madagascar's megafaunal decline: The "Subsistence Shift 
      Hypothesis".

AB  - Fundamental disagreements remain regarding the relative importance of climate 
      change and human activities as triggers for Madagascar's Holocene megafaunal 
      extinction. We use stable isotope data from stalagmites from northwest Madagascar 
      coupled with radiocarbon and butchery records from subfossil bones across the 
      island to investigate relationships between megafaunal decline, climate change, 
      and habitat modification. Archaeological and genetic evidence support human 
      presence by 2000 years Before Common Era (BCE). Megafaunal decline was at first 
      slow; it hastened at ∼700 Common Era (CE) and peaked between 750 and 850 CE, just 
      before a dramatic vegetation transformation in the northwest that resulted in the 
      replacement of C(3) woodland habitat with C(4) grasslands, during a period of 
      heightened monsoonal activity. Cut and chop marks on subfossil lemur bones reveal 
      a shift in primary hunting targets from larger, now-extinct species prior to ∼900 
      CE, to smaller, still-extant species afterwards. By 1050 CE, megafaunal 
      populations had essentially collapsed. Neither the rapid megafaunal decline 
      beginning ∼700 CE, nor the dramatic vegetation transformation in the northwest 
      beginning ∼890 CE, was influenced by aridification. However, both roughly 
      coincide with a major transition in human subsistence on the island from 
      hunting/foraging to herding/farming. We offer a new hypothesis, which we call the 
      "Subsistence Shift Hypothesis," to explain megafaunal decline and extinction in 
      Madagascar. This hypothesis acknowledges the importance of wild-animal hunting by 
      early hunter/foragers, but more critically highlights negative impacts of the 
      shift from hunting/foraging to herding/farming, settlement by new immigrant 
      groups, and the concomitant expansion of the island's human population. The 
      interval between 700 and 900 CE, when the pace of megafaunal decline quickened 
      and peaked, coincided with this economic transition. While early megafaunal 
      decline through hunting may have helped to trigger the transition, there is 
      strong evidence that the economic shift itself hastened the crash of megafaunal 
      populations.

TI  - From wetland specialist to hand-fed generalist: shifts in diet and condition with 
      provisioning for a recently urbanized wading bird.
LID - 10.1098/rstb.2017.0100 [doi]
LID - 20170100
AB  - Many wildlife species shift their diets to use novel resources in urban areas. 
      The consequences of these shifts are not well known, and consumption of 
      reliable-but low quality-anthropogenic food may present important trade-offs for 
      wildlife health. This may be especially true for carnivorous species such as the 
      American white ibis (Eudocimus albus), a nomadic wading bird which has been 
      increasingly observed in urban parks in South Florida, USA. We tested the effects 
      of anthropogenic provisioning on consumer nutrition (i.e. dietary protein), body 
      condition and ectoparasite burdens along an urban gradient using stable isotope 
      analysis, scaled mass index values and GPS transmitter data. Ibises that 
      assimilated more provisioned food were captured at more urban sites, used more 
      urban habitat, had lower mass-length residuals, lower ectoparasite scores, 
      assimilated less δ15N and had smaller dietary isotopic ellipses. Our results 
      suggest that ibises in urban areas are heavily provisioned with anthropogenic 
      food, which appears to offer a trade-off by providing low-quality, but easily 
      accessible, calories that may not support high mass but may increase time 
      available for anti-parasite behaviours such as preening. Understanding such 
      trade-offs is important for investigating the effects of provisioning on 
      infection risk and the conservation of wildlife in human-modified habitats.This 
      article is part of the theme issue 'Anthropogenic resource subsidies and 
      host-parasite dynamics in wildlife'.

TI  - Stable isotopic characterization of nitrate wet deposition in the tropical urban

AB  - Increasing energy consumption and food production worldwide results in 
      anthropogenic emissions of reactive nitrogen into the atmosphere. To date, 
      however, little information is available on tropical urban environments where 
      inorganic nitrogen is vastly transported and deposited through precipitation on 
      terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. To fill this gap, we present compositions of 
      water stable isotopes in precipitation and atmospheric nitrate (δ(18)O-H(2)O, 
      δ(2)H-H(2)O, δ(15)N-NO(3)(-), and δ(18)O-NO(3)(-)) collected daily between August 
      2018 and November 2019 in a tropical urban atmosphere of central Costa Rica. 
      Rainfall generation processes (convective and stratiform rainfall fractions) were 
      identified using stable isotopes in precipitation coupled with air mass back 
      trajectory analysis. A Bayesian isotope mixing model using δ(15)N-NO(3)(-) 
      compositions and corrected for potential (15)N fractionation effects revealed the 
      contribution of lightning (25.9 ± 7.1%), biomass burning (21.8 ± 6.6%), gasoline 
      (19.1 ± 6.4%), diesel (18.4 ± 6.0%), and soil biogenic emissions (15.0 ± 2.6%) to 
      nitrate wet deposition. δ(18)O-NO(3)(-) values reflect the oxidation of NO(x) 
      sources via the ·OH + RO(2) pathways. These findings provide necessary baseline 
      information about the combination of water and nitrogen stable isotopes with 
      atmospheric chemistry and hydrometeorological techniques to better understand wet 
      deposition processes and to characterize the origin and magnitude of inorganic 
      nitrogen loadings in tropical regions.

AB  - The spread of C4 grasses in the late Neogene is one of the most important 
      ecological transitions of the Cenozoic, but the primary driver of this global 
      expansion is widely debated. We use the stable carbon isotopic composition 
      (δ(13)C) of bison and mammoth tissues as a proxy for the relative abundance of C3 
      and C4 vegetation in their grazing habitat to determine climatic and atmospheric 
      CO2 controls on C4 grass distributions from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the 
      present. We predict the spatial variability of grass δ(13)C in North America 
      using a mean of three different methods of classification and regression tree 
      (CART) machine learning techniques and nine climatic variables. We show that 
      growing season precipitation and temperature are the strongest predictors of all 
      single climate variables. We apply this CART analysis to high-resolution gridded 
      climate data and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) mean paleoclimate 
      model outputs to produce predictive isotope landscape models ("isoscapes") for 
      the current, mid-Holocene, and LGM average δ(13)C of grass-dominated areas across 
      North America. From the LGM to the present, C4 grass abundances substantially 
      increased in the Great Plains despite concurrent increases in atmospheric CO2. 
      These results suggest that changes in growing season precipitation rather than 
      atmospheric CO2 were critically important in the Neogene expansion of C4 grasses.

TI  - Influence of size on total mercury (THg), methyl mercury (MeHg), and stable 
      isotopes of N and C in green turtles (Chelonia mydas) from NE Brazil.

AB  - The green turtle (Chelonia mydas) is known to present an herbivorous diet as an 
      adult; however, juveniles may have an omnivore habit, and these changes in food 
      preference may affect the uptake and accumulation of pollutants, such as mercury 
      (Hg). In order to better understand the influence of this ontogenetic shift on Hg 
      accumulation, this study evaluates the concentrations of total mercury (THg), 
      methyl mercury (MeHg), and stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen (δ(13)C and 
      δ(15)N) in a group of juveniles of the green turtle. Tissue samples (liver, 
      kidney, muscle, and scutes) were sampled from 47 turtles stranded dead on the 
      coast of Bahia, NE, Brazil, between 2009 and 2013. The turtles analyzed showed a 
      size range of 24.9-62.0 cm and an average of 36.4 ± 7.2 cm of curved carapace 
      length. The scutes showed to be a viable method for Hg monitoring in the green 
      turtles. The concentrations of THg and MeHg decreased with increasing size. The 
      isotope values of δ(15)N and δ(13)C did not show a clear relationship with the 
      size, suggesting that the green turtles used in our work would be occupying 
      similar trophic levels, and foraging habitat.

TI  - Stable isotopes reveal Holocene changes in the diet of Adélie penguins in 
      Northern Victoria Land (Ross Sea, Antarctica).
PG  - 911-9
LID - 10.1007/s00442-010-1790-2 [doi]
AB  - Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) modern and fossil eggshells and guano samples 
      collected from ornithogenic soils in Terra Nova Bay (Victoria Land, Ross Sea) 
      were processed for carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios with the aim of detecting 
      past penguin dietary changes. A detailed and greatly expanded Adélie penguin 
      dietary record dated back to 7,200 years BP has been reconstructed for the 
      investigated area. Our data indicate a significant dietary shift between fish and 
      krill, with a gradual decrease from past to present time in the proportion of 
      fish compared to krill in Adélie penguin diet. From 7,200 to 2,000 years BP, 
      δ(13)C and δ(15)N values indicate fish as the most eaten prey. The dietary 
      contribution of lower-trophic prey in penguin diet started becoming evident not 
      earlier than 2,000 years BP, when the δ(13)C values reveal a change in the 
      penguin feeding behavior. Modern eggshell and guano samples reveal a major 
      dietary contribution of krill but not a krill-dominated diet, since δ(13)C values 
      remain much too high if krill prevail in the diet. According to the Holocene 
      environmental background attested for Victoria Land, Adélie penguin dietary 
      shifts between fish and krill seem to reflect penguin paleoecological responses 
      to different paleoenvironmental settings with different conditions of sea-ice 
      extension and persistence. Furthermore, Adélie penguin diet appears to be 
      particularly affected by environmental changes in a very specific period within 
      the breeding season, namely the egg-laying period when penguin dietary and 
      feeding habit shifts are clearly documented by the δ(13)C of eggshell carbonate.

TI  - Beyond cool: adapting upland streams for climate change using riparian woodlands.
PG  - 310-24
LID - 10.1111/gcb.13103 [doi]
AB  - Managed adaptation could reduce the risks of climate change to the world's 
      ecosystems, but there have been surprisingly few practical evaluations of the 
      options available. For example, riparian woodland is advocated widely as shade to 
      reduce warming in temperate streams, but few studies have considered collateral 
      effects on species composition or ecosystem functions. Here, we use 
      cross-sectional analyses at two scales (region and within streams) to investigate 
      whether four types of riparian management, including those proposed to reduce 
      potential climate change impacts, might also affect the composition, functional 
      character, dynamics and energetic resourcing of macroinvertebrates in upland 
      Welsh streams (UK). Riparian land use across the region had only small effects on 
      invertebrate taxonomic composition, while stable isotope data showed how 
      energetic resources assimilated by macroinvertebrates in all functional guilds 
      were split roughly 50:50 between terrestrial and aquatic origins irrespective of 
      riparian management. Nevertheless, streams draining the most extensive deciduous 
      woodland had the greatest stocks of coarse particulate matter (CPOM) and greater 
      numbers of 'shredding' detritivores. Stream-scale investigations showed that 
      macroinvertebrate biomass in deciduous woodland streams was around twice that in 
      moorland streams, and lowest of all in streams draining non-native conifers. The 
      unexpected absence of contrasting terrestrial signals in the isotopic data 
      implies that factors other than local land use affect the relative incorporation 
      of allochthonous subsidies into riverine food webs. Nevertheless, our results 
      reveal how planting deciduous riparian trees along temperate headwaters as an 
      adaptation to climate change can modify macroinvertebrate function, increase 
      biomass and potentially enhance resilience by increasing basal resources where 
      cover is extensive (>60 m riparian width). We advocate greater urgency in efforts 
      to understand the ecosystem consequences of climate change adaptation to guide 
      future actions.

AB  - Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis was carried out on pelagic fishery 
      organisms caught in light traps and falling nets in the central and western South 
      China Sea in the spring of 2018. The stable isotope values of the sampled 
      individuals were used to elucidate the isotopic variations for the pelagic 
      fishery organisms, to classify species into trophic functional groups, and to 
      compare the differences of trophic structure among the classified trophic 
      functional groups. The results showed that among 23 fishery species the mean 
      δ(13)C value of Coryphaena hippurus was the lowest (-17.58‰±0.21‰), and that of 
      Grammistes sexlineatus was the highest (-19.86‰±0.33‰). The mean δ(15)N values 
      ranged from 8.31‰ in Psenes cyanophrys to (12.46±0.74)‰ in Chirocentrus dorab. 
      The continuous trophic spectrum indicated that the trophic level (TL) for the 
      sampled pela-gic fishery organisms ranged from 3.01 to 4.23, of which 19 species 
      (83% of the total) fell between TL 3.0 and 4.0. The 23 species of fishery 
      organisms were classified into three trophic functional groups, i.e., plankton 
      feeding functional group (PFFG), nekton feeding functional group (NFFG), and 
      mixed feeding functional group (MFFG). The analysis of standard ellipse area 
      (SEA) showed that the PFFG occupied the largest trophic niche width 
      (SEA=1.56‰(2)), followed by the MFFG (SEA=0.99‰(2)) and NFFG (SEA=0.31‰(2)). The 
      MFFG overlapped with PFFG and NFFG in the trophic niche, with a relative 
      percentage of 17% and 26%, respectively. There was no overlap between PFFG and 
      NFFG.

      microbial communities.
PG  - 1825-1835
LID - 10.1038/ismej.2017.48 [doi]
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) stocks contain nearly three times as much carbon (C) as 
      the atmosphere and changes in soil C stocks may have a major impact on future 
      atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and climate. Over the past two decades, 
      much research has been devoted to examining the influence of warming on SOM 
      decomposition in topsoil. Most SOM, however, is old and stored in subsoil. The 
      fate of subsoil SOM under future warming remains highly uncertain. Here, by 
      combining a long-term field warming experiment and a meta-analysis study, we 
      showed that warming significantly increased SOM decomposition in subsoil. We also 
      showed that a decade of warming promoted decomposition of subsoil SOM with 
      turnover times of decades to millennia in a tall grass prairie and this effect 
      was largely associated with shifts in the functional gene structure of microbial 
      communities. By coupling stable isotope probing with metagenomics, we found that 
      microbial communities in warmed soils possessed a higher relative abundance of 
      key functional genes involved in the degradation of organic materials with 
      varying recalcitrance than those in control soils. These findings suggest warming 
      may considerably alter the stability of the vast pool of old SOM in subsoil, 
      contributing to the long-term positive feedback between the C cycle and climate.

TI  - Accumulation of atmospheric and sedimentary PCBs and toxaphene in a Lake Michigan 
      food web.
PG  - 3287-93
AB  - Seston, sediment, settling organic matter, and food web members were collected 
      from Grand Traverse Bay, Lake Michigan, between April 1997 and September 1998 to 
      examine PCB and toxaphene biomagnification. Stable isotopes of nitrogen and 
      carbon were analyzed in samples and used to establish trophic structure of the 
      food web and to determine the importance of atmospheric versus sedimentary 
      sources in delivering PCBs to the food web. Nitrogen isotopes were confounded by 
      multiple variables in this system, particularly seasonal variation, and did not 
      display a simple pattern of enrichment among trophic levels. However, delta13C 
      displayed little seasonal variation and was positively correlated with PCB 
      concentrations among food web members (r2 = 0.69). Plots of delta13C vs PCBs 
      separate food web members into three distinct groupings comprised of 
      invertebrates, primary forage fish, and predatory fish. Stable isotope values of 
      the primary organic sources indicate that the atmosphere, and not the sediment, 
      is the most likely source of PCBs to the food web of Lake Michigan. Additionally, 
      we suggest that seston may be important in delivering PCBs to pelagic food web 
      members and species that receive a majority of their nutrition through pelagic 
      sources. In contrast, settling particles are implicated in delivering PCBs to 
      benthic organisms and Mysis relicta.

AB  - Concentrations of non-polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) brominated 
      (hexabromocyclododecane [HBCD], 1,2-bis[2,4,6-tribromophenoxy]ethane [BTBPE], and 
      pentabromoethylbenzene [PEB]) and chlorinated (Dechlorane Plus [DP] as well as 
      short- and medium-chain chlorinated paraffins [SCCP and MCCP, respectively]) 
      flame retardants were evaluated in archived Lake Ontario, Canada, lake trout 
      (Salvelinus namaycush) samples collected between 1979 and 2004. Polybrominated 
      diphenyl ethers also were analyzed to provide a point of reference for comparison 
      to previous studies. Concentrations of the dominant PBDE congeners (BDEs 28, 47, 
      99, 100, 153, and 154) increased significantly from 1979 until the mid-1990s, 
      then either leveled off or decreased significantly between 1998 and 2004, a 
      result that corresponds to those of previous studies. In contrast, BDE 209 
      increased approximately fourfold between 1998 and 2004. The temporal trends of 
      the non-PBDE flame retardants varied, with sum (sigma) HBCD and DP showing 
      significant overall decreases; BTBPE, sigmaSCCP, and sigmaMCCP showing parabolic 
      trends; and PEB showing no overall change during the study period. Because many 
      of the non-PBDE chemicals may be used as replacements for penta- and octa-BDE 
      mixtures, these results will provide a baseline to evaluate future usage 
      patterns. Possible changes in food-web structure, evaluated through stable 
      nitrogen isotopes (delta15N), may be influencing our interpretations of 
      contaminant trends in lake trout and are hypothesized to be partially responsible 
      for the observed decrease in concentrations of BDEs 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, and 154 
      between 1998 and 2004. Retrospective analyses evaluating temporal trends in 
      stable isotope values at the base of the food web, however, are recommended to 
      test this hypothesis further.

TI  - Grassland harvesting alters ant community trophic structure: An isotopic study in 
      tallgrass prairies.
PG  - 9815-9826
LID - 10.1002/ece3.5523 [doi]
AB  - Disturbances have long been recognized as important forces for structuring 
      natural communities but their effects on trophic structure are not well 
      understood, particularly in terrestrial systems. This is in part because 
      quantifying trophic linkages is a challenge, especially for small organisms with 
      cryptic feeding behaviors such as insects, and often relies on conducting 
      labor-intensive feeding trials or extensive observations in the field. In this 
      study, we used stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen to examine how disturbance 
      (annual biomass harvesting) in tallgrass prairies affected the trophic position, 
      trophic range, and niche space of ants, a widespread grassland consumer. We 
      hypothesized that biomass harvest would remove important food and nesting 
      resources of insects thus affecting ant feeding relationships and trophic 
      structure. We found shifts in the feeding relationships inferred by isotopic 
      signatures with harvest. In particular, these shifts suggest that ants within 
      harvest sites utilized resources at lower trophic levels (possibly plant-based 
      resources or herbivores), expanded trophic breadth, and occupied different niche 
      spaces. Shifts in resource use following harvest could be due to harvest-mediated 
      changes in both the plant and arthropod communities that might affect the 
      strength of competition or alter plant nitrogen availability. Because shifts in 
      resource use alter the flow of nutrients across the food web, disturbance effects 
      on ants could have ecosystem-level consequences through nutrient cycling.

AB  - To quantify maternal provisioning of nutrients in the pelagic thresher shark 
      (Alopias pelagicus) and the potential for negative impacts, the concentrations of 
      trace elements (essential: Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Se, and Zn; nonessential: As, Ba, 
      Cd, Hg, and Pb) and fractionation of stable isotopes ((13)C and (15)N) were 
      analyzed in the muscle and liver of 10 pregnant females and 18 associated 
      embryos. Essential trace elements were observed to be offloaded at higher 
      concentrations to embryos, with the exception of Zn and Ni in liver, while 
      nonessential trace elements were unevenly distributed between maternal-embryo 
      tissues. Observed Hg concentrations were at levels considered toxic in A. 
      pelagicus, but the Se: Hg molar ratios in all embryonic tissues were all greater 
      than one. A negative correlation was observed between transfer ratios and 
      concentrations of all elements in maternal tissue, indicating the existence of a 
      regulatory mechanism in maternal ovaries of A. pelagicus. Compared with maternal 
      specimens, associated embryos had higher δ(13)C and δ(15)N values in muscle and 
      liver tissue. Negative correlations were observed between δ(13)C, δ(15)N, and 
      Δδ(13)C values and precaudal length in embryonic muscle tissue potentially 
      reflecting either a dietary-habitat shift in pregnant females during the latter 
      period of gestation or a physiological change modifying fractionation. Higher 
      concentrations of essential elements are linked to potential benefits for embryos 
      during early development, levels of Hg suggested a degree of anthropogenic impact 
      with unknown consequences while the directionality of isotopic fractionation 
      could suggest a potential reproductive migration as a protective mechanism for 
      birthing.

TI  - Keratin decomposition by trogid beetles: evidence from a feeding experiment and 
      stable isotope analysis.
PG  - 187-96
LID - 10.1007/s00114-013-1137-z [doi]
AB  - The decomposition of vertebrate carcasses is an important ecosystem function. 
      Soft tissues of dead vertebrates are rapidly decomposed by diverse animals. 
      However, decomposition of hard tissues such as hairs and feathers is much slower 
      because only a few animals can digest keratin, a protein that is concentrated in 
      hairs and feathers. Although beetles of the family Trogidae are considered 
      keratin feeders, their ecological function has rarely been explored. Here, we 
      investigated the keratin-decomposition function of trogid beetles in 
      heron-breeding colonies where keratin was frequently supplied as feathers. Three 
      trogid species were collected from the colonies and observed feeding on heron 
      feathers under laboratory conditions. We also measured the nitrogen (δ(15)N) and 
      carbon (δ(13)C) stable isotope ratios of two trogid species that were maintained 
      on a constant diet (feathers from one heron individual) during 70 days under 
      laboratory conditions. We compared the isotopic signatures of the trogids with 
      the feathers to investigate isotopic shifts from the feathers to the consumers 
      for δ(15)N and δ(13)C. We used mixing models (MixSIR and SIAR) to estimate the 
      main diets of individual field-collected trogid beetles. The analysis indicated 
      that heron feathers were more important as food for trogid beetles than were soft 
      tissues under field conditions. Together, the feeding experiment and stable 
      isotope analysis provided strong evidence of keratin decomposition by trogid 
      beetles.

      invasive rats.

AB  - Biotic connectivity between ecosystems can provide major transport of organic 
      matter and nutrients, influencing ecosystem structure and productivity(1), yet 
      the implications are poorly understood owing to human disruptions of natural 
      flows(2). When abundant, seabirds feeding in the open ocean transport large 
      quantities of nutrients onto islands, enhancing the productivity of island fauna 
      and flora(3,4). Whether leaching of these nutrients back into the sea influences 
      the productivity, structure and functioning of adjacent coral reef ecosystems is 
      not known. Here we address this question using a rare natural experiment in the 
      Chagos Archipelago, in which some islands are rat-infested and others are 
      rat-free. We found that seabird densities and nitrogen deposition rates are 760 
      and 251 times higher, respectively, on islands where humans have not introduced 
      rats. Consequently, rat-free islands had substantially higher nitrogen stable 
      isotope (δ(15)N) values in soils and shrubs, reflecting pelagic nutrient sources. 
      These higher values of δ(15)N were also apparent in macroalgae, filter-feeding 
      sponges, turf algae and fish on adjacent coral reefs. Herbivorous damselfish on 
      reefs adjacent to the rat-free islands grew faster, and fish communities had 
      higher biomass across trophic feeding groups, with 48% greater overall biomass. 
      Rates of two critical ecosystem functions, grazing and bioerosion, were 3.2 and 
      3.8 times higher, respectively, adjacent to rat-free islands. Collectively, these 
      results reveal how rat introductions disrupt nutrient flows among pelagic, island 
      and coral reef ecosystems. Thus, rat eradication on oceanic islands should be a 
      high conservation priority as it is likely to benefit terrestrial ecosystems and 
      enhance coral reef productivity and functioning by restoring seabird-derived 
      nutrient subsidies from large areas of ocean.

TI  - Trophic resources and mercury exposure of two silvertip shark populations in the 
      Northeast Pacific Ocean.

AB  - Worldwide shark populations have experienced rapid declines over the last 
      decades, mainly due to overfishing. Marine protected areas (MPAs) have thus 
      become an indispensable tool for the protection of these marine predators. Two 
      recently-created MPAs in the Northeast Pacific Ocean, the Revillagigedo National 
      Park and Clipperton Atoll, are characterized by different trophic structures 
      potentially influencing the trophic niche and contaminant exposure of resident 
      sharks in these two sites. In this context, we used carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen 
      (δ(15)N) stable isotope analyzes as well as total mercury concentrations ([THg]) 
      to assess the effect of foraging site on the trophic niche and Hg levels of 
      juvenile silvertip (ST) sharks Carcharhinus albimarginatus. Analyzing fin clip 
      samples from Revillagigedo and Clipperton, we found that shark δ(15)N varied 
      spatially in relation to δ(15)N baselines, suggesting similar trophic position in 
      both MPAs. Moreover, δ(13)C values indicated that ST sharks from Revillagigedo 
      would feed on different food webs (i.e. both benthic and pelagic) while 
      individuals from Clipperton would only rely on benthic food webs. These 
      differences between MPAs led to a weak overlap of isotopic niches between the two 
      populations, highlighting the site residency of juvenile ST sharks. Within each 
      population, [THg] was not correlated with trophic tracers (δ(15)N and δ(13)C) and 
      was also similar between populations. This study revealed no influence of site or 
      food web in [THg] and raises the question of the origin of Hg exposure for reef 
      shark populations in the Northeast Pacific Ocean.

TI  - Changes in fish diets and food web mercury bioaccumulation induced by an invasive 
      planktivorous fish.
PG  - A213-26
AB  - The invasion, boom, collapse, and reestablishment of a population of the 
      planktivorous threadfin shad in Clear Lake, California, USA, were documented over 
      a 20-year period, as were the effects of changing shad populations on diet and 
      mercury (Hg) bioaccumulation in nearshore fishes. Threadfin shad competitively 
      displaced other planktivorous fish in the lake, such as inland silversides, 
      young-of-year (YOY) largemouth bass, and YOY bluegill, by reducing zooplankton 
      abundance. As a result, all three species shifted from a diet that was dominated 
      by zooplankton to one that was almost entirely zoobenthos. Stable carbon isotopes 
      corroborated this pattern with each species becoming enriched in delta13C, which 
      is elevated in benthic vs. pelagic organisms. Concomitant with these changes, Hg 
      concentrations increased by approximately 50% in all three species. In contrast, 
      obligate benthivores such as prickly sculpin showed no relationship between diet 
      or delta13C and the presence of threadfin shad, suggesting that effects of the 
      shad were not strongly linked to the benthic fish community. There were also no 
      changes in Hg concentrations of prickly sculpin. The temporary extirpation of 
      threadfin shad from the lake resulted in zooplankton densities, foraging 
      patterns, isotope ratios, and Hg concentrations in pelagic fishes returning to 
      pre-shad values. These results indicate that even transient perturbations of the 
      structure of freshwater food webs can result in significant alterations in the 
      bioaccumulation of Hg and that food webs in lakes can be highly resilient.

AB  - Urban development in coastal settings has increased the input of nitrogen into 
      estuaries globally, in many cases changing the composition of estuarine 
      ecosystems. By focussing on three adjacent estuaries with a gradient of 
      anthropogenic N loadings, we used stable isotopes of N and C to test for changes 
      due to increased anthropogenic N input on the structure of some key trophic 
      linkages in estuaries. We found a consistent enrichment in δ(15)N corresponding 
      to increased anthropogenic N at the three ecosystem levels studied: fine benthic 
      organic matter, grazing invertebrate, and planktivorous fish. The degree of 
      enrichment in δ(15)N between fine benthic organic matter and the grapsid crab 
      Parasesarma erythrodactyla was identical across the three sites. The glassfish 
      Ambassis jacksoniensis showed lower levels of enrichment compared to basal food 
      sources at the higher N-loaded sites, suggesting a possible effect of 
      anthropogenic N in decreasing food-chain length in these estuaries.

TI  - Can heat waves change the trophic role of the world's most invasive crayfish? 
      Diet shifts in Procambarus clarkii.
PG  - e0183108

LID - e0183108
AB  - In the Mediterranean basin, the globally increasing temperatures are expected to 
      be accompanied by longer heat waves. Commonly assumed to benefit cold-limited 
      invasive alien species, these climatic changes may also change their feeding 
      preferences, especially in the case of omnivorous ectotherms. We investigated 
      heat wave effects on diet choice, growth and energy reserves in the invasive red 
      swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. In laboratory experiments, we fed juvenile 
      and adult crayfish on animal, plant or mixed diets and exposed them to a short or 
      a long heat wave. We then measured crayfish survival, growth, body reserves and 
      Fulton's condition index. Diet choices of the crayfish maintained on the mixed 
      diet were estimated using stable isotopes (13C and 15N). The results suggest a 
      decreased efficiency of carnivorous diets at higher temperatures, as juveniles 
      fed on the animal diet were unable to maintain high growth rates in the long heat 
      wave; and a decreased efficiency of herbivorous diets at lower temperatures, as 
      juveniles in the cold accumulated less body reserves when fed on the plant diet. 
      Heat wave treatments increased the assimilation of plant material, especially in 
      juveniles, allowing them to sustain high growth rates in the long heat wave. 
      Contrary to our expectations, crayfish performance decreased in the long heat 
      wave, suggesting that Mediterranean summer heat waves may have negative effects 
      on P. clarkii and that they are unlikely to boost its populations in this region. 
      Although uncertain, it is possible that the greater assimilation of the plant 
      diet resulted from changes in crayfish feeding preferences, raising the 
      hypotheses that i) heat waves may change the predominant impacts of this keystone 
      species and ii) that by altering species' trophic niches, climate change may 
      alter the main impacts of invasive alien species.

AB  - Mercury is a neurotoxic pollutant and contamination in remote ecosystems due to 
      atmospheric mercury deposition coupled with watershed characteristics that 
      influence mercury bioavailability. Biological interactions that affect mercury 
      bioaccumulation are especially relevant as fish assemblages change in response to 
      species introductions and lake management practices. We studied the influence of 
      shifting food web dynamics on mercury in fisheries of Little Moose Lake in the 
      southwestern Adirondack Mountains of New York, USA. Annual removal of non-native 
      Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus dolomieu) has been used as a management strategy 
      since 2000 to restore the native fish assemblage and food web in favor of Lake 
      Trout (Salvelinus namaycush). Changes in total mercury, stable carbon 
      ((13)C/(12)C) and nitrogen ((15)N/(14)N) isotopes, and growth were evaluated for 
      Lake Trout and Smallmouth Bass. Growth rates increased for both predators and 
      trophic position increased for Lake Trout post-removal. Mercury concentrations in 
      Lake Trout increased over the 16-year study period influenced by a diet shift 
      from invertebrates to higher trophic level prey fish, regardless of increased 
      growth. Smallmouth Bass mercury concentrations decreased with compensatory growth 
      from a reduced population size. These contrasting trends indicate that changes in 
      mercury deposition were not the primary driver for mercury bioaccumulation 
      responses in Little Moose Lake. Stable isotope values changed for both predators 
      and for several lower trophic level organisms, likely reflecting changes in 
      nutrient cycling and/or inputs. Our findings emphasize the potential role of 
      fisheries management on whole-lake and predatory fish responses to mercury 
      contamination in temperate lakes.

TI  - Variation in trophic niches of oribatid mites in temperate forest ecosystems as 
      indicated by neutral lipid fatty acid patterns.
PG  - 103-115
LID - 10.1007/s10493-020-00494-2 [doi]
AB  - Shifting of trophic niches of soil microarthropods may allow them to adapt to 
      changing resource conditions as induced by global change processes. However, the 
      capability of microarthropods to shift their trophic niches is little studied. 
      Whereas some studies based on stable isotopes ((15)N/(13)C) point to distinct and 
      narrow trophic niches, others indicate that trophic niches are plastic. Here, we 
      investigated shifts in trophic niches of oribatid mites (Oribatida, Acari), a 
      major soil detritivore microarthropod group, due to forest management, i.e., 
      plantation of beech and spruce forests in Central Europe, using neutral lipid 
      fatty acid (NLFA) markers. Due to differential microbial communities, we expected 
      a fungi-based diet of oribatid mites in beech forest, but more bacterial 
      contributions to the diet in spruce forest. Supporting these hypotheses, NLFA 
      markers indicated that the trophic niches of each of the studied oribatid mite 
      species differed between beech and spruce forests and shifted from feeding 
      predominantly on litter and fungi in beech forest to more intensively feeding on 
      bacteria in spruce forest. Oribatid mite species with the most pronounced 
      differences in trophic niches included Achipteria coleoptrata, Eupelops hirtus, 
      Eupelops plicatus and Liacarus xylariae, which had been classified as primary or 
      secondary decomposers in previous studies. Overall, the results indicate that the 
      ability of oribatid mite species to colonize different habitats and ecosystems is 
      due to their ability to adjust their diet, i.e., to trophic plasticity. Changes 
      in trophic niches in each of the studied oribatid mite species suggest that 
      detritivores in soil may better cope with future changes in environmental 
      conditions and associated changes in resource composition than species above the 
      ground.

TI  - Stable carbon isotope composition of perirenal adipose tissue fatty acids from 
      Engadine sheep grazing either mountain or lowland pasture.
PG  - 905-13
LID - 10.2527/jas.2011-4284 [doi]
AB  - To provide further insights into ruminant lipid digestion and metabolism, and 
      into cis-9,trans-11 18:2 synthesis, 12 growing Engadine lambs grazing either 
      mountain pasture (2,250 m above sea level; n = 6) or lowland pasture (400 m above 
      sea level; n = 6) were studied. Both pastures consisted exclusively of C(3) 
      plants. Before the experiment, all animals grazed a common pasture for 6 wk. 
      Grasses and perirenal adipose tissues of the sheep were analyzed for fatty acids 
      by gas chromatography. Stable C-isotope ratios (δ(13)C values in ‰ vs. the Vienna 
      Pee Dee Belemnite standard) were determined in the composite samples by elemental 
      analysis-isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The δ(13)C of the individual fatty 
      acids were measured by gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass 
      spectrometry. The δ(13)C value of the entire mountain pasture grass was -27.5‰ 
      (SD 0.31), whereas that of the lowland pasture grass was -30.0‰ (SD 0.07). This 
      difference was reflected in the perirenal adipose tissues of the corresponding 
      sheep (P < 0.05), even though the δ(13)C values were less in the animals than in 
      the grass. The δ(13)C values for cis-9 16:1 and cis-9 18:1 in perirenal fat 
      differed between mountain and lowland lambs (P < 0.05). The 16:0 in the adipose 
      tissue was enriched in (13)C by 5‰ compared with the dietary 16:0, likely as a 
      result of partly endogenous synthesis. The δ(13)C values of cis-9,trans-11 18:2 
      (cis-9,trans-11 CLA) in the adipose tissue were smaller than those of its dietary 
      precursors, cis-9,cis-12 18:2 and cis-9,cis-12,cis-15 18:3; conversely, the 
      δ(13)C values of trans-11 18:1 were not, suggesting that large proportions of 
      perirenal cis-9,trans-11 18:2 were of endogenous origin and discrimination 
      against (13)C occurred during Δ(9)-desaturation. The same discrimination was 
      indicated by the isotopic shift between 16:0 and cis-9 16:1 in the mountain 
      grazing group. Furthermore, the δ(13)C values of cis-9,trans-11 18:2 were smaller 
      relative to the precursor fatty acids in the mountain lambs compared with the 
      lowland group. This result suggests a reduced extent of biohydrogenation in lambs 
      grazing on mountain grass in comparison with those grazing on lowland grass. This 
      was supported by the smaller cis-9,trans-11 18:2 concentrations in total fatty 
      acids found in the adipose tissues of the lowland lambs (P < 0.001). The results 
      of this study demonstrate that natural differences between δ(13)C values of 
      swards from different pastures and the adipose tissue fatty acids could be used 
      as tracers in studies of lipid metabolism in ruminants.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) concentrations and stable isotopes along with other trace metals 
      were examined in environmental samples from Ecuador and Peru's shared 
      Puyango-Tumbes River in order to determine the extent to which artisanal- and 
      small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in Portovelo-Zaruma, Ecuador contributes to Hg 
      pollution in the downstream aquatic ecosystem. Prior studies investigated the 
      relationship between ASGM activities and downstream Hg pollution relying 
      primarily on Hg concentration data. In this study, Hg isotopes revealed an 
      isotopically heavy Hg signature with negligible mass independent fractionation 
      (MIF) in downstream sediments, which was consistent with the signature observed 
      in the ASGM source endmember. This signature was traced as far as ∼120 km 
      downstream of Portovelo-Zaruma, demonstrating that Hg stable isotopes can be used 
      as a tool to fingerprint and trace sources of Hg over vast distances in 
      freshwater environments. The success of Hg isotopes as a source tracer in fresh 
      waters is largely due to the particle-reactive nature of Hg. Furthermore, the 
      magnitude and extent of downstream Hg, lead, copper and zinc contamination 
      coupled with the Hg isotopes suggest that it is unlikely that the smaller 
      artisanal-scale activities, which do not use cyanidation, are responsible for the 
      pollution. More likely it is the scale of ores processed and the cyanide 
      leaching, which can release other metals and enhance Hg transport, used during 
      small-scale gold mining that is responsible. Thus, although artisanal- and 
      small-scale gold mining occur in tandem in Portovelo-Zaruma, a distinction should 
      be made between these two activities.

TI  - Biomagnification of organochlorine pollutants in farmed and wild gilthead sea 
      bream (Sparus aurata) and stable isotope characterization of the trophic chains.
PG  - 340-9
AB  - Organochlorine pollutants (pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls) were 
      analysed in farmed and wild gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) tissues (white 
      muscle and liver) from the Western Mediterranean (Spain) and in their diets. 
      Determination was carried out by gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass 
      spectrometry after clean up of the fatty extracts by normal phase HPLC, with 
      detection limits around 0.1 ng/g. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios were 
      also determined in the samples. Organochlorine compounds concentration was found 
      to be uniform throughout the year in farmed fish, in both white muscle and liver. 
      In contrast, wild fish showed contamination profiles that reflect environmental 
      factors and the biological cycle. Although biomagnification factors for white 
      muscle and liver were found to be 2.4 and 3.0, respectively for farmed fish, and 
      0.15 and 0.54 for wild specimens, wild fish presented higher levels of 
      organochlorine contaminants than farmed fish. Nitrogen stable isotopes 
      determination in muscle from wild and farmed sea bream during the year gave us a 
      profile related to the biological cycle. delta(15)N mean values from farmed fish 
      were 2.0 per thousand higher than from wild fish throughout the year that 
      corresponding to close to one trophic step. delta(13)C values were stable during 
      the year, and also more enriched in the case of farmed fish. The low levels of 
      contaminants found in the feed supplied to farmed fish explain the organochlorine 
      concentrations in their tissues which remain below wild fish, in spite of the 
      intensive culture conditions and higher trophic level of cultured specimens.

AB  - Climate change and the intensification of land use practices are causing 
      widespread eutrophication of subarctic lakes. The implications of this rapid 
      change for lake ecosystem function remain poorly understood. To assess how 
      freshwater communities respond to such profound changes in their habitat and 
      resource availability, we conducted a space-for-time analysis of food-web 
      structure in 30 lakes situated across a temperature-productivity gradient 
      equivalent to the predicted future climate of subarctic Europe (temperature +3°C, 
      precipitation +30% and nutrient +45 μg L(-1) total phosphorus). Along this 
      gradient, we observed an increase in the assimilation of pelagic-derived carbon 
      from 25 to 75% throughout primary, secondary and tertiary consumers. This shift 
      was overwhelmingly driven by the consumption of pelagic detritus by benthic 
      primary consumers and was not accompanied by increased pelagic foraging by higher 
      trophic level consumers. Our data also revealed a convergence of the carbon 
      isotope ratios of pelagic and benthic food web endmembers in the warmest, most 
      productive lakes indicating that the incorporation of terrestrial derived carbon 
      into aquatic food webs increases as land use intensifies. These results, 
      reflecting changes along a gradient characteristic of the predicted future 
      environment throughout the subarctic, indicate that climate and land use driven 
      eutrophication and browning are radically altering the function and fuelling of 
      aquatic food webs in this biome.

AB  - The feeding ecology and ontogeny of a large size range of brown trout Salmo 
      trutta in Lake Fyresvatnet, southern Norway, were examined by stomach content and 
      stable isotope analyses. According to the stomach contents, the S. trutta changed 
      their diet at c. 30 cm total length (L(T) ). The smaller size classes fed on 
      benthic invertebrates and surface insects, whereas larger S. trutta (>30 cm) fed 
      mainly on whitefish Coregonus lavaretus. A similar, but more gradual shift to 
      piscivory in the size range 25-30 cm was found when using the stable isotope 
      mixing model SIAR to reveal dietary ontogeny. The δ¹³C isotopic signature 
      confirmed that S. trutta independent of size predominantly relied upon benthic 
      energy sources, suggesting that the littoral zone was the primary foraging 
      habitat for both invertebrate and piscivorous feeders. The δ¹⁵N values and 
      trophic position increased with predator length, ranging from an average of 3·60 
      for small-sized S. trutta (<15 cm) to 4·15 for large-sized fish (>35 cm). The S. 
      trutta exhibited a relatively slow growth rate during the predominant 
      invertebrate feeding stages up to 7 years of age and 28 cm L(T) , whereas fish 
      above this size and age displayed a rapid growth rate of 9-11 cm year⁻¹, 
      demonstrating the profitability of piscivorous feeding.

TI  - Terrestrial-aquatic linkage in stream food webs along a forest chronosequence: 
      multi-isotopic evidence.
PG  - 1146-58
AB  - Long-term monitoring of ecosystem succession provides baseline data for 
      conservation and management, as well as for understanding the dynamics of 
      underlying biogeochemical processes. We examined the effects of deforestation and 
      subsequent afforestation of a riparian forest of Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria 
      japonica) on stable isotope ratios of carbon (δ¹³C) and nitrogen (δ¹⁵N) and 
      natural abundances of radiocarbon (Δ¹⁴C) in stream biota in the Mt. Gomadan 
      Experimental Forest and the Wakayama Forest Research Station, Kyoto University, 
      central Japan. Macroinvertebrates, periphytic algae attached to rock surfaces 
      (periphyton), and leaf litter of terrestrial plants were collected from six 
      headwater streams with similar climate, topography, and bedrock geology, except 
      for the stand ages of riparian forests (from 3 to 49 yr old in five stands and > 
      90 yr old in one reference stand). Light intensity and δ¹³C values of both 
      periphyton and macroinvertebrates decreased synchronously with forest age in 
      winter. A Bayesian mixing model indicates that periphyton contributions to the 
      stream food webs are maximized in 23-yr-old forests. Except for grazers, most 
      macroinvertebrates showed Δ¹⁴C values similar to those of terrestrial leaf 
      litter, reflecting the influence of modern atmospheric CO₂ Δ¹⁴C values. On the 
      other hand, the Δ¹⁴C values of both periphyton and grazers (i.e., aquatic primary 
      consumers) were significantly lower than that of modern atmospheric CO₂, and were 
      lowest in 23-yr-old forest stands. Previous studies show that root biomass of C. 
      japonica peaks at 15-30 yr after planting. These evidences suggest that soil CO₂ 
      released by root respiration and dispersed by groundwater weathers carbonate 
      substrata, and that dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) with low Δ¹⁴C is 
      incorporated into stream periphyton and some macroinvertebrates. The ecological 
      response in the studied streams to clear-cutting and replanting of Japanese cedar 
      is much slower (~20 yr) than the chemical response (< 5 yr). More than 50 yr is 
      required for the food web structure to completely recover from clear-cutting. The 
      ecological delay is attributed to several biogeochemical factors, the 
      understanding of which is critical to integrated management of forest-stream 
      continuum and the prediction of ecosystem resilience in response to environmental 
      change.

TI  - The structure of salt marsh soil mesofauna food webs - The prevalence of

PG  - e0189645

LID - e0189645
AB  - Mesofauna taxa fill key trophic positions in soil food webs, even in 
      terrestrial-marine boundary habitats characterized by frequent natural 
      disturbances. Salt marshes represent such boundary habitats, characterized by 
      frequent inundations increasing from the terrestrial upper to the marine pioneer 
      zone. Despite the high abundance of soil mesofauna in salt marshes and their 
      important function by facilitating energy and carbon flows, the structure, 
      trophic ecology and habitat-related diet shifts of mesofauna species in natural 
      salt marsh habitats is virtually unknown. Therefore, we investigated the effects 
      of natural disturbance (inundation frequency) on community structure, food web 
      complexity and resource use of soil mesofauna using stable isotope analysis (15N, 
      13C) in three salt marsh zones. In this intertidal habitat, the pioneer zone is 
      exposed to inundations twice a day, but lower and upper salt marshes are less 
      frequently inundated based on shore height. The mesofauna comprised 86 species / 
      taxa dominated by Collembola, Oribatida and Mesostigmata. Shifts in environmental 
      disturbances influenced the structure of food webs, diversity and density 
      declined strongly from the land to the sea pointing to the importance of 
      increasing levels of inundation frequency. Accordingly, the reduced diversity and 
      density was associated by a simplification of the food web in the pioneer zone as 
      compared to the less inundated lower and upper salt marsh with a higher number of 
      trophic levels. Strong variations in δ15N signatures demonstrated that mesofauna 
      species are feeding at multiple trophic levels. Primary decomposers were low and 
      most mesofauna species functioned as secondary decomposers or predators including 
      second order predators or scavengers. The results document that major decomposer 
      taxa, such as Collembola and Oribatida, are more diverse than previously assumed 
      and predominantly dwell on autochthonous resources of the respective salt marsh 
      zone. The results further suggest that Mesostigmata mostly adopt an intraguild 
      predation lifestyle. The high trophic position of a large number of predators 
      suggests that intraguild predation is of significant importance in salt marsh 
      food webs. Presumably, intraguild predation contributes to stabilizing the salt 
      marsh food web against disturbances.

AB  - As top-predators in marine ecosystems, seabirds are regarded as appropriate 
      bioindicator species for a variety of contaminants. Mercury (Hg) is a global 
      pollutant, which can biomagnify along marine and freshwater food webs. Therefore, 
      mercury body burden in seabirds, such as gulls, will integrate information about 
      pollution in the environment. In the Ebro Delta (NE Spain), legacy mercury 
      pollution from a chlor-alkali industry located ca. 100 km upstream of the Ebro 
      river mouth has been affecting the delta environment. We have analyzed a 15-year 
      temporal series (2004-2019) of Hg in birds from a breeding colony of Audouin's 
      gull (Ichthyaetus audouinii) in the Ebro Delta to understand how fluctuations in 
      Hg levels are coupled to human activities in the industrial area in the upstream 
      region of the river. Stable isotopic signatures of C and N (δ(13)C(bulk) and 
      δ(15)N(bulk)) are determined to characterize the trophic ecology of the species. 
      Since only δ(13)C(bulk) but not δ(15)N(bulk) was associated with THg levels, we 
      used compound-specific stable nitrogen isotope analysis of amino acids (AA-CSIA) 
      to evaluate the causes of variation in δ(15)N(bulk) to further investigate the 
      idea of a decoupling of δ(15)N(bulk) and THg over time. We found Audouin's gull 
      to be sensitive to Hg variations in the environment due to anthropogenic changes 
      and to be a good indicator species for this contaminant in the Ebro Delta.

PG  - 91-114
AB  - Top predators in the marine environment integrate chemical signals acquired from 
      their prey that reflect both the species consumed and the regions from which the 
      prey were taken. These chemical tracers-stable isotope ratios of carbon and 
      nitrogen; persistent organic pollutant (POP) concentrations, patterns and ratios; 
      and fatty acid profiles-were measured in blubber biopsy samples from North 
      Pacific killer whales (Orcinus orca) (n=84) and were used to provide further 
      insight into their diet, particularly for the offshore group, about which little 
      dietary information is available. The offshore killer whales were shown to 
      consume prey species that were distinctly different from those of sympatric 
      resident and transient killer whales. In addition, it was confirmed that the 
      offshores forage as far south as California. Thus, these results provide evidence 
      that the offshores belong to a third killer whale ecotype. Resident killer whale 
      populations showed a gradient in stable isotope profiles from west (central 
      Aleutians) to east (Gulf of Alaska) that, in part, can be attributed to a shift 
      from off-shelf to continental shelf-based prey. Finally, stable isotope ratio 
      results, supported by field observations, showed that the diet in spring and 
      summer of eastern Aleutian Island transient killer whales is apparently not 
      composed exclusively of Steller sea lions.

TI  - Estimation of the major source and sink of methylmercury in the Florida 
      Everglades.
PG  - 5885-93
LID - 10.1021/es204410x [doi]
AB  - Mercury methylation and/or demethylation have been observed in several 
      compartments [soil (saturated soils covered by standing water), floc, periphyton, 
      and water] of the Everglades, a wetland with mercury as one of the major water 
      quality concerns. However, it is still unclear which compartment is the major 
      source or sink due to the lack of estimation and comparison of the net 
      methylmercury (MeHg) production or degradation in these compartments. The lack of 
      this information has limited our understanding of Hg cycling in this ecosystem. 
      This study adopted a double stable isotope ((199)Hg(2+) and Me(201)Hg) addition 
      technique to determine the methylation/demethylation rate constants and the net 
      MeHg production rates in each compartment. This study improved the previous 
      models for estimating these parameters by (1) taking into account the difference 
      between newly input and ambient mercury in methylation/demethylation efficiency 
      and (2) correcting the contribution of photodemethylation to Me(199)Hg 
      concentration when calculating methylation rates in water. The net MeHg 
      production rate in each compartment was then estimated to identify the major 
      sources and sinks of MeHg. The results indicate that these improvements in 
      modeling are necessary, as a significant error would occur otherwise. Soil was 
      identified to be the largest source of MeHg in the Everglades, while the floc and 
      water column were identified as the major sinks. The role of periphyton varies, 
      appearing to be a source in the northern Everglades and a sink in the southern 
      Everglades. Soil could be the largest source for MeHg in the water column, while 
      methylation in periphyton could also contribute significantly in the northern 
      Everglades.

TI  - Isotopic evidence for axial tree stem methane oxidation within subtropical 
      lowland forests.
PG  - 2200-2212
LID - 10.1111/nph.17343 [doi]
AB  - Knowledge regarding mechanisms moderating methane (CH(4) ) sink/source behaviour 
      along the soil-tree stem-atmosphere continuum remains incomplete. Here, we 
      applied stable isotope analysis (δ(13) C-CH(4) ) to gain insights into axial 
      CH(4) transport and oxidation in two globally distributed subtropical lowland 
      species (Melaleuca quinquenervia and Casuarina glauca). We found consistent 
      trends in CH(4) flux (decreasing with height) and δ(13) C-CH(4) enrichment 
      (increasing with height) in relation to stem height from ground. The average 
      lower tree stem δ(13) C-CH(4) (0-40 cm) of Melaleuca and Casuarina (-53.96‰ and 
      -65.89‰) were similar to adjacent flooded soil CH(4) ebullition (-52.87‰ and 
      -62.98‰), suggesting that stem CH(4) is derived mainly by soil sources. Upper 
      stems (81-200 cm) displayed distinct δ(13) C-CH(4) enrichment (Melaleuca -44.6‰ 
      and Casuarina -46.5‰, respectively). Coupled 3D-photogrammetry with novel 3D-stem 
      measurements revealed distinct hotspots of CH(4) flux and isotopic fractionation 
      on Melaleuca, which were likely due to bark anomalies in which preferential 
      pathways of gas efflux were enhanced. Diel experiments revealed greater δ(13) 
      C-CH(4) enrichment and higher oxidation rates in the afternoon, compared with the 
      morning. Overall, we estimated that c. 33% of the methane was oxidised between 
      lower and upper stems during axial transport, therefore potentially representing 
      a globally significant, yet previously unaccounted for, methane sink.

AB  - Temporal changes in benthic food web structure were analyzed in an artificial 
      tidal flat in inner Tokyo Bay, Japan, using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope 
      ratios (δ(13)C and δ(15)N). Microphytobenthos were the most important food 
      sources of macrozoobenthos, due to high microphytobenthic biomass on the tidal 
      flat, while phytoplankton in canal water (canal POMPP), terrestrial materials 
      from urban surface runoff (canal POMTM), and marsh plants were less important. 
      Dietary contribution of microphytobenthos was highest in April to June, while 
      decreased towards December owing to the supply of canal POMPP and canal POMTM 
      following red tides and heavy rainfall events in summer to fall. Temporal changes 
      in δ(15)N (Δδ(15)N) of consumer corresponded well to the (15)N-enrichment in 
      canal POMPP in summer. A meta-analysis showed that the consumer-Δδ(15)N was 
      considerably larger in inner Tokyo Bay than those in other estuaries, which may 
      be a specific characteristic of benthic food web in highly urbanized estuaries.

TI  - Hurricane disturbance drives trophic changes in neotropical mountain stream food 
      webs.
PG  - e4202
LID - 10.1002/ecy.4202 [doi]
AB  - Food webs are complex ecological networks that reveal species interactions and 
      energy flow in ecosystems. Prevailing ecological knowledge on forested streams 
      suggests that their food webs are based on allochthonous carbon, driven by a 
      constant supply of organic matter from adjacent vegetation and limited primary 
      production due to low light conditions. Extreme climatic disturbances can disrupt 
      these natural ecosystem dynamics by altering resource availability, which leads 
      to changes in food web structure and functioning. Here, we quantify the response 
      of stream food webs to two major hurricanes (Irma and María, Category 5 and 4, 
      respectively) that struck Puerto Rico in September 2017. Within two tropical 
      forested streams (first and second order), we collected ecosystem and food web 
      data 6 months prior to the hurricanes and 2, 9, and 18 months afterward. We 
      assessed the structural (e.g., canopy) and hydrological (e.g., discharge) 
      characteristics of the ecosystem and monitored changes in basal resources (i.e., 
      algae, biofilm, and leaf litter), consumers (e.g., aquatic invertebrates, 
      riparian consumers), and applied Layman's community-wide metrics using the 
      isotopic composition of (13) C and (15) N. Continuous stream discharge 
      measurements indicated that the hurricanes did not cause an extreme hydrological 
      event. However, the sixfold increase in canopy openness and associated changes in 
      litter input appeared to trigger an increase in primary production. These food 
      webs were primarily based on terrestrially derived carbon before the hurricanes, 
      but most taxa (including Atya and Xiphocaris shrimp, the consumers with highest 
      biomass) shifted their food source to autochthonous carbon within 2 months of the 
      hurricanes. We also found evidence that the hurricanes dramatically altered the 
      structure of the food web, resulting in shorter (i.e., smaller food-chain 
      length), narrower (i.e., lower diversity of carbon sources) food webs, as well as 
      increased trophic species packing. This study demonstrates how hurricane 
      disturbance can alter stream food webs, changing the trophic base from 
      allochthonous to autochthonous resources via changes in the physical environment 
      (i.e., canopy defoliation). As hurricanes become more frequent and severe due to 
      climate change, our findings greatly contribute to our understanding of the 
      mechanisms that maintain forested stream trophic interactions amidst global 
      change.

AB  - Developing a lifelong marking method for Lycorma delicatula (White, 1845) is 
      crucial to investigate ecological processes. Here we validate a marking method 
      using stable isotope enrichment (15N) of host plants to track spotted lanternfly 
      (SLF), an invasive species causing economic damage on grapes, hardwood forest and 
      landscape tree species. To validate this method, we first determined the isotope 
      dosage to be sprayed on the host plants and subsequently detected in SLF. Second, 
      we examined whether 15N mark remains detectable from the nymphal to adult stage. 
      We demonstrated that two stable isotope dosages applied to the host plants were 
      assimilated by the insect and equally detectable in the exoskeleton, wings, and 
      mature eggs ready to be oviposited. This safe and reliable method can be used to 
      examine fundamental processes of the biology and ecology of SLF that range from 
      dietary resources and resource allocation to food-web structure and dispersal 
      patterns.

TI  - Increased reliance of stream macroinvertebrates on terrestrial food sources 
      linked to forest management intensity.
PG  - e01889
LID - 10.1002/eap.1889 [doi]
AB  - Our understanding of how forest management practices affect the relative 
      importance of autochthonous vs. allochthonous resource use by headwater stream 
      food webs is relatively poor. To address this, we used stable isotope (C, N, and 
      H) analyses of food sources and macroinvertebrates from 15 streams in New 
      Brunswick (Canada) and assessed how different catchment conditions arising from 
      the gradient in forest management intensity affect the contribution of 
      autochthonous resources to these food webs. Aquatic primary production 
      contributed substantially to the biomass of invertebrates in these headwater 
      streams, especially for scrapers and collector-gatherers (25-75%). However, the 
      contribution of algae to food webs decreased as forest management intensity (road 
      density and associated sediments, water cations/carbon, and dissolved organic 
      matter humification) increased, and as canopy openness decreased. This trend was 
      probably due to an increase in the delivery of organic and inorganic terrestrial 
      materials (dissolved and in suspension) in areas of greater harvesting intensity 
      and road density, which resulted in more heterotrophic biofilms. Overall, results 
      suggest that, despite the presence of riparian buffers, forest management can 
      affect stream food web structure via changes in energy flows, and that increased 
      protection should be directed at minimizing ground disturbance in areas with 
      direct hydrological connection to streams and at reducing dissolved and 
      particulate matter inputs from roads and stream crossings in catchments with high 
      degrees of management activity.

AB  - Descriptors of trophic niche and of food web structure and function have been 
      suggested as integrative and sensitive endpoints of toxicant effects. In the 
      present study, carbon and nitrogen stable isotope signatures were used to assess 
      the effects of the dithiocarbamate fungicide thiram (35 and 170μg/L nominal 
      concentrations) and of a petroleum distillate (0.01, 0.4, 2 and 20mg/L nominal 
      loadings as Hydrocarbon Emulsion or Hydrocarbon Water Accommodated Fraction) on 
      the trophic niche of two freshwater gastropods in artificial streams (Radix 
      peregra) and ponds (Lymnaea stagnalis). Results were analyzed using classical 
      univariate statistical methods and recently proposed uni- and multivariate 
      metrics of the realized trophic niche of species. The trophic niche metrics were 
      highly sensitive to both types of chemicals, but exposure resulted in different 
      response patterns according to the nature of the tested compound. Thiram clearly 
      affected gastropod trophic niche leading to a change in the food resources used 
      and resulting in trophic niche expansion (i.e., increase of diversity of used 
      resources, especially dead animals) or trophic niche contraction (i.e., decrease 
      of diversity of used resources) across time. Both gastropod taxa exposed to 
      hydrocarbons showed a clear trophic niche expansion. Trophic niche metrics 
      therefore provide a promising way of investigating non-lethal effects of exposure 
      to organic chemicals on aquatic invertebrates, and subsequent disturbances in 
      food webs.

PG  - 54-9
AB  - In this study, the value of carbon (delta13C) and nitrogen (delta15N) stable 
      isotope ratios were determined in nymphs of a top-predator, the common 
      backswimmer (Notonecta glauca L.), collected in 18 m3 outdoor freshwater 
      mesocosms used to assess the fate and ecotoxicological effects of a diphenyl 
      ether herbicide, fomesafen, applied alone or in combination with Agral 90 
      (mixture of polyethoxylated derivatives of nonylphenol). Both treatments had a 
      negative effect on delta13C values which may reflect changes in carbon fluxes 
      across food webs in the treated ponds associated with a shift in phytoplankton 
      structure. A decrease in delta15N values was observed in the nymphs collected in 
      mixture-treated ponds, which was presumably due to an increase in the abundance 
      of rotifers and Chironominae larvae in these ponds. These preliminary results 
      indicate that stable isotope ratios may be used as shortcuts to detect 
      qualitative or quantitative shifts in the structure of aquatic food webs caused 
      by pollutants.

AB  - Tunas are highly specialized predators that have evolved numerous adaptations for 
      a lifestyle that requires large amounts of energy consumption. Here we review our 
      understanding of the bioenergetics and feeding dynamics of tunas on a global 
      scale, with an emphasis on yellowfin, bigeye, skipjack, albacore, and Atlantic 
      bluefin tunas. Food consumption balances bioenergetics expenditures for 
      respiration, growth (including gonad production), specific dynamic action, 
      egestion, and excretion. Tunas feed across the micronekton and some large 
      zooplankton. Some tunas appear to time their life history to take advantage of 
      ephemeral aggregations of crustacean, fish, and molluscan prey. Ontogenetic and 
      spatial diet differences are substantial, and significant interdecadal changes in 
      prey composition have been observed. Diet shifts from larger to smaller prey taxa 
      highlight ecosystem-wide changes in prey availability and diversity and provide 
      implications for changing bioenergetics requirements into the future. Where tunas 
      overlap, we show evidence of niche separation between them; resources are divided 
      largely by differences in diet percentages and size ranges of prey taxa. The lack 
      of long-term data limits the ability to predict impacts of climate change on tuna 
      feeding behaviour. We note the need for systematic collection of feeding data as 
      part of routine monitoring of these species, and we highlight the advantages of 
      using biochemical techniques for broad-scale analyses of trophic relations. We 
      support the continued development of ecosystem models, which all too often lack 
      the regional-specific trophic data needed to adequately investigate climate and 
      fishing impacts.

AB  - Here, we analyse changes throughout time in the isotopic niche of the Franciscana 
      dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei), the South American fur seal (Arctocephalus 
      australis) and the South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens) from the Río de la 
      Plata estuary and adjacent Atlantic Ocean to test the hypothesis that fishing may 
      modify the diet of small-gape predators by reducing the average size of prey. The 
      overall evidence, from stable isotope and stomach contents analyses, reveals 
      major changes in resource partitioning between the three predators considered, 
      mainly because of an increased access of Franciscana dolphins to juvenile 
      demersal fishes. These results are consistent with the changes in the length 
      distribution of demersal fish species resulting from fishing and suggest that 
      Franciscana dolphin has been the most benefited species of the three marine 
      mammal species considered because of its intermediate mouth gape. In conclusion, 
      the impact of fishing on marine mammals goes beyond the simple reduction in prey 
      biomass and is highly dependent on the mouth gape of the species involved.

AB  - Microbe-mediated anaerobic degradation is a practical method for remediation of 
      the hazardous monoaromatic hydrocarbons (BTEX, including benzene, toluene, 
      ethylbenzene and xylenes) under electron-deficient contaminated sites. However, 
      how do the anaerobic functional microbes adapt to oxygen exposure and flexibly 
      catabolize BTEX remain poorly understood. We investigated the switches of 
      substrate spectrum and bacterial community upon oxygen perturbation in a 
      nitrate-amended anaerobic toluene-degrading microbiota which was dominated by 
      Aromatoleum species. DNA-stable isotope probing demonstrated that Aromatoleum 
      species was involved in anaerobic mineralization of toluene. Metagenome-assembled 
      genome of Aromatoleum species harbored both the nirBD-type genes for nitrate 
      reduction to ammonium coupled with toluene oxidation and the additional 
      meta-cleavage pathway for aerobic benzene catabolism. Once the anaerobic 
      microbiota was fully exposed to oxygen and benzene, 1.05 ± 0.06% of 
      Diaphorobacter species rapidly replaced Aromatoleum species and flourished to 
      96.72 ± 0.01%. Diaphorobacter sp. ZM was isolated, which was not only able to 
      utilize benzene as the sole carbon source for aerobic growth and but also 
      innovatively reduce nitrate to ammonium with citrate/lactate/glucose as the 
      carbon source under anaerobic conditions. This study expands our understanding of 
      the adaptive mechanism of microbiota for environmental redox disturbance and 
      provides theoretical guidance for the bioremediation of BTEX-contaminated sites.

AB  - We examined mercury concentrations in three fish assemblages to estimate 
      biomagnification rates in the Iténez main river, affected by anthropogenic 
      activities, and two unperturbed rivers from the Iténez basin, Bolivian Amazon. 
      Rivers presented low to moderate water mercury concentrations (from 1.25 ng L(-1) 
      to 2.96 ng L(-1)) and natural differences in terms of sediment load. Mercury 
      biomagnification rates were confronted to trophic structure depicted by carbon 
      and nitrogen stable isotopes composition (δ(15)N; δ(13)C) of primary trophic 
      sources, invertebrates and fishes. Results showed a slight fish contamination in 
      the Iténez River compared to the unperturbed rivers, with higher mercury 
      concentrations in piscivore species (0.15 µg g(-1) vs. 0.11 µg g(-1) in the 
      unperturbed rivers) and a higher biomagnification rate. Trophic structure 
      analysis showed that the higher biomagnification rate in the Iténez River could 
      not be attributed to a longer food chain. Nevertheless, it revealed for the 
      Iténez River a higher contribution of periphyton to the diet of the primary 
      consumers fish species; and more negative δ(13)C values for primary trophic 
      sources, invertebrates and fishes that could indicate a higher contribution of 
      methanotrophic bacteria. These two factors may enhance methylation and methyl 
      mercury transfer in the food web and thus, alternatively or complementarily to 
      the impact of the anthropogenic activities, may explain mercury differences 
      observed in fishes from the Iténez River in comparison to the two other rivers.

AB  - Development in foraging behaviour and dietary intake of many vertebrates are 
      age-structured. Differences in feeding ecology may correlate with ontogenetic 
      shifts in dispersal patterns, and therefore affect foraging habitat and resource 
      utilization. Such life-history traits have important implications in interpreting 
      tropho-dynamic linkages. Stable isotope ratios in the whiskers of sub-yearling 
      southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina; n = 12) were used, in conjunction with 
      satellite telemetry and environmental data, to examine their foraging habitat and 
      diet during their first foraging migration. The trophic position of seals from 
      Macquarie Island (54°30'S, 158°57'E) was estimated using stable carbon (δ(1) 
      (3)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) ratios along the length of the whisker, which 
      provided a temporal record of prey intake. Satellite-relayed data loggers 
      provided details on seal movement patterns, which were related to isotopic 
      concentrations along the whisker. Animals fed in waters south of the Polar Front 
      (>60°S) or within Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living 
      Resources (CCAMLR) Statistical Subareas 88.1 and 88.2, as indicated by both their 
      depleted δ(1) (3)C (<-20‰) values, and tracking data. They predominantly 
      exploited varying proportions of mesopelagic fish and squid, and crustaceans, 
      such as euphausiids, which have not been reported as a prey item for this 
      species. Comparison of isotopic data between sub-yearlings, and 1, 2 and 3 yr 
      olds indicated that sub-yearlings, limited by their size, dive capabilities and 
      prey capture skills to feeding higher in the water column, fed at a lower trophic 
      level than older seals. This is consistent with the consumption of euphausiids 
      and most probably, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), which constitute an 
      abundant, easily accessible source of prey in water masses used by this age class 
      of seals. Isotopic assessment and concurrent tracking of seals are successfully 
      used here to identify ontogenetic shifts in broad-scale foraging habitat use and 
      diet preferences in a highly migratory predator.

AB  - We investigated how establishment of invasive dreissenid mussels impacted the 
      structure and energy sources of the littoral benthic food web of a large 
      temperate lake. We combined information about pre- and postdreissenid abundance, 
      biomass, and secondary production of the littoral benthos with results of carbon 
      and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of archival (predreissenid) and recent 
      (postdreissenid) samples of all common benthic taxa. This approach enabled us to 
      determine the importance of benthic and sestonic carbon to the littoral food web 
      before, and more than a decade after dreissenid establishment. Long term 
      dreissenid presence was associated with a 32-fold increase in abundance, 6-fold 
      increase in biomass, and 14-fold increase in secondary production of the littoral 
      benthos. Dreissenids comprised a large portion of the post-invasion benthos, 
      making up 13, 38, and 56% of total abundance, biomass, and secondary production, 
      respectively. The predreissenid food web was supported primarily by benthic 
      primary production, while sestonic material was relatively more important to the 
      postdreissenid food web. The absolute importance of both sestonic material and 
      benthic primary production to the littoral benthos increased considerably 
      following dreissenid establishment. Our results show drastic alterations to food 
      web structure and suggest that dreissenid mussels redirect energy and material 
      from the water column to the littoral benthos both through biodeposition of 
      sestonic material as well as stimulation of benthic primary production.

TI  - Reconstructing temporal variation in great ape and other primate diets: A 
      methodological framework for isotope analyses in hair.
PG  - 1004-16
LID - 10.1002/ajp.22497 [doi]
AB  - Stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen in hair provides a versatile tool 
      for reconstructing feeding behavior in elusive primate species. Particularly in 
      great apes, researchers can sample long hair completely non-invasively from 
      nests, allowing the investigation of inter- and intra-individual dietary 
      variation. Given its incremental growth pattern, hair records temporal shifts in 
      diet over long periods and allows one to reconstruct seasonal dietary patterns in 
      species that cannot be directly observed. However, as for other sample materials, 
      there are potential drawbacks related to the properties of hair keratin. Here I 
      review some important facts on the nature of primate hair and also introduce new 
      isotopic data from infant bonobo hair to provide methodological recommendations 
      for future sample collection in the field and sample preparation in the 
      laboratory. While these methodological guidelines focus on great apes which can 
      be sampled strictly non-invasively, I also consider applications to other 
      free-ranging primates. The biochemical composition, growth cycle, isotope 
      turnover rate and isotopic fractionation in hair keratin are particularly 
      relevant for data analysis and interpretation. Also, one can microscopically 
      identify infant hairs and analyze them separately to study nursing and weaning 
      behavior in primates. The goal of this article is to encourage primatologists to 
      analyze the stable isotope ratios of hair to assess primate feeding ecology. Am.

TI  - Isotopic niche alteration of a predator fish in a dammed Amazonian black water 
      river.
PG  - 1530-1539
LID - 10.1111/jfb.15230 [doi]
AB  - Although many upstream effects of a dam on the trophic ecology of fish have been 
      reported, little is known about their downstream effects on the isotopic niche of 
      Amazonian predator fish. The authors used stable isotope analysis of δ(13) C and 
      δ(15) N to determine the downstream effects of damming of the Uatumã River on the 
      niche width, carbon energy sources and trophic position of peacock bass Cichla 
      temensis comparing with a free-flowing river in the Amazon basin, Brazil, during 
      the peak flood and early falling water period of 2020. They found that the C. 
      temensis population of the undammed river had a smaller niche width than the C. 
      temensis population of the dammed river, despite the greater number of prey 
      trophic levels utilized and the higher trophic position of C. temensis 
      individuals. The results demonstrate that in both rivers there is a gradual shift 
      in the contribution of prey fish sources to the diet of C. temensis throughout 
      its growth, even among adult individuals. They conclude that the isotopic niche 
      of C. temensis was altered by damming during the period of late high water to 
      early low water in the Uatumã River.

TI  - Biodilution of heavy metals in a stream macroinvertebrate food web: evidence from 
      stable isotope analysis.
PG  - 57-67
LID - 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.01.006 [doi]
AB  - Analysis of carbon (delta13C) and nitrogen (delta15N) stable isotopes provides an 
      increasingly important means of understanding the complex trophic structure of 
      macroinvertebrate communities in streams. We coupled a stable isotope approach 
      with a contaminant analysis of six metals (Pb, Ag, Zn, Hg, Cu, As) to trace the 
      accumulation and dilution of metals from an abandoned mine across trophic levels 
      of the benthic community in Ginzan Creek, Japan. The delta15N signature increased 
      with trophic level, with mean increases of 4.70 per thousand from producers to 
      primary consumers and 3.06 per thousand from primary to secondary consumers. 
      Tissue Pb and Ag concentrations were negatively correlated with delta15N, 
      indicating biodilution of both metals through the food web. Although 
      macroinvertebrate taxon body mass was negatively correlated with tissue metal 
      concentration at several sites, it did not increase with trophic level (as 
      delta15N) in any of the sites, suggesting that changes in body mass were not the 
      cause of biodilution. Our findings suggest invertebrates at higher trophic levels 
      may exhibit increasingly efficient excretion of metals. Autotrophic epilithon 
      (mean delta13C= -21.3 per thousand) had a much higher concentration of mined 
      metals than did riparian vegetation (mean delta13C= -29.3 per thousand); 
      nonetheless, a carbon-mixing model indicated that taxa feeding on autochthonous 
      carbon sources did not accumulate more metal than allochthonous feeders. It is 
      likely that the notably high metal concentration of allochthonous FPOM plays an 
      important role in the trophic transfer of metals. Our data suggest the strong 
      potential for stable isotope analysis to enhance our understanding of metal 
      transfer through stream macroinvertebrate food webs.

AB  - Pesticides are a class of xenobiotics intentionally released into the 
      environment. Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) was used as a fungicide from 1945, leaving 
      behind many contaminated sites. Very few studies have examined the biodegradation 
      of HCB or the fate of HCB-derived carbon. Here we report that certain bacterial 
      populations are capable of deriving carbon from HCB in contaminated soil under 
      aerobic conditions. These populations are primarily Proteobacteria, including 
      Methylobacterium and Pseudomonas, which predominated as detected by stable 
      isotope probing (SIP) and 16S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing. Due to the 
      nature of SIP, which can be used as a functional method solely for assimilatory 
      processes, it is not possible to elucidate whether these populations metabolized 
      directly HCB or intermediates of its metabolism produced by different 
      populations. The possibility exists that HCB is degraded via the formation of 
      pentachlorophenol (PCP), which is further mineralized. With this in mind, we 
      designed primers to amplify PCP 4-monooxygenase-coding sequences based on the 
      available pcpB gene sequence from Methylobacterium radiotolerans JCM 2831. Based 
      on 16S rRNA gene analysis, organisms closely related to this strain were detected 
      in (13)C-labeled DNA. Using the designed primers, we were able to amplify pcpB 
      genes in both total community DNA and (13)C-DNA. This indicates that HCB might be 
      transformed into PCP before it gets assimilated. In summary, this study is the 
      first report on which bacterial populations benefit from carbon originating in 
      the pesticide HCB in a contaminated soil.

AB  - Tuna and billfish are large pelagic fish of ecological importance in open oceans. 
      As top predators with a long lifespan, they are prone to exposure to various 
      contaminants such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and contaminants of 
      emerging concern. In this study, three pollutant families were investigated, 
      including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs) 
      and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), including perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) 
      and perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). Contamination was investigated in 
      individuals from three tropical tuna species, namely bigeye (Thunnus obesus), 
      skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) and yellowfin (Thunnusalbacares) tunas and the 
      billfish swordfish (Xiphias gladius), collected from various areas of the western 
      Indian Ocean (WIO) in 2013-2014. Contamination levels and profiles were examined 
      in fish muscle, together with biological parameters (fish length / age, sex, 
      lipid content) and ecological tracers (carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes). POP 
      levels were low in all species in comparison to other locations worldwide, 
      revealing a low impact of anthropogenic organic contaminants in the WIO. A 
      predominance of OCPs (especially DDTs) versus PCBs was highlighted in all 
      species; PFASs were predominant over chlorinated POPs in tunas. Among the studied 
      PFASs, long-chain PFCAs were found to prevail over PFOS in all species. Organic 
      contaminant profiles differed across species according to their foraging habitat; 
      swordfish and bigeye tuna, which both feed in deep oceanic layers, showed 
      similarities in their contaminant profiles. Geographically, the distinct DDT 
      profiles of fish from the Mozambique Channel suggested an exposure to different 
      DDT sources, in line with regional use of this insecticide and coupled with an 
      extended residence time of fish in the Channel. To our knowledge, the data 
      presented here are among the first obtained for legacy and emerging organic 
      contaminants in various species of large pelagic predators from the WIO.

AB  - Chlorinated flame retardants, particularly dechlorane plus (DP), were widely used 
      in commercial applications and are ubiquitous in the environment. A total of 
      seven species of aquatic organisms were collected concurrently from the region of 
      a chemical production facility in Huai’an, China. DP and structurally related 
      compounds including mirex, dechloranes 602, 603, 604, chlordene plus (CP), DP 
      monoadduct (DPMA), and two dechlorinated breakdown products of DP, 
      decachloropentacyclooctadecadiene (anti-Cl(10)-DP) and 
      undecachloropentacyclooctadecadiene (anti-Cl(11)-DP), were detected in these 
      aquatic organisms. Nitrogen stable isotope ratios were also measured to determine 
      the trophic levels of the organisms. Trophic magnification factors (TMFs) for 
      these chemicals were calculated with values ranging from 1.0 to 3.1. TMFs for CP, 
      mirex, anti-DP, and ∑DP were statistically greater than 1, showing evidence of 
      biomagnification in the food web. Concentration ratios of anti-Cl(11)-DP to 
      anti-DP showed a significant relationship with trophic level, implying that 
      anti-Cl(11)-DP had a higher food-web magnification potential than its precursor. 
      The biota-sediment accumulation factors and TMFs for DP demonstrated 
      stereoselectivity, with syn-DP having a greater bioaccumulation potential than 
      anti-DP in the aquatic environment.

TI  - Short-term nitrogen dynamics are impacted by defoliation and drought in Fagus 
      sylvatica L. branches.
PG  - 792-804
LID - 10.1093/treephys/tpz002 [doi]
AB  - The predicted recurrence of adverse climatic events such as droughts, which 
      disrupt nutrient accessibility for trees, could jeopardize the nitrogen (N) 
      metabolism in forest trees. Internal tree N cycling capacities are crucial to 
      ensuring tree survival but how the N metabolism of forest trees responds to 
      intense, repeated environmental stress is not well known. For 2 years, we 
      submitted 9-year-old beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) trees to either a moderate or a 
      severe prolonged drought or a yearly removal of 75% of the foliage to induce 
      internal N cycling changes. During the second year of stress, in spring and 
      summer, we sprayed 15N-urea on the leaves (one branch per tree). Then, for 14 
      days, we traced the 15N dynamics through the leaves, into foliar proteins and 
      into the branch compartments (leaves and stems segments), as well as its 
      long-distance transfer from the labeled branches to the tree apical twigs. 
      Defoliation caused a short- and mid-term N increase in the leaves, which remained 
      the main sink for N. Whatever the treatment and the date, most of the leaf 15N 
      stayed in the leaves and was invested in soluble proteins (60-68% of total leaf 
      N). 15N stayed more in the proximal part of the branch in response to drought 
      compared with other treatments. The long-distance transport of N was maintained 
      even under harsh drought, highlighting efficient internal N recycling in beech 
      trees. Under extreme constraints creating an N and water imbalance, compensation 
      mechanisms operated at the branch level in beech trees and allowed them (i) to 
      maintain leaf N metabolism and protein synthesis and (ii) to ensure the seasonal 
      short- and long-distance transfer of recycled leaf N even under drastic water 
      shortage conditions.

TI  - [Impacts of Spartina alterniflora invasion on the benthic food web in the Yellow 
      River Delta during autumn].
PG  - 4499-4507
LID - 10.13287/j.1001-9332.202112.009 [doi]
AB  - Spartina alterniflora was introduced into the Yellow River Delta (YRD) in 1990 
      with the purpose of shore protection and siltation accretion. However, it spread 
      rapidly and became a severe threat to the local coastal wetland ecosystem. To 
      assess the impacts of S. alterniflora invasion on the benthic food web, we 
      sampled the potential food sources of macrobenthos in November 2020, analyzed the 
      trophic level and the benthic food web structure based on stable isotope 
      technique. Results showed that the average δ(13)C values of macrobenthic food 
      sources followed an order: sediment organic matter (SOM) > S. alterniflora > 
      benthic microalgae > particulate organic matter (POM) > Suaeda salsa. The average 
      δ(15)N values significantly differed among food sources, ranging from 1.24‰ to 
      9.03‰. The trophic levels of different macrobenthos ranged from 1.73 to 4.19, of 
      which the bivalve species was the lowest one. S. alterniflora and the decayed 
      debris were the most important food sources for macrobenthos, but without any 
      impact on the trophic level structure of macro-benthos. In conclusion, Spartina 
      alterniflora invasion distinctly changed the composition of food sources of 
      macrobenthos through a "bottom-up" effect, which would probably impact the local 
      food web structure in the YRD wetland.

TI  - Stable Mercury Trends Support a Long-Term Diet Shift Away from Marine Foraging in 
      Salish Sea Glaucous-Winged Gulls over the Last Century.
PG  - 12097-12105
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.1c03760 [doi]
AB  - Marine predators are monitored as indicators of pollution, but such trends can be 
      complicated by variation in diet. Glaucous-winged gulls (Larus glaucescens) have 
      experienced a dietary shift over the past century, from mainly marine to 
      including more terrestrial/freshwater inputs, with unknown impacts on mercury 
      (Hg) trends. We examined 109-year trends in total mercury (THg) and methylmercury 
      (MeHg) concentrations in glaucous-winged gull feathers (1887-1996) from the 
      Salish Sea. Adult flank feathers had higher MeHg concentrations than immature 
      feathers, and males head feathers had higher THg concentrations than females. 
      Overall, we found no evidence of a trend in feather MeHg or THg concentrations 
      over time from 1887 to 1996. In the same individuals, δ(15)N, δ(13)C, and δ(34)S 
      declined over time in gull feathers. In comparison, egg THg concentrations 
      declined from 1970 to 2019 in two species of cormorants, likely reflecting 
      decreases in local Hg sources. We conclude that diet shifts through time may have 
      countered increased Hg deposition from long-range transport in glaucous-winged 
      gulls. The lack of Hg trends over time in glaucous-winged gull feathers provides 
      additional support that these gulls have decreased the amount of marine forage 
      fish in their diet.

TI  - Mercury concentrations are low in commercial fish species of Lake Ziway, 
      Ethiopia, but stable isotope data indicated biomagnification.

AB  - Stable isotope ratios of nitrogen (δ(15)N) and carbon (δ(13)C), complemented by 
      stomach content data, were used to assess the food web structure and trophic 
      transfer of mercury (Hg) in four commercial fish species of Lake Ziway, Ethiopia: 
      Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), catfish (Clarias gariepinus), Tilapia 
      zillii, and golden carp (Carassius auratus). Total mercury (THg in mg kg(-1), ww) 
      concentrations were low, with mean values of 0.033, 0.034, 0.025, and 0.011, in 
      C. gariepinus, T. zillii, C. auratus, and O. niloticus, respectively. The 
      relationships between mercury concentrations against total length (TL) and total 
      weight (TW) were positive and significant in T. zillii, C. auratus, and C. 
      gariepinus (P<0.01), but not in O. niloticus, which even showed a decreasing 
      tendency with increase in TL and TW. Regression of log THg vs. δ(15)N among all 
      fish species showed a significant correlation, indicating that mercury is 
      biomagnifying along the food web of Lake Ziway. Isotope ratios indicated that C. 
      gariepinus occupied the highest trophic level of the food web of Lake Ziway; but 
      contained similar THg concentrations as T. zillii, which is located at a lower 
      trophic level, probably due to a faster growth rate of C. gariepinus, and thus an 
      example of biodilution.

TI  - Stable Isotopes Reveal Trophic Partitioning and Trophic Plasticity of a Larval 
      Amphibian Guild.

AB  - Temporary ponds are highly variable systems where resource availability and 
      community structure change extensively over time, and consequently the food web 
      is highly dynamic. Amphibians play a critical role both as consumers and prey in 
      aquatic communities and yet there is still little information on the trophic 
      status of most amphibians. More importantly, little is known about the extent to 
      which they can alter their trophic ecology in response to changing conditions. We 
      experimentally investigated the effects of increased amphibian density, presence 
      of intraguild competitors, and presence of native and invasive predators (either 
      free or caged) on the trophic status of a Mediterranean amphibian guild, using 
      stable isotopes. We observed variations in δ13C and δ15N isotopic values among 
      amphibian species and treatments and differences in their food sources. 
      Macrophytes were the most important food resource for spadefoot toad tadpoles 
      (Pelobates cultripes) and relatively important for all anurans within the guild. 
      High density and presence of P. cultripes tadpoles markedly reduced macrophyte 
      biomass, forcing tadpoles to increase their feeding on detritus, algae and 
      zooplankton, resulting in lower δ13C values. Native dytiscid predators only 
      changed the isotopic signature of newts whereas invasive red swamp crayfish had 
      an enormous impact on environmental conditions and greatly affected the isotopic 
      values of amphibians. Crayfish forced tadpoles to increase detritus ingestion or 
      other resources depleted in δ13C. We found that the opportunistic amphibian 
      feeding was greatly conditioned by intra- and interspecific competition whereas 
      non-consumptive predator effects were negligible. Determining the trophic 
      plasticity of amphibians can help us understand natural and anthropogenic changes 
      in aquatic ecosystems and assess amphibians' ability to adjust to different 
      environmental conditions.

AB  - Plants rely primarily on rainfall infiltrating their root zones - a supply that 
      is inherently variable, and fluctuations are predicted to increase on most of the 
      Earth's surface. Yet, interrelationships between water availability and plant use 
      on short timescales are difficult to quantify and remain poorly understood. To 
      overcome previous methodological limitations, we coupled high-resolution in situ 
      observations of stable isotopes in soil and transpiration water. We applied the 
      approach along with Bayesian mixing modeling to track the fate of (2) H-labeled 
      rain pulses following drought through soil and plants of deciduous tree 
      ecosystems. We resolve how rainwater infiltrates the root zones in a 
      nonequilibrium process and show that tree species differ in their ability to 
      quickly acquire the newly available source. Sessile oak (Quercus petraea) 
      adjusted root uptake to vertical water availability patterns under drought, but 
      readjustment toward the rewetted topsoil was delayed. By contrast, European beech 
      (Fagus sylvatica) readily utilized water from all soil depths independent of 
      water depletion, enabling faster uptake of rainwater. Our results demonstrate 
      that species-specific plasticity and responses to water supply fluctuations on 
      short timescales can now be identified and must be considered to predict 
      vegetation functional dynamics and water cycling under current and future 
      climatic conditions.

TI  - Unravelling the role of allochthonous aquatic resources to food web structure in 
      a tropical riparian forest.

AB  - The role of matter and energy flow across ecosystem boundaries for the subsidized 
      consumer populations is well known. However, little is known on the effects of 
      allochthonous subsidies on food web structure and trophic niche dimensions of 
      consumers in the tropics. We excluded allochthonous aquatic insects from tropical 
      streams using greenhouse-type exclosures to test the influence of aquatic 
      allochthonous subsidies on the trophic structure and niche dimensions of 
      terrestrial predators using stable isotope methods. In exclosure treatments, 
      abundance and biomass of terrestrial predators, and biomass of phytophages 
      decreased and increased, respectively. Vegetation-living predators were more 
      responsive to allochthonous inputs than those living on the ground. Overall, 
      lower availability of allochthonous inputs did not affect community-wide metrics 
      and niche width of predators. However, the niche width of some spider families 
      had very low overlap between treatments, and others had wider isotopic niches in 
      the control than in the exclusion treatment. Most of the C and N in predators 
      living in control stretches came from aquatic subsidies, and those predators 
      living in the exclusion treatments switched their diets to terrestrial sources, 
      showing a preference of predators for allochthonous subsidies. Our results 
      suggest that allochthonous subsidies are also relevant to tropical fauna living 
      upon vegetation. Moreover, allochthonous resources may amplify the niche 
      dimension of certain predators or considerably change the trophic niche of 
      others. Our study highlights the importance of including modern isotopic tools in 
      elucidating the role of allochthonous resources on the patterns of trophic 
      structure and niche dimensions of consumers from donor ecosystems.

AB  - Tissue samples from four ungulate species from the south Mackenzie Mountain 
      region of the Northwest Territories (NT), Canada, were analysed for stable and 
      radioactive elements and (15)N and (13)C stable isotopes. Elevated Cd 
      concentrations in moose (Alces americanus) kidney have been observed in the 
      region and are a health care concern for consumers of traditional foods. This 
      study examined the factors associated with, and potential renal effects from, the 
      accumulation of cadmium, and interactions with other elements in four sympatric 
      ungulate species. Mean renal Cd concentration was highest in moose (48.3mg/kg 
      ww), followed by mountain caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) (13.9mg/kg ww) and 
      mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) (5.78mg/kg ww). No local sources of Cd were 
      evident and the elevated levels in moose are considered to be natural in origin. 
      Conversely, total Hg concentration was significantly higher in mountain caribou 
      kidney (0.21mg/kg ww) than in moose (0.011mg/kg ww). (134)Cs (t½=2.1 y) in 
      mountain goat and Dall's sheep (Ovis dalli) muscle is evidence of deposition from 
      the Fukushima reactor accident in 2011. (137)Cs (t½=30.2 y) in all four ungulates 
      is primarily a remnant of the nuclear weapons tests of the 1960s. The levels of 
      both nuclides are low and the risk to the animals and people consuming them is 
      negligible. Stable isotope δ(15)N and δ(13)C signatures in muscle showed a 
      separation between the mountain caribou, with a lichen-dominated diet, and moose, 
      which browse shrubs and forbs. Isotope signatures for mountain goat and Dall's 
      sheep showed generalist feeding patterns. Differences in elemental and 
      radionuclide levels between species were attributed to relative levels of metal 
      accumulation in the different food items in the diets of the respective species. 
      Kidneys from each species showed minor histological changes in the proximal 
      tubule and glomerulus, although glomerular changes were rare and all changes were 
      rare in mountain goat kidney. Kidney function was not expected to be affected in 
      any species. Provisional Monthly Intake recommendations from the WHO indicate 
      that Cd in moose organs will continue to be a public health care concern. 
      However, traditional foods continue to be an important nutritional component of 
      northern diets, particularly in consideration of the shift towards store-bought 
      food.

AB  - Compared to the extensive research on aquatic ecosystems, very little is known 
      about the sources and trophic transfer of methylmercury (MeHg) in terrestrial 
      ecosystems. In this study, we examine energy flow and trophic structure using 
      stable carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) isotope ratios, respectively, and 
      MeHg levels in basal resources and terrestrial invertebrates from four temperate 
      forest ecosystems. We show that MeHg levels in biota increased significantly ( p 
      < 0.01) with δ(13)C and δ(15)N at all sites, implying the importance of both 
      microbially processed diets (with increased δ(13)C) and trophic level (with 
      increased δ(15)N) at which organisms feed, on MeHg levels in forest floor biota. 
      The trophic magnification slopes of MeHg (defined as the slope of log(10)MeHg vs 
      δ(15)N) for these forest floor food webs (0.20-0.28) were not significantly 
      different ( p > 0.05) from those observed for diverse temperate freshwater 
      systems (0.24 ± 0.07; n = 78), demonstrating for the first time the nearly 
      equivalent efficiencies with which MeHg moves up the food chain in these 
      contrasting ecosystem types. Our results suggest that in situ production of MeHg 
      within the forest floor and efficient biomagnification both elevate MeHg levels 
      in carnivorous invertebrates in temperate forests, which can contribute to 
      significant bioaccumulation of this neurotoxin in terrestrial apex predators.

TI  - Can we use stable isotopes for ecotoxicological studies? Effect of DDT on 
      isotopic fractionation in Perca fluviatilis.
PG  - 734-9
LID - 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2009.05.033 [doi]
AB  - Nitrogen and carbon stable isotope analyses are frequently used to assess 
      contaminant biomagnification in animals in the wild. Previous studies, mainly on 
      plant but also on animal tissues, have shown that chemical stress can lead to 
      shifts in delta(15)N. In order to assess if an exposure to DDT at realistic 
      concentration disrupted stable isotope signature in animals, delta(15)N and 
      delta(13)C were studied in several tissues (liver, muscle, gill) of Perca 
      fluviatilis fed with the same commercial diet uncontaminated or contaminated with 
      DDT. We observed no DDT effect on the delta(15)N and delta(13)C of fish tissues. 
      Our results show that stable isotopes can remain useful for field 
      ecotoxicological studies despite food-chain contamination. However, correlations 
      between the delta(13)C or delta(15)N values measured in the different organs were 
      only found in DDT treated fish, suggesting some disruption of major biochemical 
      compound metabolism in tissues.

      catfish Clarias gariepinus (Burchell).
PG  - 134-42
AB  - The concentrations of total mercury (THg), stable isotopes of nitrogen 
      (delta(15)N) and carbon (delta(13)C), and the diet of the African sharptooth 
      catfish Clarias gariepinus in Lake Awassa, Ethiopia, were studied from January 
      2003 to February 2004. Values of the delta(15)N were used as an index of trophic 
      position in four length groups and compared to actual stomach contents. The diet 
      of C. gariepinus within the length range of 201-600 mm L(T) mainly consisted of 
      the small barb Barbus paludinosus, aquatic insects, and mollusks. The proportion 
      of fish prey in the diet was 60% by volume, irrespective of fish size. The 
      differences in delta(15)N values of individuals within and between length classes 
      were less than 3 per thousand, and were not significantly related to total 
      length, showing the similarity in trophic niche of the different sizes, which 
      corresponded to recorded stomach contents. Mercury concentrations were in the 
      range of 0.002-0.154 mg kg(-1) ww, and had no significant relationship to total 
      length. Hence, even large specimens of C. gariepinus have Hg values below the WHO 
      threshold of 0.2 mg kg(-1) ww. The slope of the regression line between log [Hg] 
      and delta(15)N was small, 0.06, indicating the absence of trophic shifts and 
      biomagnification of Hg in larger specimens in our samples. The low Hg 
      concentrations in C. gariepinus compared to the Hg concentrations in other 
      piscivorous fish species in Lake Awassa, such as Barbus intermedius and B. 
      paludinosus, may be due to its dependence on invertebrate preys at small size, 
      diet switching towards low Hg prey fish at larger size, and growth biodilution 
      owing to higher growth rate.

TI  - Ontogenetic dependence of Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) isotope 
      diet-to-tissue discrimination factors.
PG  - e9159
LID - 10.1002/rcm.9159 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: The diet of wild Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) is difficult 
      to assess because they are cryptic and nocturnal predators that are extremely 
      sensitive to disturbance by observers, and stomach content analysis is 
      challenging, especially in large specimens. Stable light isotope analysis 
      provides a means of assessing their diet, but diet-to-tissue discrimination 
      factors have yet to be established for the species. METHODS: Isotope ratio ((15) 
      N/(14) N and (13) C/(12) C expressed as δ(15) N and δ(13) C) analyses of scutes, 
      claws, and blood of farmed crocodiles of different sizes were compared with the 
      isotope values of their lifelong diet, which comprises chickens from a single 
      supplier. RESULTS: Systematic size dependence in the diet-to-tissue 
      discrimination factors for scute collagen, scute keratin, and claw keratin is 
      described in regression relationships against the snout to vent length. Fixed 
      values are presented for erythrocytes and blood plasma because blood was not 
      sampled from juveniles. CONCLUSIONS: The diet-to-tissue discrimination factors 
      help assess the diet of wild crocodiles. The diet of crocodiles from Lake Flag 
      Boshielo shows a clear ontogenic shift, as has been seen in other studies, and 
      the results strongly indicate a dependence on the terrestrial food web rather 
      than a fish diet. That this population may exploit a terrestrial diet highlights 
      potential conflicts for conserving Nile crocodiles outside protected areas.

TI  - Using grizzly bears to assess harvest-ecosystem tradeoffs in salmon fisheries.
PG  - e1001303
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001303 [doi]
LID - e1001303
AB  - Implementation of ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) requires a clear 
      conceptual and quantitative framework for assessing how different harvest options 
      can modify benefits to ecosystem and human beneficiaries. We address this 
      social-ecological need for Pacific salmon fisheries, which are economically 
      valuable but intercept much of the annual pulse of nutrient subsidies that salmon 
      provide to terrestrial and aquatic food webs. We used grizzly bears, vectors of 
      salmon nutrients and animals with densities strongly coupled to salmon abundance, 
      as surrogates for "salmon ecosystem" function. Combining salmon biomass and 
      stock-recruitment data with stable isotope analysis, we assess potential 
      tradeoffs between fishery yields and bear population densities for six sockeye 
      salmon stocks in Bristol Bay, Alaska, and British Columbia (BC), Canada. For the 
      coastal stocks, we find that both bear densities and fishery yields would 
      increase substantially if ecosystem allocations of salmon increase from currently 
      applied lower to upper goals and beyond. This aligning of benefits comes at a 
      potential cost, however, with the possibility of forgoing harvests in low 
      productivity years. In contrast, we detect acute tradeoffs between bear densities 
      and fishery yields in interior stocks within the Fraser River, BC, where biomass 
      from other salmon species is low. There, increasing salmon allocations to 
      ecosystems would benefit threatened bear populations at the cost of reduced 
      long-term yields. To resolve this conflict, we propose an EBFM goal that values 
      fisheries and bears (and by extension, the ecosystem) equally. At such targets, 
      ecosystem benefits are unexpectedly large compared with losses in fishery yields. 
      To explore other management options, we generate tradeoff curves that provide 
      stock-specific accounting of the expected loss to fishers and gain to bears as 
      more salmon escape the fishery. Our approach, modified to suit multiple 
      scenarios, provides a generalizable method to resolve conflicts over shared 
      resources in other systems.

AB  - Recurring polynyas are important areas of biological productivity and feeding 
      grounds for seabirds and mammals in the Arctic marine environment. In this study, 
      we examined food web structure (using carbon and nitrogen isotopes, δ(13)C and 
      δ(15)N) and mercury (Hg) bioaccumulation and biomagnification in a small 
      recurring polynya ecosystem near Nasaruvaalik Island (Nunavut, Canada). Methyl Hg 
      (MeHg) concentrations increased by more than 50-fold from copepods (Calanus 
      hyperboreus) to Arctic terns (Sterna paradisaea), the abundant predators at this 
      site. The biomagnification of MeHg through members of the food web - using the 
      slope of log MeHg versus δ(15)N - was 0.157 from copepods (C. hyperboreus) to 
      fish. This slope was higher (0.267) when seabird chicks were included in the 
      analyses. Collectively, our results indicate that MeHg biomagnification is 
      occurring in this small polynya and that its trophic transfer is at the lower end 
      of the range of estimates from other Arctic marine ecosystems. In addition, we 
      measured Hg concentrations in some poorly studied members of Arctic marine food 
      webs [e.g. Arctic alligatorfish (Ulcina olrikii) and jellyfish, Medusozoa], and 
      found that MeHg concentrations in jellyfish were lower than expected given their 
      trophic position. Overall, these findings provide fundamental information about 
      food web structure and mercury contamination in a small Arctic polynya, which 
      will inform future research in such ecosystems and provide a baseline against 
      which to assess changes over time resulting from environmental disturbance.

TI  - Partitioning and bioaccumulation of cadmium in artificial sediment systems: 
      application of a stable isotope tracer technique.
PG  - 543-51
AB  - The utility of stable isotope tracers for investigating the relationship between 
      cadmium (Cd) partitioning in artificial sediment-water systems and Cd 
      accumulation in a benthic detritivore (Asellus racovitzai, Isopoda) was explored. 
      In the laboratory, Cd isotopes were applied to synthetic sediment and isotope 
      concentrations were measured in sediment, overlying water and exposed asellids 
      over a 10-day period. Isotope ratios measured in sediment and water were compared 
      to ratios measured in asellids to determine whether Cd partitioning could predict 
      metal bioaccumulation. Two different parameters which might affect Cd 
      partitioning between the sediment and overlying water compartments were 
      investigated: the chemical form in which Cd was added to systems, and the organic 
      matter content of the sediment. To test the effect of chemical form on Cd 
      partitioning, three isotopes of cadmium were individually applied to formulated 
      sediment in varying combinations of 113Cd(NO3)2, 112Cd-humic acid (HA) 114CdSO4. 
      The results demonstrated that chemical form did not influence partitioning, as 
      the Cd isotope that was applied to sediment in the nitrate form exhibited similar 
      partitioning between sediment and overlying water as the isotope that was applied 
      in the sulfate or HA form. However, Cd isotope concentrations in overlying water 
      were strongly related to the pattern of isotope accumulation in asellids 
      suggesting that overlying water concentrations determined Cd bioaccumulation. In 
      contrast, when the organic matter content of sediment was increased through the 
      addition of Sphagnum peat moss, total Cd concentrations in overlying water and 
      tissue were low, and there was no relationship between Cd-isotope concentrations 
      in tissue and water. These results indicate that Cd accumulation occurred 
      primarily from water, and factors that increase metal partitioning to sediment, 
      such as increased sediment organic matter content, decrease Cd accumulation in 
      asellids. The stable isotope tracer method described herein appears to be a 
      useful technique for investigating the relationship between metal partitioning 
      and bioaccumulation in simple sediment systems, but could also be extended to 
      more complex systems, and used with different metals that have multiple stable 
      isotopes.

AB  - Farming domesticated millets, tending pigs, and hunting constituted the core of 
      human subsistence strategies during Neolithic Yangshao (5000-2900 BC). 
      Introduction of wheat and barley as well as the addition of domesticated 
      herbivores during the Late Neolithic (∼2600-1900 BC) led to restructuring of 
      ancient Chinese subsistence strategies. This study documents a dietary shift from 
      indigenous millets to the newly introduced cereals in northcentral China during 
      the Bronze Age Eastern Zhou Dynasty (771-221 BC) based on stable isotope analysis 
      of human and animal bone samples. Our results show that this change affected 
      females to a greater degree than males. We find that consumption of the newly 
      introduced cereals was associated with less consumption of animal products and a 
      higher rate of skeletal stress markers among females. We hypothesized that the 
      observed separation of dietary signatures between males and females marks the 
      rise of male-biased inequality in early China. We test this hypothesis by 
      comparing Eastern Zhou human skeletal data with those from Neolithic Yangshao 
      archaeological contexts. We find no evidence of male-female inequality in early 
      farming communities. The presence of male-biased inequality in Eastern Zhou 
      society is supported by increased body height difference between the sexes as 
      well as the greater wealth of male burials.

AB  - Sharks are top marine predators vital in maintaining ecosystem health and food 
      web structure. In order to assess tope shark (Galeorhinus galeus) trophic 
      ecology, stable isotope ratios and trace metal concentrations in muscle tissue 
      were determined, according to size and gender, for 124 individuals caught within 
      the Mid-Atlantic region. Data was complemented and analysed according to previous 
      stomach content information and compared with studies performed in the North East 
      Atlantic. Our results revealed that tope sharks fed at a low trophic level and 
      within a more pelagic-based food web when compared with other North Atlantic 
      regions. MixSIR application reflected its piscivorous diet and study area 
      topography, oligotrophic waters and volcanic nature, suggesting the occurrence of 
      a Mid-Atlantic tope shark population. Considering a non-anthropogenic volcanic 
      source for observed metal contents, the results reflect bioaccumulation and 
      suggest biomagnification processes for As and Hg. These metals exceeded 
      legislated maximum limits for some countries with a maximum of 28.98 ± 1.26 and 
      0.57 ± 0.01 mg kg(-1) wet weight, respectively, increasing significantly with 
      size for both males and females. Conversely, Cr, Rb and Zn were relatively stable 
      while Cd and Pb were not detected. Hg and Se were strongly correlated, suggesting 
      a Se toxicity mitigation role. Given the tope shark travel capacity and the 
      results obtained, the species may be used as a Mid-Atlantic bioindicator of 
      environmental quality.

AB  - The ecological integrity of freshwater lakes is influenced by atmospheric and 
      riverine deposition of contaminants, shoreline development, eutrophication, and 
      the introduction of non-native species. Changes to the trophic structure of Lake 
      Winnipeg, Canada, and consequently, the concentrations of contaminants and trace 
      elements measured in tissues of native fishes, are likely attributed to 
      agricultural runoff from the 977,800 km(2) watershed and the arrival of 
      non-native zooplankters and fishes. We measured δ(13)C, δ(15)N, and δ(34)S along 
      with concentrations of 15 trace elements in 17 native fishes from the north and 
      south basins of Lake Winnipeg in 2009 and 2010. After adjusting for differences 
      in isotopic baseline values between the two basins, fishes in the south basin had 
      consistently higher δ(13)C and δ(34)S, and lower δ(15)N. We found little evidence 
      of biomagnification of trace elements at the community level, but walleye (Sander 
      vitreus) and freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens) had higher mercury and 
      selenium concentrations with increased trophic position, coincident with 
      increased piscivory. There was evidence of growth dilution of cobalt, copper, 
      manganese, molybdenum, thallium, and vanadium, and bioaccumulation of mercury, 
      which could be explained by increases in algal (and consequently, lake and fish) 
      productivity. We conclude that the north and south basins of Lake Winnipeg 
      represent very different communities with different trophic structures and trace 
      element concentrations.

TI  - Dung beetles in an avian-dominated island ecosystem: feeding and trophic ecology.
PG  - 259-71
LID - 10.1007/s00442-014-3001-z [doi]
AB  - Globally, dung beetles (Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) are linked to many critical 
      ecosystem processes involving the consumption and breakdown of mammal dung. 
      Endemic New Zealand dung beetles (Canthonini) are an anomaly, occurring at high 
      abundance and low diversity on an island archipelago historically lacking 
      terrestrial mammals, except bats, and instead dominated by birds. Have New 
      Zealand's dung beetles evolved to specialise on bird dung or carrion, or have 
      they become broad generalist feeders? We test dietary preferences by analysing 
      nitrogen isotope ratios of wild dung beetles and by performing feeding behaviour 
      observations of captive specimens. We also use nitrogen and carbon stable 
      isotopes to determine if the dung beetle Saphobius edwardsi will consume 
      marine-derived carrion. Nitrogen isotope ratios indicated trophic generalism in 
      Saphobius dung beetles and this was supported by behavioural observations where a 
      broad range of food resources were utilised. Alternative food resource use was 
      further illustrated experimentally by nitrogen and carbon stable isotope 
      signatures of S. edwardsi, where individuals provided with decomposed squid had 
      δ(15)N and δ(13)C values that had shifted toward values associated with marine 
      diet. Our findings suggest that, in the absence of native mammal dung resources, 
      New Zealand dung beetles have evolved a generalist diet of dung and carrion. This 
      may include marine-derived resources, as provided by the seabird colonies present 
      in New Zealand forests before the arrival of humans. This has probably enabled 
      New Zealand dung beetles to persist in indigenous ecosystems despite the decline 
      of native birds and the introduction of many mammal species.

TI  - Baleen as a biomonitor of mercury content and dietary history of North Atlantic 
      minke whales (Balaenopetra acutorostrata): combining elemental and stable isotope 
      approaches.
PG  - 69-82
AB  - Baleen is an incrementally-growing tissue of balaenopteran whales which preserves 
      relatively well over time in museums and some archeological sites, and, therefore 
      might be useful for studies examining long-term changes of metal levels in 
      whales. This study examined Hg and stable C and N isotopic composition of baleen 
      plates of the North Atlantic minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), which 
      continues to be a food source for people in Greenland and elsewhere. We compared 
      the Hg levels and stable isotopes of major tissues (kidney, liver and muscle) 
      with those of baleen plates to see whether baleen could be used as a biomonitor 
      of variations of Hg intake and diet both between individuals and within 
      individuals over time. Mercury was significantly correlated with concentrations 
      in all tissues (kidney, liver and muscle). Stable C and N isotopes in baleen were 
      generally similar to those of muscle, which reflects the recent (approximately 
      one month) feeding of the whale, but in some individuals there were significant 
      differences between baleen and muscle. Sectioning of baleen into 1 cm 
      longitudinal increments showed that these differences were due to marked dietary 
      shifts by some individuals over time that had been recorded in the baleen but 
      were lost from the muscle record. Whole baleen C and N isotopes were better 
      correlated with tissue Hg levels, suggesting that baleen may provide a more 
      reliable indicator of long-term average diet, which in turn may be better related 
      to Hg accumulation in tissues than the shorter-term diet record contained in 
      muscle.

TI  - Stabilizing mechanisms in a food web with an introduced omnivore.
PG  - 5016-5025
LID - 10.1002/ece3.2773 [doi]
AB  - Intraguild predation (IGP) is an omnivorous food web configuration in which the 
      top predator consumes both a competitor (consumer) and a second prey that it 
      shares with the competitor. This omnivorous configuration occurs frequently in 
      food webs, but theory suggests that it is unstable unless stabilizing mechanisms 
      exist that can decrease the strength of the omnivore and consumer interaction. 
      Although these mechanisms have been documented in native food webs, little is 
      known about whether they operate in the context of an introduced species. Here, 
      we study a marine mussel aquaculture system where the introduction of omnivorous 
      mussels should generate an unstable food web that favors the extinction of the 
      consumer, yet it persists. Using field and laboratory approaches, we searched for 
      stabilizing mechanisms that could reduce interaction strengths in the food web. 
      While field zooplankton counts suggested that mussels influence the composition 
      and abundance of copepods, stable isotope results indicated that life-history 
      omnivory and cannibalism facilitated the availability of prey refugia, and 
      reduced competition and the interaction strength between the mussel omnivore and 
      zooplankton consumers. In laboratory experiments, however, we found no evidence 
      of adaptive feeding which could weaken predator-consumer interactions. Our food 
      web study suggests that the impact of an introduced omnivore may not only depend 
      on its interaction with native species but also on the availability of 
      stabilizing mechanisms that alter the strength of those interactions.

AB  - The long term dynamics of radiocesium in typical forest ecosystems was studied in 
      the radioactive contaminated areas in Fukushima Prefecture. Six observations 
      sites located in Yamakiya Village (Kawamata Town; since 2014), Tsushima Village 
      (Namie Town, since 2015), and Tomioka Town (since 2017) were monitored. The 
      forests consisted of artificial plantations of Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria 
      japonica) at Yamakiya Village, Tsushima Village, and Tomioka Town. Tsushima 
      Village also had a natural mixed forest dominated by Japanese red pine (Pinus 
      densiflora), and Tomioka Town had a young and a mature artificial plantation of 
      Japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis obtuse). Concentrations of (137)Cs were monitored 
      in the samples collected from the main aboveground biomass compartments, fresh 
      litterfall, forest litter, and soil. Concentrations of exchangeable forms of 
      (137)Cs and stable K were measured in soil samples. During the observation 
      period, the litter radiocesium inventories at all sites decreased significantly 
      to approximately 1% or less of the total ground deposition. Approximately 80% of 
      the total radiocesium inventory is localized in the upper 5-cm layer of soil and 
      there is little downward migration of radiocesium. At the sites with the longest 
      monitoring series (Yamakiya and Tsushima), the radiocesium expectation depths and 
      expectation mass depths were relatively constant at 2-3 cm and 5-6 kg m(-2), 
      respectively. Aboveground biomass compartments showed similar decreasing trends 
      in radiocesium aggregated transfer factors, T(ag), in the compartments that were 
      exposed to atmospheric fallout in March 2011 (old foliage, small branches, and 
      outer bark). The mean T(ag) in cedar stand compartments currently are in the 
      range of 10(-3)-10(-2) m(2) kg(-1) dw. However, the mean T(ag) and their dynamic 
      trend significantly differed in the wood compartments of the cedar stands, which 
      may indicate root uptake differences of orders of magnitude between observation 
      sites. The difference in radiocesium concentration in wood between the sites 
      becomes less pronounced when normalized by the ratio of exchangeable (137)Cs/K in 
      the soils.

PG  - 5137-46
LID - 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.07.038 [doi]
AB  - Total mercury (Hg) concentrations were measured in teeth of ringed seals from 
      Qeqertarsuaq, central West Greenland (1982 to 2006) and Ittoqqortoormiit, central 
      East Greenland (1986 to 2006). Stable isotopic ratios of carbon ((13)C/(12)C) and 
      nitrogen ((15)N/(14)N) were determined as well to provide insights into diet 
      variations between regions or through time. Mercury concentrations decreased the 
      first years of life of the animals suggesting that Hg had been transferred from 
      the mother to the foetus and newborn. The Hg concentrations in teeth were 
      significantly lesser in ringed seals from central West Greenland compared to 
      those from central East Greenland. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopic values 
      measured in the animals differed also significantly between the two regions. 
      Increasing temporal trends of dental Hg concentrations between 1994 and 2006 were 
      observed in ringed seals from both central West Greenland and central East 
      Greenland. These increases were attributed to global changes in environmental Hg 
      levels since no temporal trends in delta(15)N values were found to support the 
      hypothesis of a diet shift over time. Furthermore, a decreasing temporal trend in 
      delta(13)C values was observed in the teeth of seals from central East Greenland, 
      and explained by a likely change over time towards more pelagic feeding habits; 
      alternatively, the so-known Seuss effect was thought to be responsible for this 
      decrease. Finally, it was concluded that the tooth of ringed seal was a good 
      monitoring tissue to assess Hg trends.

AB  - The isotope ecology of great apes is a useful reference for palaeodietary

      habitats, variation in isotope signatures is assumed to be low compared to 
      hominoids exploiting C(4)-plant resources. However, isotopic differences between 
      sites and between and within individuals are poorly understood due to the lack of 
      vegetation baseline data. In this comparative study, we included all species of 
      free-ranging African great apes (Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus, Gorilla sp.). 
      First, we explore differences in isotope baselines across different habitats and 
      whether isotopic signatures in apes can be related to feeding niches (faunivory 
      and folivory). Secondly, we illustrate how stable isotopic variations within 
      African ape populations compare to other extant and extinct primates and discuss 
      possible implications for dietary flexibility. Using 701 carbon and nitrogen 
      isotope data points resulting from 148 sectioned hair samples and an additional 
      collection of 189 fruit samples, we compare six different great ape sites. We 
      investigate the relationship between vegetation baselines and climatic variables, 
      and subsequently correct great ape isotope data to a standardized plant baseline 
      from the respective sites. We obtained temporal isotopic profiles of individual 
      animals by sectioning hair along its growth trajectory. Isotopic signatures of 
      great apes differed between sites, mainly as vegetation isotope baselines were 
      correlated with site-specific climatic conditions. We show that controlling for 
      plant isotopic characteristics at a given site is essential for faunal data 
      interpretation. While accounting for plant baseline effects, we found distinct 
      isotopic profiles for each great ape population. Based on evidence from 
      habituated groups and sympatric great ape species, these differences could 
      possibly be related to faunivory and folivory. Dietary flexibility in apes 
      varied, but temporal variation was overall lower than in fossil hominins and 
      extant baboons, shifting from C(3) to C(4)-resources, providing new perspectives 
      on comparisons between extinct and extant primates.

AB  - Using stable isotope analysis, we investigated trophic interactions between 
      indigenous benthic taxa and the non-indigenous species (NIS): the green alga 
      Caulerpa cylindracea, the red alga Asparagopsis taxiformis, the crab Percnon 
      gibbesi and the sea hare Aplysia dactylomela. The study was conducted on 
      Lampedusa Island, Mediterranean Sea. We evaluated the trophic positions and 
      isotopic niches of consumers. Using Bayesian mixing models, we quantified the 
      food source contribution to diets of indigenous and non-indigenous herbivores. 
      Isotopic niche of NIS showed no overlap with the ones of indigenous 
      macroinvertebrates and fish. Caulerpa cylindracea provided the largest 
      contribution to the diet of P. gibbesi (0.431-1), while the dietary contribution 
      estimates overlapped considerably for all sources of A. dactylomela and 
      indigenous herbivores. From these results, we conclude that the invasion of 
      C. cylindracea is increasing the diversity of available prey and might facilitate 
      the expansion of other NIS.

AB  - We studied the food web structure and functioning of a coral reef ecosystem in 
      the Marquesas Islands, French Polynesia, characterized by low coral cover, high 
      sea surface temperature and meso- to eutrophic waters. The Marquesas constitute a 
      relevant ecosystem to understand the functioning of low diversity reefs that are 
      also subject to global change. A multi-tracer assessment of organic matter 
      pathways was run to delineate ecosystem functioning, using analysis of fatty 
      acids, bulk and compound specific stable isotope analysis and stable isotopes 
      mixing models. Macroalgae and phytoplankton were the two major food sources 
      fueling this food web with, however, some marked seasonal variations. 
      Specifically, zooplankton relied on phytoplankton-derived organic matter and 
      herbivorous fishes on macroalgae-derived organic matter to a much higher extent 
      in summer than in winter (~ 75% vs. ~ 15%, and ~ 70 to 75% vs. ~ 5 to 15%, 
      respectively) . Despite remarkably high δ(15)N values for all trophic 
      compartments, likely due to local dynamics in the nitrogen stock, trophic levels 
      of consumers were similar to those of other coral reef ecosystems. These findings 
      shed light on the functioning of low coral cover systems, which are expected to 
      expand worldwide under global change.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Current global warming affects the composition and dynamics of 
      mammalian communities and can increase extinction risk; however, long-term 
      effects of warming on mammals are less understood. Dietary reconstructions 
      inferred from stable isotopes of fossil herbivorous mammalian tooth enamel 
      document environmental and climatic changes in ancient ecosystems, including 
      C(3)/C(4) transitions and relative seasonality. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 
      Here, we use stable carbon and oxygen isotopes preserved in fossil teeth to 
      document the magnitude of mammalian dietary shifts and ancient floral change 
      during geologically documented glacial and interglacial periods during the 
      Pliocene (approximately 1.9 million years ago) and Pleistocene (approximately 1.3 
      million years ago) in Florida. Stable isotope data demonstrate increased aridity, 
      increased C(4) grass consumption, inter-faunal dietary partitioning, increased 
      isotopic niche breadth of mixed feeders, niche partitioning of phylogenetically 
      similar taxa, and differences in relative seasonality with warming. 
      CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data show that global warming resulted in dramatic 
      vegetation and dietary changes even at lower latitudes (approximately 28 degrees 
      N). Our results also question the use of models that predict the long term 
      decline and extinction of species based on the assumption that niches are 
      conserved over time. These findings have immediate relevance to clarifying 
      possible biotic responses to current global warming in modern ecosystems.

TI  - Variations in stable isotope fractionation of Hg in food webs of Arctic lakes.
PG  - 9148-54
LID - 10.1021/es901771r [doi]
AB  - Biotic and abiotic fractionation of mercury (Hg) isotopes has recently been shown 
      to occur in aquatic environments. We determined isotope ratios (IRs) of Hg in 
      food webs (zooplankton, chironomids, Arctic char) and sediments of 10 Arctic 
      lakes from four regions and investigated the extent of Hg isotope fractionation. 
      Hg IRs were analyzed by multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass 
      spectrometry (MC-ICP/MS). Hg mass independent fractionation (MIF; Delta(199)Hg) 
      and mass dependent fractionation (MDF; delta(202)Hg) were calculated and compared 
      among samples. IRs of Hg in sediment were characterized mainly by MDF and low MIF 
      (Delta(199)Hg -0.37 to 0.74 per thousand). However, all biota showed evidence of 
      MIF, most pronounced in zooplankton (Delta(199)Hg up to 3.40 per thousand) and 
      char (Delta(199)Hg up to 4.87 per thousand). Zooplankton takes up highly 
      fractionated MeHg directly from the water column, while benthic organisms are 
      exposed to sedimentary Hg, which contains less fractionated Hg. As evidenced by 
      delta(13)C measurements, benthic chironomids make up a large proportion of char 
      diet, explaining in part why MIF(char) < MIF(zooplankton) in lakes, where both 
      samples were measured. Hg IRs in char varied among regions, while char from lakes 
      from each region showed similar degrees of MIF. A MIF-offset was derived 
      representing the mean MIF difference between sediment and fish, and indicated 
      that fish in two regions retain sediment signatures altered by a consistent 
      offset. Due to its minimal lake-to-catchment area and very high water retention 
      time ( approximately 330 years), the meteor impact crater lake (Pingualuk) 
      reflects a "pure" atmospheric Hg signature, which is modified only by aqueous 
      in-lake processes. All other lakes are also affected by terrestrial Hg inputs and 
      sediment processes.

TI  - Impacts of zooplankton composition and algal enrichment on the accumulation of 
      mercury in an experimental freshwater food web.
PG  - 89-101
AB  - There is a well documented accumulation of mercury in fish to concentrations of 
      concern for human consumption. Variation in fish Hg burden between lakes is often 
      high and may result from differences in Hg transfer through lower levels of the 
      food web where mercury is bioconcentrated to phytoplankton and transferred to 
      herbivorous zooplankton. Prior research derived patterns of mercury accumulation 
      in freshwater invertebrates from field collected animals. This study provides 
      results from controlled mesocosm experiments comparing the effects of zooplankton 
      composition, algal abundance, and the chemical speciation of mercury on the 
      ability of zooplankton to accumulate mercury from phytoplankton and transfer that 
      mercury to planktivores. Experiments were conducted in 550-L mesocosms across a 
      gradient of algal densities manipulated by inorganic nutrient additions. 
      Enriched, stable isotopes of organic (CH3(200HgCl)) and inorganic (201HgCl2) 
      mercury were added to mesocosms and their concentrations measured in water, 
      seston, and three common zooplankton species. After 2 weeks, monomethylmercury 
      (MMHg) concentrations were two to three times lower in the two copepod species, 
      Leptodiaptomus minutus and Mesocyclops edax than in the cladoceran, Daphnia 
      mendotae. All three zooplankton species had higher MMHg concentrations in 
      mesocosms with low versus high initial algal abundance. However, despite higher 
      concentrations of inorganic mercury (HgI) in seston from low nutrient mesocosms, 
      there were no significant differences in the HgI accumulated by zooplankton 
      across nutrient treatments. Bioaccumulation factors for MMHg in the plankton were 
      similar to those calculated for plankton in natural lakes and a four-compartment 
      (aqueous, seston, macrozooplankton, and periphyton/sediments) mass balance model 
      after 21 days accounted for approximately 18% of the CH3(200Hg) and approximately 
      33% of the 201Hg added. Results from our experiments corroborate results from 
      field studies and suggest the importance of particular zooplankton herbivores 
      (e.g., Daphnia) in the transfer of Hg to higher trophic levels in aquatic food 
      webs.

TI  - Cascading effects of fishing can alter carbon flow through a temperate coastal 
      ecosystem.
PG  - 1874-87
AB  - Mounting evidence suggests that fishing can trigger trophic cascades and alter 
      food web dynamics, yet its effects on ecosystem function remain largely unknown. 
      We used the large-scale experimental framework of four marine reserves, spanning 
      an oceanographic gradient in northeastern New Zealand, to test the extent to 
      which the exploitation of reef predators can alter kelp carbon flux and secondary 
      production. We provide evidence that the reduction of predatory snapper (Pagrus 
      auratus) and lobster (Jasus edwardsii) can lead to an increase in sea urchins 
      (Evechinus chloroticus) and indirect declines in kelp biomass in some locations 
      but not others. Stable carbon isotope ratios (delta13C) of oysters (Crassostrea 
      gigas) and mussels (Perna canaliculus) transplanted in reserve and fished sites 
      within four locations revealed that fishing indirectly reduced the proportion of 
      kelp-derived organic carbon assimilated by filter feeders in two locations where 
      densities of actively grazing sea urchins were 23.7 and 8.3 times higher and kelp 
      biomass was an order of magnitude lower than in non-fished reserve sites. In 
      contrast, in the two locations where fishing had no effect on urchin density or 
      kelp biomass, we detected no effect of fishing on the carbon signature of filter 
      feeders. We show that the effects of fishing on nearshore trophic structure and 
      carbon flux are context-dependent and hinge on large-scale, regional 
      oceanographic factors. Where cascading effects of fishing on kelp biomass were 
      documented, enhanced assimilation of kelp carbon did not result in the 
      magnification of secondary production. Instead, a strong regional gradient in 
      filter feeder growth emerged, best predicted by chlorophyll a. Estimates of kelp 
      contribution to the diet of transplanted consumers averaged 56.9% +/- 6.2% (mean 
      +/- SE) for mussels and 33.8% +/- 7.3% for oysters, suggesting that organic 
      carbon fixed by kelp is an important food source fueling northeastern New 
      Zealand's nearshore food webs. The importance of predators in mediating benthic 
      primary production and organic carbon flux suggests that overfishing can have 
      profound consequences on ecosystem functioning particularly where pelagic primary 
      production is limiting. Our results underscore the broader ecosystem 
      repercussions of overfishing and its context-dependent effects.

TI  - Human pressures on two estuaries of the Iberian Peninsula are reflected in food

AB  - As a result of the increased urban and agricultural development in coastal 
      environments, estuaries are among the most modified and threatened aquatic 
      ecosystems. This study used stable isotopes to examine the effects of human 
      impacts by contrasting the food web structures of two Iberian estuaries exposed 
      to different degrees of human pressure. More complex feeding pathways were found 
      in the more altered estuary (Guadalquivir). Greater spread among species along 
      the carbon axis suggests that the primary consumers exploit organic matter with 
      various origins, whereas different nitrogen signals of the secondary consumers 
      suggest that they feed on different suites of prey. In contrast, the similar 
      isotopic signals of secondary consumers in the relatively little influenced 
      estuary (Guadiana) suggests similarity in diet composition and feeding on the 
      same organic matter sources. Understanding trophic interactions in estuaries is 
      vital for defining proper management and conservation, and the preliminary data 
      provided here are one step in this direction.

      to elevated atmospheric CO2.
PG  - 10938-42
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0912421107 [doi]
AB  - Rising atmospheric CO(2) levels are predicted to have major consequences on 
      carbon cycling and the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Increased 
      photosynthetic activity is expected, especially for C-3 plants, thereby 
      influencing vegetation dynamics; however, little is known about the path of fixed 
      carbon into soil-borne communities and resulting feedbacks on ecosystem function. 
      Here, we examine how arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) act as a major conduit in 
      the transfer of carbon between plants and soil and how elevated atmospheric CO(2) 
      modulates the belowground translocation pathway of plant-fixed carbon. Shifts in 
      active AMF species under elevated atmospheric CO(2) conditions are coupled to 
      changes within active rhizosphere bacterial and fungal communities. Thus, as 
      opposed to simply increasing the activity of soil-borne microbes through enhanced 
      rhizodeposition, elevated atmospheric CO(2) clearly evokes the emergence of 
      distinct opportunistic plant-associated microbial communities. Analyses involving 
      RNA-based stable isotope probing, neutral/phosphate lipid fatty acids stable 
      isotope probing, community fingerprinting, and real-time PCR allowed us to trace 
      plant-fixed carbon to the affected soil-borne microorganisms. Based on our data, 
      we present a conceptual model in which plant-assimilated carbon is rapidly 
      transferred to AMF, followed by a slower release from AMF to the bacterial and 
      fungal populations well-adapted to the prevailing (myco-)rhizosphere conditions. 
      This model provides a general framework for reappraising carbon-flow paths in 
      soils, facilitating predictions of future interactions between rising atmospheric 
      CO(2) concentrations and terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Amino acid (15) N analysis reveals change in the importance of freshwater 
      resources between the hunter-gatherer and farmer in the Neolithic upper Tigris.
PG  - 676-686
LID - 10.1002/ajpa.23783 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The inhabitants of several sites in the Upper Tigris Valley, such as 
      Hakemi Use, domesticated animals and cereals during the Pottery Neolithic period, 
      while the inhabitants in this valley were hunter-gatherers in the Pre-Pottery 
      Neolithic period, consuming freshwater and terrestrial food resources. However, 
      there is considerable uncertainty surrounding whether or not changes in dietary 
      food composition accompanied the shift in food production away from foraging. In 
      order to reveal the impact of the development of agriculture on the human diet 
      over the Pre-Pottery and Pottery Neolithic periods in this region, we analyzed 
      the isotopic compositions of amino acids from the farmers at the Hakemi Use 
      Pottery Neolithic site, and compared them with those from the Pre-Pottery 
      hunter-gatherers in the close region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Herein, we report 
      the nitrogen isotopic compositions of amino acids, as well as both carbon and 
      nitrogen isotopic compositions of bulk collagen, from human and faunal remains 
      collected from Hakemi Use. RESULTS: Whereas freshwater resources were consumed by 
      hunter-gatherers in this region during the Pre-Pottery period, the δ(15) N values 
      of glutamic acid (δ(15) N(Glu) ) and phenylalanine (δ(15) N(Phe) ) suggest that 
      freshwater food resources were rarely consumed by inhabitants following the 
      development of agriculture. DISCUSSION: Despite living in similar settings by the 
      Tigris as its inhabitants during the Pre-Pottery period, the farmers of the 
      Pottery Neolithic period depended less on freshwater resources for their diets 
      relative to the hunter-gatherers of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic period.

AB  - Biomagnification profiles of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 
      alkylphenols, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from the innermost part of 
      Tokyo Bay, Japan were analyzed using stable carbon (delta(13)C) and nitrogen 
      (delta(15)N) isotope ratios as guides to trophic web structure. delta(15)N 
      analysis indicated that all species of mollusks tested were primary consumers, 
      while decapods and fish were secondary consumers. Higher concentrations of PCBs 
      occurred in decapods and fish than in mollusks. In contrast, concentrations of 
      PAHs and alkylphenols were lower in decapods and fish than in mollusks. Unlike 
      PCBs, whose concentrations largely increased with increasing delta(15)N (i.e. 
      increasing trophic level), all PAHs and alkylphenols analyzed followed a reverse 
      trend. Molecular weights of PAHs are lower than those of PCBs, therefore low 
      membrane permeability caused by large molecular size is an unlikely factor in the 
      "biodilution" of PAHs. Organisms at higher trophic levels may rapidly metabolize 
      PAHs or they may assimilate less of them.

TI  - Zinc in an ultraoligotrophic lake food web.
PG  - 15422-15435
LID - 10.1007/s11356-018-1725-8 [doi]
AB  - Zinc (Zn) bioaccumulation and trophic transfer were analyzed in the food web of 
      Lake Nahuel Huapi, a deep, unpolluted ultraoligotrophic system in North 
      Patagonia. Benthic macroinvertebrates, plankton, and native and introduced fish 
      were collected at three sites. The effect of pyroclastic inputs on Zn levels in 
      lacustrine food webs was assessed by studying the impact of the eruption of 
      Puyehue-Cordón Caulle volcanic complex (PCCVC) in 2011, by performing three 
      sampling campaigns immediately before and after the PCCVC eruption, and after 
      2 years of recovery of the ecosystem. Zinc trophodynamics in L. Nahuel Huapi food 
      web was assessed using nitrogen stable isotopes (δ(15)N). There was no 
      significant increase of Zn concentrations ([Zn]) in L. Nahuel Huapi biota after 
      the PCCVC eruption, despite the evidence of [Zn] increase in lake water that 
      could be associated with volcanic ash leaching. The organisms studied exhibited 
      [Zn] above the threshold level considered for dietary deficiency, regulating Zn 
      adequately even under a catastrophic situations like PCCVC 2011 eruption. Zinc 
      concentrations exhibited a biodilution pattern in the lake's food web. To the 
      best of our knowledge, present research is the first report of Zn biodilution in 
      lacustrine systems, and the first to study Zn transfer in a freshwater food web 
      including both pelagic and benthic compartments.

TI  - Dietary variation in Icelandic arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) over a period of 
      30 years assessed through stable isotopes.
PG  - 403-414
LID - 10.1007/s00442-019-04580-0 [doi]
AB  - Identifying resources driving long-term trends in predators is important to 
      understand ecosystem changes and to manage populations in the context of 
      conservation or control. The arctic fox population in Iceland has increased 
      steadily over a period of 30 years, an increase that has been attributed to an 
      overall increase in food abundance. We hypothesized that increasing populations 
      of geese or seabirds were driving this growth. We analyzed stable isotopes in a 
      long-term series of collagen samples to determine the role of these different 
      resources. The isotopic signatures of arctic foxes differed consistently between 
      coastal and inland habitats. While δ(15)N displayed a non-linear change over time 
      with a slight increase in the first part of the period followed by a decline in 
      both habitats, δ(13)C was stable. Stable isotope mixing models suggested that 
      marine resources and rock ptarmigan were the most important dietary sources, with 
      marine resources dominating in coastal habitats and rock ptarmigan being more 
      important inland. Our results suggest that seabirds may have been driving the 
      arctic fox population increase. The rapidly increasing populations of breeding 
      geese seem to have played a minor role in arctic fox population growth, as rock 
      ptarmigan was the most important terrestrial resource despite a considerable 
      decrease in their abundance during recent decades. This study shows that a 
      long-term population trend in a generalist predator may have occurred without a 
      pronounced change in main dietary resources, despite ongoing structural changes 
      in the food web, where one species of herbivorous birds increased and another 
      decreased.

TI  - Trophic Strategies of a Non-Native and a Native Amphibian Species in Shared 
      Ponds.

AB  - One of the critical factors for understanding the establishment, success and 
      potential impact on native species of an introduced species is a thorough 
      knowledge of how these species manage trophic resources. Two main trophic 
      strategies for resource acquisition have been described: competition and 
      opportunism. In the present study our objective was to identify the main trophic 
      strategies of the non-native amphibian Discoglossus pictus and its potential 
      trophic impact on the native amphibian Bufo calamita. We determine whether D. 
      pictus exploits similar trophic resources to those exploited by the native B. 
      calamita (competition hypothesis) or alternative resources (opportunistic 
      hypothesis). To this end, we analyzed the stable isotope values of nitrogen and 
      carbon in larvae of both species, in natural ponds and in controlled laboratory 
      conditions. The similarity of the δ15N and δ13C values in the two species coupled 
      with isotopic signal variation according to pond conditions and niche 
      partitioning when they co-occurred indicated dietary competition. Additionally, 
      the non-native species was located at higher levels of trophic niches than the 
      native species and B. calamita suffered an increase in its standard ellipse area 
      when it shared ponds with D. pictus. These results suggest niche displacement of 
      B. calamita to non-preferred resources and greater competitive capacity of D. 
      pictus in field conditions. Moreover, D. pictus showed a broader niche than the 
      native species in all conditions, indicating increased capacity to exploit the 
      diversity of resources; this may indirectly favor its invasiveness. Despite the 
      limitations of this study (derived from potential variability in pond isotopic 
      signals), the results support previous experimental studies. All the studies 
      indicate that D. pictus competes with B. calamita for trophic resources with 
      potential negative effects on the fitness of the latter.

AB  - Late Pliocene climate changes have long been implicated in environmental changes 
      and mammalian evolution in Africa, but high-resolution examinations of the fossil 
      and climatic records have been hampered by poor sampling. By using fossils from 
      the well-dated Shungura Formation (lower Omo Valley, northern Turkana Basin, 
      southern Ethiopia), we investigate palaeodietary changes in one bovid and in one 
      suid lineage from 3 to 2 Ma using stable isotope analysis of tooth enamel. 
      Results show unexpectedly large increases in C(4) dietary intake around 2.8 Ma in 
      both the bovid and suid, and possibly in a previously reported hippopotamid 
      species. Enamel δ(13)C values after 2.8 Ma in the bovid (Tragelaphus nakuae) are 
      higher than recorded for any living tragelaphin, and are not expected given its 
      conservative dental morphology. A shift towards increased C(4) feeding at 2.8 Ma 
      in the suid (Kolpochoerus limnetes) appears similarly decoupled from a 
      well-documented record of dental evolution indicating gradual and progressive 
      dietary change. The fact that two, perhaps three, disparate Pliocene herbivore 
      lineages exhibit similar, and contemporaneous changes in dietary behaviour 
      suggests a common environmental driver. Local and regional pollen, palaeosol and 
      faunal records indicate increased aridity but no corresponding large and rapid 
      expansion of grasslands in the Turkana Basin at 2.8 Ma. Our results provide new 
      evidence supporting ecological change in the eastern African record around 2.8 
      Ma, but raise questions about the resolution at which different ecological 
      proxies may be comparable, the correlation of vegetation and faunal change, and 
      the interpretation of low δ(13)C values in the African Pliocene.

TI  - Uptake and Intraradical Immobilization of Cadmium by Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi 
      as Revealed by a Stable Isotope Tracer and Synchrotron Radiation μX-Ray 
      Fluorescence Analysis.
PG  - 257-263
LID - 10.1264/jsme2.ME18010 [doi]
AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can improve plant tolerance to heavy metal 
      contamination. This detoxification ability may largely depend on how AM fungi 
      influence the uptake and distribution of metals in host plants. Two experiments 
      were performed in order to gain insights into the mechanisms underlying cadmium 
      (Cd) tolerance in mycorrhizal plants. Stable isotope Cd(106) and compartmented 
      pots were adopted to quantify the contribution of the AM fungus, Rhizophagus 
      irregularis, to the uptake of Cd by Lotus japonicus. Moreover, synchrotron 
      radiation μX-ray fluorescence (SR-μXRF) was applied to localize Cd in the 
      mycorrhizal roots at the sub-cellular level. The results obtained indicated that 
      mycorrhizal colonization markedly enhanced Cd immobilization in plant roots. Less 
      Cd was partitioned to plant shoots when only hyphae had access to Cd in the 
      hyphal compartment than when roots also had direct access to the Cd pool. SR-μXRF 
      imaging indicated that Cd absorbed by extraradical hyphae was translocated into 
      intraradical fungal structures, in which arbuscules accumulated large amounts of 
      Cd; however, plant cells without fungal structures and plant cell walls contained 
      negligible amounts of Cd. The present results provide direct evidence for the 
      intraradical immobilization of Cd absorbed by AM fungi, which may largely 
      contribute to the enhanced tolerance of plants to Cd. Therefore, AM fungi may 
      play a role in the phytostabilization of Cd-contaminated soil.

TI  - Trophic redundancy among fishes in an East African nearshore seagrass community 
      inferred from stable-isotope analysis.
PG  - 490-509
LID - 10.1111/jfb.13354 [doi]
AB  - Stable-isotope analysis supplemented with stomach contents data from published 
      sources was used to quantify the trophic niches, trophic niche overlaps and 
      potential trophic redundancy for the most commonly caught fish species from an 
      East African nearshore seagrass community. This assessment is an important first 
      step in quantifying food-web structure in a region subject to intense fishing 
      activities. Nearshore food webs were driven by at least two isotopically distinct 
      trophic pathways, algal and seagrass, with a greater proportion of the sampled 
      species feeding within the seagrass food web (57%) compared with the algal food 
      web (33%). There was considerable isotopic niche overlap among species (92% of 
      species overlapped with at least one other species). Narrow isotopic niche widths 
      of most (83%) species sampled, low isotopic similarity (only 23% of species 
      exhibited no differences in δ(13) C and δ(15) N) and low predicted trophic 
      redundancy among fishes most commonly caught by fishermen (15%), however, suggest 
      that adjustments to resource management concerning harvesting and gear 
      selectivity may be needed for the persistence of artisanal fishing in northern 
      Tanzania. More detailed trophic studies paired with information on 
      spatio-temporal variation in fish abundance, especially for heavily targeted 
      species, will assist in the development and implementation of management 
      strategies to maintain coastal food-web integrity.

TI  - A Multitracer Approach to Quantifying Resource Utilization Strategies in Lake 
      Trout Populations in Lake Huron.
PG  - 1245-1255
LID - 10.1002/etc.4414 [doi]
AB  - Lake ecosystems are threatened by an array of stressors. An understanding of how 
      food webs and bioaccumulation dynamics respond to these challenges requires the 
      quantification of energy flow. We present a combined, multitracer approach using 
      both polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and stable isotopes to trace energy flow, 
      and to quantify how lake trout feeding strategies have adapted to changes in food 
      web structure in 3 basins of Lake Huron (ON, Canada). This combined tracer 
      approach allows the quantification of dietary proportions (using stable 
      isotopes), which are then integrated using a novel PCB tracer approach that 
      employs knowledge of PCB bioaccumulation pathways, to estimate consumption and 
      quantify energy flow between age cohorts of individual fish across Lake Huron. We 
      observed basin-specific differences in ultimate energy sources for lake trout, 
      with Georgian Bay lake trout deriving almost 70% of their energy from benthic 
      resources compared with 16 and 33% for Main Basin and North Channel lake trout, 
      respectively. These differences in resource utilization are further magnified 
      when they are contrasted with age. The dependency on pelagic energy sources in 
      the Main Basin and North Channel suggests that these populations will be the most 
      negatively affected by the ongoing trophic collapse in Lake Huron. Our study 
      demonstrates the utility of a multitracer approach to quantify the consequences 
      of food web adaptations to changes in aquatic ecosystems. Environ Toxicol Chem

TI  - Compound-specific stable isotopes of amino acids reveal influences of trophic

      Aleutian Islands, Alaska.

AB  - Total mercury concentrations ([THg]) exceed thresholds of concern in some Steller 
      sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus) tissues from certain portions of the Aleutian 
      Islands, Alaska. We applied compound-specific stable isotope analyses of both 
      carbon and nitrogen in amino acids from fish muscle tissue to quantify the 
      proportional contributions of primary production sources and trophic positions of 
      eight prey species (n = 474 total) that are part of Steller sea lion diets. 
      Previous THg analyses of fish muscle, coupled with monomethylmercury analyses of 
      a subset of samples, substantiated previous findings that fishes from the west of 
      Amchitka Pass, a discrete oceanographic boundary of the Aleutian Archipelago, 
      have higher muscle Hg concentrations relative to fishes from the east. The δ(13)C 
      values of essential amino acids (EAAs) in fish muscle demonstrated that although 
      most fishes obtained their EAAs primarily from algae, some species varied in the 
      extent to which they relied on this EAA source. The δ(15)N values of 
      phenylalanine (0.9 to 7.8 ‰), an indicator of the isotopic baseline of a food 
      web, varied widely within and among fish species. Trophic position estimates, 
      accounting for this baseline variation, were higher from the west relative to the 
      east of the pass for some fish species. Trophic magnification slopes using 
      baseline-corrected trophic position estimates indicated similar rates of Hg 
      biomagnification to the east and west of Amchitka Pass. Multiple linear 
      regression models revealed that trophic position was the most important driver of 
      fish muscle [THg] with less variation explained by other parameters. Thus, higher 
      trophic positions but not the rate of Hg biomagnification to the west of Amchitka 
      Pass may play a role in the regional differences in both fish and Steller sea 
      lion [THg]. Although, differences in Hg contamination and uptake at the base of 
      the east and west food webs could not be excluded.

TI  - The roles of food and water in the bioaccumulation of organochlorine compounds in 
      high mountain lake fish.
PG  - 4269-75
AB  - An integrated study encompassing the distribution of organochlorine compounds 
      (OC) in water, food web (chironomids, terrestrial insects, cladocerans, mollusks, 
      and cyanobacteria), and fish (brown trout) from a high mountain lake (Redon, 
      Pyrenees) is reported. OC distributions in these compartments have been 
      determined to assess theirtransport routes into fish. Food diets have been 
      estimated by analysis of fish stomach content and food web stable isotopes 
      (delta13C and delta15N). OCs with octanol--water partition coefficient (Kow) 
      higher than 10(6) showed lower concentrations in food than expected from 
      theoretical octanol--water partition, indicating thatthe distribution of these 
      compounds does not reach equilibrium within the life span of the food web 
      organisms (ca. 1 year). On the other hand, the degree of biomagnification in fish 
      increased with Kow, except in the case of the largest compound analyzed (seven 
      chlorine substituents, PCB #180). OC exchange at fish gill and gut has been 
      evaluated using a fugacity model based on the water, food, and fish 
      concentrations. All compounds exhibited a net gill loss and a net gut uptake. A 
      pseudostationary state was only achieved for compounds with log(Kow) < 6. 
      Calculation of fish average residence times for the compounds in apparent steady 
      state gave values of days to a few weeks for HCHs, 1 year for HCB and 4,4'-DDE, 
      and 2-3 years for 4,4'-DDT and PCB#28 and PCB#52. Residence times longer than one 
      decade were found for the more chlorinated PCB.

TI  - Arthropod food web restoration following removal of an invasive wetland plant.
PG  - 622-31
AB  - Restoration of habitats impacted by invasive plants is becoming an increasingly 
      important tool in the management of native biodiversity, though most studies do 
      not go beyond monitoring the abundance of particular taxonomic groups, such as 
      the return of native vegetation. Yet, the reestablishment of trophic interactions 
      among organisms in restored habitats is equally important if we are to monitor 
      and understand how ecosystems recover. This study examined whether food web 
      interactions among arthropods (as inferred by abundance of naturally occurring 
      stable isotopes of C [delta13C] and N [delta15N]) were reestablished in the 
      restoration of a coastal Spartina alterniflora salt marsh that had been invaded 
      by Phragmites australis. From patterns of C and N stable isotopes we infer that 
      trophic interactions among arthropods in the native salt marsh habitats are 
      characterized by reliance on the dominant marsh plant Spartina as a basal 
      resource. Herbivores such as delphacid planthoppers and mirid bugs have isotope 
      signatures characteristic of Spartina, and predatory arthropods such as 
      dolicopodid flies and spiders likewise have delta13C and delta15N signatures 
      typical of Spartina-derived resources (approximately -13 per thousand and 10 per 
      thousand, respectively). Stable isotope patterns also suggest that the invasion 
      of Phragmites into salt marshes and displacement of Spartina significantly alter 
      arthropod food web interactions. Arthropods in Phragmites-dominated sites have 
      delta13C isotope values between -18 per thousand and -20 per thousand, suggesting 
      reliance on detritus and/or benthic microalgae as basal resources and not on 
      Phragmites, which has a delta13C approximately -26 per thousand. Since most 
      Phragmites herbivores are either feeding internally or are rare transients from 
      nearby Spartina, these resources do not provide significant prey resources for 
      other arthropod consumers. Rather, predator isotope signatures in the invaded 
      habitats indicate dependence on detritus/algae as basal resources instead of the 
      dominant vegetation. The reestablishment of Spartina after removal of Phragmites, 
      however, not only returned species assemblages typical of reference (uninvaded) 
      Spartina, but stable isotope signatures suggest that the trophic interactions 
      among the arthropods were also similar in reestablished habitats. Specifically, 
      both herbivores and predators showed characteristic Spartina signatures, 
      suggesting the return of the original grazer-based food web structure in the 
      restored habitats.

AB  - Within areas of comparable atmospheric mercury deposition rates methylmercury 
      burden in largemouth bass populations vary significantly between regulated and 
      unregulated rivers. To investigate if trophic dynamics strongly influenced 
      pollutant body load, we sampled largemouth bass from two adjacent rivers, one 
      regulated and one unregulated, and applied a suite of biochemical and stable 
      isotope assays to compare their trophic dynamics. Total mercury burden in the 
      bass from the unregulated Sipsey River (Elrod, AL, USA) and the regulated Black 
      Warrior River (Demopolis, AL, USA) averaged 0.87 mg kg(-1) and 0.19 mg kg(-1) wet 
      weight, respectively. For both populations, age, weight, and length were 
      positively correlated with muscle mercury concentration. Compound specific stable 
      isotope analysis of amino acids showed the trophic position of both populations 
      was just under four. Quantitative and isotopic analysis of neutral lipid fatty 
      acid of Sipsey River bass indicated a greater reliance upon the detrital 
      component of the food web compared to Demopolis Reservoir bass which fed within 
      the autochthonous, pelagic component of the food web. Since the close proximity 
      of the rivers makes differences in atmospheric deposition unlikely and both 
      populations had similar trophic position, our findings indicate that food web 
      dynamics should be included among the factors that can strongly influence mercury 
      concentration in fish.

TI  - Do stable isotopes reflect the food web development in regenerating ecosystems?
PG  - 285-301
AB  - We evaluated the use of delta15N- and delta13C-values to monitor the development 
      of food web complexity and biodiversity in a regenerating ecosystem. Therefore a 
      model food chain was established feeding cultivated woodlice (Porcellio 
      dilatatus) on a cellulolytic fungus (Chaetomium globosum) grown on cellulose 
      paper. Two diets of different quality (C:N ratios of 54 vs. 200) with different 
      delta15N- (1.3% vs. 3.1%) but identical delta13C-values caused low and high 
      dietary stress in animals of treatment A and B, respectively. After an incubation 
      time of 7 weeks amount, elemental and isotopic composition of collected faeces 
      and exuviae as well as woodlice and remaining food were determined. The increase 
      of delta15N-values of woodlice relative to the diet was 5.7% and 2.5% in 
      treatments A and B, respectively, whereas delta13C-shifts were 1.0% and 1.6%, 
      showing a reverse relationship. Modelling of elemental and isotopic mass balances 
      indicated that faeces recycling explains the unexpected high 15N-enrichments. 
      Moreover, 13C-enrichments were positively correlated to the degree of starvation. 
      Considering the effects of starvation and recycling of faeces, stable isotopes 
      represent a useful tool to elucidate trophic interactions in regenerating food 
      webs.

TI  - Levels and distribution of polybrominated diphenyl ethers in the aquatic and

PG  - 16440-7

AB  - The distribution and fate of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in a riparian 
      ecosystem nearby a wastewater treatment plant effluent were investigated. 
      Different aqueous and terrestrial samples such as soil, sediment, plants, and 
      invertebrates were collected and analyzed for tri- to heptabrominated PBDEs. 
      Furthermore, the food web structure was elucidated using stable carbon and 
      nitrogen isotopes. The highest PBDE levels were found for sediment- and 
      soil-dwelling invertebrates, such as earthworms (Σ13 PBDEs 144 ng/g lipid 
      weight), Tubifex tubifex (77 ng/g lw), and scarab larvae (49 ng/g lw). 
      Differences in congener composition profiles among the different matrices show 
      that the environmental distribution and fate of PBDEs in ecosystems can be very 
      complex. Among the analyzed PBDEs in this ecosystem, the tetra-brominated BDE-47 
      was the dominant PBDE congener and followed by the penta-brominated BDE-99. A 
      potential trend of increasing BDE-47/99 ratio with the increase of δ(15)N was 
      observed for species with similar energy sources (δ(13)C), indicating a higher 
      bioaccumulation potential for BDE-47 in this ecosystem. A significant correlation 
      was also found between PBDEs and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), indicating 
      similar sources and fate between the two compound groups in this area. The 
      biota-soil or biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs) were somewhat different 
      among the PBDE congeners and species, but were generally highest for those with 
      log Kow values around 6.5-7.

TI  - Contribution of sea ice microbial production to Antarctic benthic communities is 
      driven by sea ice dynamics and composition of functional guilds.
PG  - 3642-3653
LID - 10.1111/gcb.14291 [doi]
AB  - Organic matter produced by the sea ice microbial community (SIMCo) is an 
      important link between sea ice dynamics and secondary production in near-shore 
      food webs of Antarctica. Sea ice conditions in McMurdo Sound were quantified from 
      time series of MODIS satellite images for Sept. 1 through Feb. 28 of 2007-2015. A 
      predictable sea ice persistence gradient along the length of the Sound and 
      evidence for a distinct change in sea ice dynamics in 2011 were observed. We used 
      stable isotope analysis (δ(13) C and δ(15) N) of SIMCo, suspended particulate 
      organic matter (SPOM) and shallow water (10-20 m) macroinvertebrates to reveal 
      patterns in trophic structure of, and incorporation of organic matter from SIMCo 
      into, benthic communities at eight sites distributed along the sea ice 
      persistence gradient. Mass-balance analysis revealed distinct trophic 
      architecture among communities and large fluxes of SIMCo into the near-shore food 
      web, with the estimates ranging from 2 to 84% of organic matter derived from 
      SIMCo for individual species. Analysis of patterns in density, and biomass of 
      macroinvertebrate communities among sites allowed us to model net incorporation 
      of organic matter from SIMCo, in terms of biomass per unit area (g/m(2) ), into 
      benthic communities. Here, organic matter derived from SIMCo supported 39 to 71 
      per cent of total biomass. Furthermore, for six species, we observed declines in 
      contribution of SIMCo between years with persistent sea ice (2008-2009) and years 
      with extensive sea ice breakout (2012-2015). Our data demonstrate the vital role 
      of SIMCo in ecosystem function in Antarctica and strong linkages between sea ice 
      dynamics and near-shore secondary productivity. These results have important 
      implications for our understanding of how benthic communities will respond to 
      changes in sea ice dynamics associated with climate change and highlight the 
      important role of shallow water macroinvertebrate communities as sentinels of 
      change for the Antarctic marine ecosystem.

TI  - Invasive cordgrass modifies wetland trophic function.
PG  - 419-32
AB  - Vascular plants strongly control belowground environments in most ecosystems. 
      Invasion by vascular plants in coastal wetlands, and by cordgrasses (Spartina 
      spp.) in particular, are increasing in incidence globally, with dramatic 
      ecosystem-level consequences. We examined the trophic consequences of invasion by 
      a Spartina hybrid (S. alterniflora x S. foliosa) in San Francisco Bay (USA) by 
      documenting differences in biomass and trophic structure of benthic communities 
      between sediments invaded by Spartina and uninvaded sediments. We found the 
      invaded system shifted from an algae-based to a detritus-based food web. We then 
      tested for a relationship between diet and tolerance to invasion, hypothesizing 
      that species that consume Spartina detritus are more likely to inhabit invaded 
      sediments than those that consume surface algae. Infaunal diets were initially 
      examined with natural abundance stable isotope analyses and application of mixing 
      models, but these yielded an ambiguous picture of food sources. Therefore, we 
      conducted isotopic enrichment experiments by providing 15N-labeled Spartina 
      detritus both on and below the sediment surface in areas that either contained 
      Spartina or were unvegetated. Capitellid and nereid polychaetes, and 
      oligochaetes, groups shown to persist following Spartina invasion of San 
      Francisco Bay tidal flats, took up 15N from labeled native and invasive Spartina 
      detritus. In contrast, we found that amphipods, bivalves, and other taxa less 
      tolerant to invasion consumed primarily surficial algae, based on 13C enrichment 
      experiments. Habitat (Spartina vs. unvegetated patches) and location of detritus 
      (on or within sediments) did not affect 15N uptake from detritus. Our 
      investigations support a "trophic shift" model for ecosystem response to wetland 
      plant invasion and preview loss of key trophic support for fishes and migratory 
      birds by shifting dominance to species not widely consumed by species at higher 
      trophic levels.

      regulated Colorado River USA.
PG  - 179-91
AB  - Dual stable isotope analysis in the regulated Colorado River through Grand Canyon 
      National Park, USA, revealed a food web that varied spatially through this arid 
      biome. Down-river enrichment of delta13C data was detected across three trophic 
      levels resulting in shifted food webs. Humpack chub delta13C and delta15N values 
      from muscle plugs and fin clips did not differ significantly. Humpback chub and 
      rainbow trout trophic position is positively correlated with standard length 
      indicating an increase in piscivory by larger fishes. Recovery of the aquatic 
      community from impoundment by Glen Canyon Dam and collecting refinements for 
      stable isotope analysis within large rivers are discussed.

AB  - In temperate regions of Canada, mercury (Hg) concentrations in biota and the 
      magnitude of Hg biomagnification through food webs vary between neighboring lakes 
      and are related to water chemistry variables and physical lake features. However, 
      few studies have examined factors affecting the variable Hg concentrations in 
      landlocked Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) or the biomagnification of Hg through 
      their food webs. We estimated the food web structure of six high Arctic lakes 
      near Resolute Bay, Nunavut, Canada, using stable carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen 
      (δ(15)N) isotopes and measured Hg (total Hg (THg) in char, the only fish species, 
      and methylmercury (MeHg) in chironomids and zooplankton) concentrations in biota 
      collected in 2010 and 2011. Across lakes, δ(13)C showed that benthic carbon 
      (chironomids) was the dominant food source for char. Regression models of log Hg 
      versus δ(15)N (of char and benthic invertebrates) showed positive and significant 
      slopes, indicting Hg biomagnification in all lakes, and higher slopes in some 
      lakes than others. However, no principal components (PC) generated using all 
      water chemistry data and physical characteristics of the lakes predicted the 
      different slopes. The PC dominated by aqueous ions was a negative predictor of 
      MeHg concentrations in chironomids, suggesting that water chemistry affects Hg 
      bioavailability and MeHg concentrations in these lower-trophic-level organisms. 
      Furthermore, regression intercepts were predicted by the PCs dominated by 
      catchment area, aqueous ions, and MeHg. Weaker relationships were also found 
      between THg in small char or MeHg in pelagic invertebrates and the PCs dominated 
      by catchment area, and aqueous nitrate and MeHg. Results from these high Arctic 
      lakes suggest that Hg biomagnification differs between systems and that their 
      physical and chemical characteristics affect Hg concentrations in 
      lower-trophic-level biota.

AB  - Understanding changes in environmental mercury concentrations is important for 
      assessing the risk to human and wildlife populations from this potent toxicant. 
      Here, we use herring gull (Larus argentatus) eggs to evaluate temporal changes in 
      total mercury (THg) availability from two locations on Great Slave Lake (GSL), 
      Northwest Territories, Canada. Egg THg concentrations increased through time, but 
      this change was due to shifts in gull diets. Stable nitrogen isotopes allowed 
      adjustment of egg THg concentrations for dietary changes. Diet-adjusted egg THg 
      concentrations showed no long-term trend. Consistent with that result, new 
      statistical analysis of THg concentrations in three species of GSL fish showed 
      minor or no temporal changes. Although a long-term trend was absent, inter-year 
      differences in adjusted egg THg concentrations persisted. Contributions of 
      environmental variables (i.e., river flow, lake level, air temperature, 
      precipitation, and wildfire) to these differences were investigated. Egg THg 
      concentrations were greater following years of lower lake levels and greater 
      wildfire extent. Lake level could have affected mercury methylation. Increased 
      wildfire could have enhanced terrestrial Hg releases to the atmosphere where it 
      was transported long distances to GSL. Climate change may increase wildfire 
      extent with impacts on Hg bioaccumulation in northern ecosystems. Egg Hg levels 
      reported here are unlikely to pose health risks to gulls, but in light of ongoing 
      environmental change, monitoring should continue. Our study emphasizes the 
      importance of ancillary datasets in elucidating Hg trends; such information will 
      be critical for evaluating the effectiveness of Hg mitigation strategies 
      implemented as part of the Minamata Convention.

TI  - Reduced dry season transpiration is coupled with shallow soil water use in

AB  - Tropical montane cloud forests (TMCF) are ecosystems particularly sensitive to 
      climate change; however, the effects of warmer and drier conditions on TMCF 
      ecohydrology remain poorly understood. To investigate functional responses of 
      TMCF trees to reduced water availability, we conducted a study during the 2014 
      dry season in the lower altitudinal limit of TMCF in central Veracruz, Mexico. 
      Temporal variations of transpiration, depth of water uptake and tree water 
      sources were examined for three dominant, brevi-deciduous species using 
      micrometeorological, sap flow and soil moisture measurements, in combination with 
      oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope composition of rainfall, tree xylem, soil and 
      stream water. Over the course of the dry season, reductions in crown conductance 
      and transpiration were observed in canopy species (43 and 34%, respectively) and 
      mid-story trees (23 and 8%), as atmospheric demand increased and soil moisture 
      decreased. Canopy species consistently showed more depleted isotope values 
      compared to mid-story trees. However, MixSIAR Bayesian model results showed that 
      the evaporated (enriched) soil water pool was the main source for trees despite 
      reduced soil moisture. Additionally, while increases in tree water uptake from 
      deeper to shallower soil water sources occurred, concomitant decreases in 
      transpiration were observed as the dry season progressed. A larger reduction in 
      deep soil water use was observed for canopy species (from 79 ± 19 to 24 ± 20%) 
      compared to mid-story trees (from 12 ± 17 to 10 ± 12%). The increase in shallower 
      soil water sources may reflect a trade-off between water and nutrient 
      requirements in this forest.

AB  - Food web structure is shaped by interactions within and across trophic levels. As 
      such, understanding how the presence and absence of predators, prey, and 
      competitors affect species foraging patterns is important for predicting the 
      consequences of changes in species abundances, distributions, and behaviors. 
      Here, we used plasma δ(13)C and δ(15)N values from juvenile blacktip reef sharks 
      (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and juvenile sicklefin lemon sharks (Negaprion 
      acutidens) to investigate how species co-occurrence affects their trophic 
      interactions in littoral waters of Moorea, French Polynesia. Co-occurrence led to 
      isotopic niche partitioning among sharks within nurseries, with significant 
      increases in δ(15)N values among sicklefin lemon sharks, and significant 
      decreases in δ(15)N among blacktip reef sharks. Niche segregation likely promotes 
      coexistence of these two predators during early years of growth and development, 
      but data do not suggest coexistence affects life history traits, such as body 
      size, body condition, and ontogenetic niche shifts. Plasticity in trophic niches 
      among juvenile blacktip reef sharks and sicklefin lemon sharks also suggests 
      these predators are able to account for changes in community structure, resource 
      availability, and intra-guild competition, and may fill similar functional roles 
      in the absence of the other species, which is important as environmental change 
      and human impacts persist in coral reef ecosystems.

TI  - Stable isotopes reveal spatial variability in the trophic structure of a 
      macro-benthic invertebrate community in a tropical coral reef.

AB  - RATIONALE: Studies of organic matter fluxes in coral reefs are historically based 
      on physical and biogeochemical approaches. It is important to link these 
      approaches to community analysis as the abundance and behaviour of species, 
      populations or trophic groups can have a profound effect on nutrient budgets. 
      METHODS: We determined the carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions of coral 
      reef organic matter sources and macro-benthic invertebrate communities using a 
      Europa Geo 20/20 isotope ratio mass spectrometer interfaced to an ANCA-SL 
      elemental analyzer in continuous flow mode. Isotopic ecology metrics and a mixing 
      model were used to analyze and interpret the data. RESULTS: The coral reef 
      macro-invertebrate community principally relies on detrital or recycled food 
      sources. An increased reliance on reef nitrogen-derived sources was observed in 
      the cold-dry season. The community food-web lengths differ noticeably across the 
      coral reef and reflect the characteristics and origin of organic matter 
      reservoirs. CONCLUSIONS: Anthropogenic and terrestrial inputs lead to a loss of 
      biological diversity. Exclusive dominance of suspension-feeding species is 
      observed in areas receiving direct surface riverine particulate organic matter. 
      The accumulation of sediment organic matter in eutrophic areas leads to dominance 
      of deposit-feeding species. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Mercury bioaccumulation is frequently observed in marine ecosystems, often with 
      stronger effects at higher trophic levels. We compared total mercury (THg) and 
      methylmercury (MeHg) from muscle with length, comparative isotopic niche, and 
      diet (via δ(13)C and δ(15)N) among four sympatric coastal sharks in Florida Bay 
      (USA): blacknose, blacktip, bull, and lemon. Mercury in blacknose and blacktip 
      sharks increased significantly with size, whereas bull and lemon sharks had a 
      high variance in mercury relative to size. Both δ(13)C and δ(15)N were consistent 
      with general resource use and trophic position relationships across all species. 
      A significant relationship was observed between δ(13)C and mercury in blacktip 
      sharks, suggesting an ontogenetic shift isotopic niche, possibly a dietary 
      change. Multiple regression showed that δ(13)C and δ(15)N were the strongest 
      factors regarding mercury bioaccumulation in individuals across all species. 
      Additional research is recommended to resolve the mechanisms that determine 
      mercury biomagnification in individual shark species.

TI  - Rapidly increasing methyl mercury in endangered ivory gull (Pagophila eburnea)

LID - 20150032
AB  - Mercury (Hg) is increasing in marine food webs, especially at high latitudes. The 
      bioaccumulation and biomagnification of methyl mercury (MeHg) has serious effects 
      on wildlife, and is most evident in apex predators. The MeHg body burden in birds 
      is the balance of ingestion and excretion, and MeHg in feathers is an effective 
      indicator of overall MeHg burden. Ivory gulls (Pagophila eburnea), which consume 
      ice-associated prey and scavenge marine mammal carcasses, have the highest egg Hg 
      concentrations of any Arctic bird, and the species has declined by more than 80% 
      since the 1980s in Canada. We used feathers from museum specimens from the 
      Canadian Arctic and western Greenland to assess whether exposure to MeHg by ivory 
      gulls increased from 1877 to 2007. Based on constant feather stable-isotope 
      (δ(13)C, δ(15)N) values, there was no significant change in ivory gulls' diet 
      over this period, but feather MeHg concentrations increased 45× (from 0.09 to 
      4.11 µg g(-1) in adults). This dramatic change in the absence of a dietary shift 
      is clear evidence of the impact of anthropogenic Hg on this high-latitude 
      threatened species. Bioavailable Hg is expected to increase in the Arctic, 
      raising concern for continued population declines in high-latitude species that 
      are far from sources of environmental contaminants.

      community.
PG  - 14-26
LID - 10.1111/1574-6941.12090 [doi]
AB  - We identified phylotypes performing distinct functions related to benzene 
      degradation in complex microbial biofilms from an aerated treatment pond 
      containing coconut textile. RNA- and protein-stable isotope probing (SIP) and 
      compound-specific stable isotope analysis were applied to delineate bacteria and 
      predominant pathways involved in the degradation of benzene. In laboratory 
      microcosms, benzene was degraded at rates of ≥ 11 μM per day and per gram coconut 
      textile under oxic conditions. Carbon isotope fractionation with isotopic 
      enrichment factors (ε) of -0.6 to -1‰ and no significant hydrogen isotope 
      fractionation indicated a dihydroxylation reaction for the initial ring attack. 
      The incubation with [(13)C₆]-benzene led to (13)CO₂ formation accompanied by 
      (13)C-labeling of RNA and proteins of the active biomass. Phylogenetic analysis 
      of the (13)C-labeled RNA revealed that phylotypes related to Zoogloea, 
      Ferribacterium, Aquabacterium, and Hydrogenophaga within the Betaproteobacteria 
      predominantly assimilated carbon from benzene. Although the phylogenetic 
      classification of identified (13)C-labeled proteins was biased by the incomplete 
      metagenome information of public databases, it matched with RNA-SIP results at 
      genus level. The detection of (13)C-labeled proteins related to toluene 
      dioxygenase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase suggests benzene degradation by a 
      dihydroxylation pathway with subsequent meta-cleavage of formed catechol.

AB  - Few studies have addressed how the diversity of basal resources change with 
      stream regulation and the potential consequences on river biota. We sampled 
      invertebrates above and below a series of dams, over two years, at both 
      downwelling and upwelling zones. In each zone, we recorded the daily temperature 
      and flow variations, estimated the algal development, measured the available 
      resources, and analysed carbon and nitrogen stable isotope compositions of the 
      invertebrate community. The number of hydrological pulses were typically higher 
      below the dams than above the dams especially during high-flow periods whereas 
      the groundwater outlets had minor effects on invertebrate assemblages. 
      Invertebrate abundance, richness and diversity tended to decrease below the dams. 
      Co-inertia analysis showed that flow and temperature variations, and 
      eutrophication explained most of the variance in the invertebrate assemblages, 
      which comprised a higher number of resilient taxa below than above the dams. The 
      proportions of pesticide-sensitive invertebrates were lower below the dams and 
      ovoviviparous and more generalist taxa were prominent. We did not observe the 
      expected CPOM decrease and FPOM increase downstream. Accordingly, the proportions 
      of each functional feeding group were remarkably similar above and below the dams 
      despite the long distance between the sectors (>100 kms). The diversity of basal 
      resources used within assemblages progressively increased downstream above dams. 
      In contrast, the diversity of resources used by organisms below the dams 
      decreased from upstream to downstream suggesting a significant influence of flow 
      regulation on aquatic food webs. Finally, the shorter trophic chains for the 
      invertebrate assemblages below the dams suggests that the effects of stream 
      regulation and eutrophication induced a simplification of food webs. To our 
      knowledge, this study is the first to connect taxonomic and functional trait 
      changes in response to multiple stressors with the associated modifications in 
      isotopic niches within aquatic invertebrate assemblages. CONTEXT: Understanding 
      how stream regulation and associated anthropogenic pressures act on aquatic 
      assemblages and trophic niches is necessary to guide management actions. GOAL: We 
      aimed to investigate the functional responses (traits and trophic niches) of 
      aquatic invertebrate assemblages to stream regulation and eutrophication. 
      METHODS: We used univariate and multivariate analyses to compare the invertebrate 
      assemblages above and below the dams and to assess the contributions of hydrology 
      (including groundwater supplies to the river), temperature and eutrophication to 
      the variability in the composition of invertebrate assemblages. We also 
      considered the relative utilization of a selected set of traits describing 
      invertebrate resilience, resistance and specialization to address the potential 
      functional effects of stream regulation on invertebrate assemblages. Finally, 
      carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses allowed us to characterize the length and 
      width of invertebrate assemblage food webs as related to the availability and 
      diversity of basal resources. RESULTS: Invertebrate abundance and richness 
      generally decreased below the dams, with the highest impacts on insect taxa. 
      Co-inertia analysis showed that stream regulation and eutrophication were main 
      drivers of the aquatic invertebrate assemblages. The analysis separated the sites 
      above and below the dams according to flow and temperature variation, whereas 
      eutrophication appeared as a secondary stressor that separated the sites within 
      each sector. Furthermore, the series of dams resulted in (i) a higher proportion 
      of resilient (e.g., multivoltine) and resistant (ovoviviparous) taxa and a 
      majority of generalists in assemblages below dams, (ii) an impact on the 
      classical dynamics of CPOM (decrease) and FPOM (increase) sources from upstream 
      to downstream, and (iii) a reduction in the diversity of resource use and in the 
      trophic chain length of invertebrate assemblages below dams. The cooler and less 
      oxygenated upwelling zones had lower invertebrate abundance; however, contrary to 
      our expectation, the variation in the groundwater supply did not affect the 
      composition of epigean invertebrate assemblages. CONCLUSION: This study provides 
      insights about the impacts of flow regime alteration and eutrophication on food 
      webs that may have been caused by regulation of permanent streams. To our 
      knowledge, this is the first to connect taxonomic and functional trait changes in 
      response to multiple stressors with the associated modifications in energy fluxes 
      in aquatic invertebrate assemblages. This study suggests that bed stability, 
      which is associated with a reduction in channel mobility below the dams and with 
      moderate eutrophication, may provide the shelter and resources that can locally 
      favour invertebrate assemblage dynamics and lessen the effects of flow 
      regulation. In addition, the study suggests that the biological trait-based 
      approach and isotope analysis are complementary approaches for addressing 
      ecosystem functioning. The relative utilization of traits indicates the 
      functional potential of aquatic invertebrate assemblages to face multiple 
      stressors whereas isotope analysis is an expression of the actual effect of the 
      stressors on the trophic structure of aquatic invertebrate assemblages.

TI  - Mercury biomagnification in subtropical reservoir fishes of eastern China.
PG  - 133-46

AB  - Little is known about mercury (Hg) biomagnification in the subtropics, aquatic 
      systems with high species diversity resulting in complex food webs. High 
      atmospheric Hg emissions and ubiquitous reservoir fisheries may lead to elevated 
      Hg bioaccumulation in Chinese freshwater fishes. However, stocking practices 
      using fast-growing species can result in low fish total Hg (THg) concentrations. 
      Here, we describe Hg transfer within the fish food web of a large subtropical 
      reservoir, Qiandao Hu (Xin'anjiang reservoir) situated in eastern China. We 
      measured food web Hg biomagnification and THg concentrations in 33 species of 
      stocked and wild fishes. Mercury concentrations in most fishes were low, though 
      we also found high Hg concentrations in wild top predators. The food web 
      structure, assessed using stable isotopes of carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen 
      (δ(15)N), demonstrated a high degree of omnivory and a long food chain. THg 
      concentrations were highly correlated with fish δ(15)N values. The regression of 
      log10THg against δ(15)N revealed the overall Hg biomagnification rate was low. 
      This study shows that where long food chains exist in subtropical reservoirs, 
      elevated Hg accumulation in top predators can occur despite a low Hg 
      biomagnification rate.

      Estimating Consumer Allochthony in Two Shallow Eutrophic Lakes.

AB  - Hydrogen stable isotopes (δ2H) have recently been used to complement δ13C and 
      δ15N in food web studies due to their potentially greater power to separate 
      sources of organic matter in aquatic food webs. However, uncertainties remain 
      regarding the use of δ2H, since little is known about the potential variation in 
      the amount of exchangeable hydrogen (Hex) among common sample materials or the 
      patterns of δ2H when entire food webs are considered. We assessed differences in 
      Hex among the typical sample materials in freshwater studies and used δ2H, δ13C 
      and δ15N to compare their effectiveness in tracing allochthonous matter in food 
      webs of two small temperate lakes. Our results showed higher average amounts of 
      Hex in animal tissues (27% in fish and macroinvertebrates, 19% in zooplankton) 
      compared to most plant material (15% in terrestrial plants and 8% in 
      seston/periphyton), with the exception of aquatic vascular plants (23%, referred 
      to as macrophytes). The amount of Hex correlated strongly with sample lipid 
      content (inferred from C:N ratios) in fish and zooplankton samples. Overall, the 
      three isotopes provided good separation of sources (seston, periphyton, 
      macrophytes and allochthonous organic matter), particularly the δ2H followed by 
      δ13C. Aquatic macrophytes revealed unexpectedly high δ2H values, having more 
      elevated δ2H values than terrestrial organic matter with direct implications for 
      estimating consumer allochthony. Organic matter from macrophytes significantly 
      contributed to the food webs in both lakes highlighting the need to include 
      macrophytes as a potential source when using stable isotopes to estimate trophic 
      structures and contributions from allochthonous sources.

TI  - Ecosystem functioning approach applied to a large contaminated coastal site: the 
      study case of the Mar Piccolo of Taranto (Ionian Sea).
PG  - 12739-54
LID - 10.1007/s11356-015-4997-2 [doi]
AB  - Knowledge on ecosystem functioning can largely contribute to promote 
      ecosystem-based management and its application. The Mar Piccolo of Taranto is a 
      densely populated area at a high risk of environmental crisis. Here, planktonic 
      primary production (PP) and heterotrophic prokaryotic production (HPP) were 
      measured as proxies of functioning in three sampling sites located in two inlets 
      at different levels of industrial contamination, during three sampling surveys 
      (June 2013, February and April 2014). To have a better overall view and provide 
      some insights into the benthic-pelagic coupling, we integrated PP and HPP in the 
      water column with those in the sediments and then discussed this with the origin 
      of the organic matter pools based on analysis of stable isotopes. Heavy metals 
      and polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) were also analysed in the surface (1 cm) sediment 
      layer and related to the overall ecosystem functioning. Multidimensional scaling 
      (MDS) analysis, based on the main data, clearly separated the second inlet from 
      the first one, more severely impacted by anthropogenic activities. The stable 
      isotope mixing model suggested the prevalent terrestrial/riverine origin of the 
      particulate organic matter pools (mean 45.5 %) in all sampling periods, whereas 
      phytoplankton contributed up to 29 % in February. Planktonic PP and HPP rates 
      followed the same pattern over the entire study period and seemed to respond to 
      phytoplankton dynamics confirming this community as the main driver for the C 
      cycling in the water column. On the contrary, benthic PP rates were almost 
      negligible while HPP rates were lower or comparable to those in the water column 
      indicating that although the Mar Piccolo is very shallow, the water column is 
      much more productive than the surface sediments. The sediment resuspension is 
      likely responsible for a pulsed input of contaminants into the water column. 
      However, their interference with the proper functioning of the pelagic ecosystem 
      seems to be limited to the bottom layers.

AB  - Artificial structures are agents of change in marine ecosystems. They add novel 
      habitat for hard-substrate organisms and modify the surrounding environment. Most 
      research to date has focused on the communities living directly on artificial 
      structures, and more research is needed on the potential impacts these structures 
      have on nearby communities and the surrounding environment. We compared the 
      sedimentary habitat surrounding two types of artificial structures (pilings and 
      seawalls) to sediments adjacent to rocky reefs using a combination of traditional 
      sediment analyses, stable isotope analysis, and environmental DNA. Artificial and 
      natural shore sediments were best differentiated by sediment variables strongly 
      associated with flow speed. Pilings sediments had significantly finer grain size, 
      higher organic content, and generally lower C:N ratios than sediments adjacent to 
      the other habitat types, suggesting flow is reduced by pilings. Sedimentary 
      assemblages near pilings were also consistent with those predicted under low-flow 
      conditions, with elevated bacterial colonization and increased relative 
      abundances of small deposit feeders compared with other habitat types. 
      Additionally, lumbrinerid polychaetes in pilings sediments had reduced δ(15)N 
      values, suggesting different detrital resources and fewer trophic linkages 
      compared with lumbrinerids in other habitats. Woody detritus was greater adjacent 
      to seawalls than to natural rocky shores or pilings. Our findings suggest that 
      artificial structures have the potential to influence adjacent soft sediments 
      through changes to sediment properties that affect infaunal and microbial 
      communities, as well as trophic linkages for some consumers. We hypothesize that 
      this is due to a combination of altered flow, differing detrital subsidies, and 
      differing adjacent land-use among habitat types. Managers should consider the 
      potential for changed sediment properties and ecology when deciding where to 
      build different types of artificial structures. Further manipulative experiments 
      are needed to understand mechanisms of change and help manage the impacts of 
      artificial structures on the seafloor.

TI  - Mercury biomagnification in the food web of Lake Tanganyika (Tanzania, East 
      Africa).
PG  - 184-91
LID - 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2008.04.017 [doi]
AB  - Lake Tanganyika is a globally important lake with high endemic biodiversity. 
      Millions of people in the lake basin depend on several fish species for 
      consumption. Due to the importance of fish consumption as an exposure route of 
      mercury to humans, we sampled Lake Tanganyika in 2000 to assess total mercury 
      concentrations and biomagnification of total mercury through the food web. Stable 
      nitrogen and carbon isotope analyses of food web structure indicate a complex 
      food web with overlapping omnivory with some specialist fish species. Stable 
      nitrogen isotope analyses further confirm that mercury is biomagnifying through 
      the Tanganyika food web at rates similar to those seen in Lakes Malawi and 
      Victoria, the other two African Great Lakes. Most collected fish species and all 
      invertebrate species had mercury concentrations below 0.2 microg Hg/g wet weight. 
      However, several fish species, Ctenochromis horei (average 0.15 microg/g ww), 
      Neolamprologus boulengeri (0.2 microg/g ww) , Bathybates spp.spp. (0.21 microg/g 
      ww), Mastacembelus cunningtoni (0.22 microg/g ww) and Clarias theodorae (0.22 
      microg/g ww) approached or slightly exceeded the World Health Organization 
      (WHO)'s recommended guideline of 0.2 microg Hg/g for vulnerable populations with 
      high rates of fish consumption. Two individuals of the piscivorous fish species 
      Lates microlepis (0.54, 0.78 microg/g ww) and a Polypterus congicus (1.3 microg/g 
      ww) exceeded the international marketing limit value of 0.5 microg/g ww. Because 
      C. theodorae and L. microlepis are also important market fish species, there is a 
      need to monitor mercury concentrations in internationally marketed fish from Lake 
      Tanganikya to ensure that those fish do not present a risk to human consumers.

TI  - Polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorinated pesticides in birds from a 
      contaminated region in South China: association with trophic level, tissue 
      distribution and risk assessment.
PG  - 556-65
LID - 10.1007/s11356-010-0397-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Birds have been used successfully for biomonitoring of the levels and 
      effects of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the environments; however, 
      there is exceedingly little data on organochlorinated pesticide (OCPs) and 
      polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) residues in bird inhabiting in China. In the 
      present study, we detected the concentrations of PCBs, 
      dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites (DDTs) and 
      hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) in muscle, liver and kidney of birds that inhabit 
      in an e-waste recycling site. Associated with the stable isotope ratio (δ (15)N), 
      we investigated the effect of trophic level on the body burdens of persistent 
      contaminants in birds. The tissue distributions of contaminants in these birds 
      were examined, and a preliminary risk assessment was also conducted. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Specimens from eight bird species were collected from Qingyuan 
      County, Guangdong Province, South China. Pectoral muscle, liver and kidney 
      tissues were Soxhlet-extracted and finally dissolved in isooctane. Both PCBs and 
      OCPs were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The subsamples for 
      nitrogen stable isotope analysis were lyophilized, ground and analyzed by a flash 
      EA 112 series elemental analyzer interfaced with an isotope ration mass 
      spectrometer. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: PCBs exhibited the highest concentrations 
      among all target compounds, and a preliminary risk assessment suggested that 
      adverse effects might occur in some birds for its high level. Generally, the 
      concentrations of pollutants in liver and kidney were higher than those in 
      muscle, which was mainly driven by passive diffusion to the 'lipid-compartment'. 
      Significant differences in level of contaminants were obtained among species due 
      to the varieties in dietary composition and habitat. An increasing trend was 
      obtained between concentrations of PCBs and DDTs with trophic levels; however, 
      HCHs exhibited the same level among species. RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: 
      Because of the e-waste recycling activities, the study area has been heavily 
      polluted by PCBs. Studies on the species-specific hazard assessment associated 
      with exposure to PCBs are urgently needed in the study of birds in the area.

TI  - Giving-updensity and dietary shifts in the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus 
      leucopus.
PG  - 87-95
AB  - Dietary shifts are commonly exhibited by omnivorous consumers when foraging from 
      variable food resources. One advantage of dietary shifts for a consumer is the 
      ability to gain complementary resources from different foods. In addition, 
      dietary shifts often affect food-web dynamics. Despite the importance of dietary 
      shifts to organismal, community, and ecosystem ecology, empirical studies of the 
      ecological mechanisms that control dietary shifts are limited in scope. In this 
      study, we tested the effects of complementary resources on dietary shifts of an 
      omnivorous mammal, the white-footed mouse Peromyscus leucopus, in the context of 
      depletable food patches in the natural environment. We used two complementary 
      resources: seeds that provide a higher energy gain per unit handling time and 
      mealworms that provide a higher protein gain per unit handling time. Stable 
      isotopes of carbon and nitrogen (delta13C, delta15N) in mouse plasma were used to 
      quantify dietary shifts, and we determined giving-up density (GUD), the food 
      density at which a forager leaves a food patch (for an optimal forager, it should 
      correspond to the quitting harvest rate that balances net fitness gain with 
      various costs of foraging). The results showed that GUD increased most 
      significantly when a mixture of seeds and mealworms was added, compared to when 
      only seeds or mealworms were added. This suggests that, given a similar level of 
      food availability, a patch with a mixture of complementary foods is of higher 
      quality than a patch with only one type of food. Moreover, GUD measured with 
      seeds (GUDs) correlated positively with seed availability, and GUD measured with 
      mealworms (GUDmw) correlated positively with mealworm availability, indicating 
      that the marginal value of seeds or mealworms decreases with their relatively 
      availability in the environment. As GUDs increased, P. leucopus shifted their 
      diets toward higher trophic levels, and as GUDmw increased, P. leucopus shifted 
      their diets toward lower trophic levels, suggesting dietary shifts driven by food 
      complementarity. This study demonstrated that the combination of giving-up 
      density and stable-isotope analysis holds great potential for testing ecological 
      mechanisms underlying dietary shifts.

TI  - Simultaneous measurement of uptake and elimination of cadmium by caddisfly 
      (Trichoptera: Hydropsychidae) larvae using stable isotope tracers.
PG  - 1032-9
AB  - The use of stable isotopes coupled with inductively coupled plasma-mass 
      spectrometry provides a unique opportunity to investigate pathways of metals in 
      aquatic invertebrates. In this study, the simultaneous uptake and elimination of 
      cadmium (Cd) in stream-dwelling caddisfly (Trichoptera: Hydropsychidae) larvae 
      was measured in laboratory experiments with stable isotopes of Cd. In one 
      experiment, animals were exposed to low levels (0.5 microg/L) of 114Cd in 
      filtered river water and uptake was measured for 9 d, followed by 9 d during 
      which the larvae were exposed to either 114Cd, 113Cd, or filtered river water. In 
      a second experiment, the initial exposure concentration of 114Cd varied from 0.1 
      to 1.6 microg/L for 5 d, followed by 5 d during which the larvae were exposed to 
      the same respective levels of 113Cd. The purpose of the two experiments was to 
      test whether or not elimination of 114Cd from Hydropsyche larvae was the same in 
      the presence or absence of Cd in the water and also whether or not elimination 
      rates were dependent on exposure concentration. The results indicated that 
      elimination of Cd by Hydropsyche larvae (elimination rate constant approximately 
      0.21-0.24/d) in the presence of Cd in the water was the same as the depuration 
      when no metal was present. Furthermore, the elimination rate was independent of 
      exposure concentrations, ranging between 0.1 and 1.6 microg/L. Thus, the stable 
      isotope tracer technique enabled the simultaneous measurement of uptake and 
      elimination of Cd in hydropsychid larvae and may have the potential to facilitate 
      the labeling of various compartments (e.g., water, sediment, and food) in the 
      aquatic environment.

      (fracking) are increasing worldwide due to global energy demands. Research has 
      only recently begun to assess fracking impacts to surrounding environments, and 
      very little research is aimed at determining effects on aquatic biodiversity and 
      contaminant biomagnification. Twenty-seven remotely-located streams in 
      Pennsylvania's Marcellus Shale basin were sampled during June and July of 2012 
      and 2013. At each stream, stream physiochemical properties, trophic biodiversity, 
      and structure and mercury levels were assessed. We used δ15N, δ13C, and methyl 
      mercury to determine whether changes in methyl mercury biomagnification were 
      related to the fracking occurring within the streams' watersheds. While we 
      observed no difference in rates of biomagnificaion related to within-watershed 
      fracking activities, we did observe elevated methyl mercury concentrations that 
      were influenced by decreased stream pH, elevated dissolved stream water Hg 
      values, decreased macroinvertebrate Index for Biotic Integrity scores, and lower 
      Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera macroinvertebrate richness at stream 
      sites where fracking had occurred within their watershed. We documented the loss 
      of scrapers from streams with the highest well densities, and no fish or no fish 
      diversity at streams with documented frackwater fluid spills. Our results suggest 
      fracking has the potential to alter aquatic biodiversity and methyl mercury 
      concentrations at the base of food webs.

AB  - Many generalist populations are composed of specialized individuals that use a 
      narrow part of the population's niche. Ecological theories predict that 
      individual specialization and population trophic niche are determined by biotic 
      interactions and resource diversity emerging from environmental variations (i.e. 
      ecological opportunities). However, due to the paucity of empirical and 
      experimental demonstrations, the genuine importance of each of these drivers in 
      determining trophic niche attributes is not fully appreciated. The present study 
      aimed at determining the population level and individual responses of brown trout 
      (Salmo trutta) to variations in ecological opportunities (terrestrial prey 
      inputs) and autochthonous prey communities among 10 stream reaches along a 
      riparian condition gradient using individual longitudinal monitoring and stable 
      isotope analyses. Our results suggested that trophic niche diversity varied along 
      the environmental gradient, while individual trophic specialization was 
      indirectly driven by ecological opportunities through strengthened intraspecific 
      competition. Individual diet was repeatable over the study period, and the growth 
      rate of juvenile brown trout increased with their specialization for aquatic 
      predatory invertebrates. Our findings highlight the dual influences of 
      intraspecific competition and ecological opportunities on individual trophic 
      specialization and population trophic niche.

TI  - Source and trophic transfer of mercury in plankton from an ultraoligotrophic

PG  - 1184-94
LID - 10.1007/s10646-014-1260-4 [doi]
AB  - The incorporation and trophic transfer of total and methyl mercury (THg, MeHg) 
      were examined in three size classes of plankton (10-53, 53-200, and >200 μm size 
      range) and a small planktivorous fish, Galaxias maculatus, from the large 
      multi-branched Lake Nahuel Huapi (North Patagonia, Argentina). Three sites 
      representing a large range of lake benthic-pelagic structures (based on depth and 
      shoreline characteristics) and precipitation regimes were sampled. Nitrogen and 
      carbon stable isotopes (δ(15)N, δ(13)C) were analyzed to assess Hg 
      trophodynamics. Selenium concentrations were determined together with THg in 
      order to consider its potential effect on Hg trophodynamics. High THg 
      concentrations (0.1-255 µg g(-1) dry weight (DW)) were measured in plankton, 
      largely in inorganic form (MeHg: 3-29 ng g(-1) DW, 0.02-7% of THg, in the two 
      larger size classes). A trend of increasing THg concentrations, varying in two to 
      three orders of magnitude, with decreasing plankton size was associated with 
      precipitation measured prior to each sampling event. Passive adsorption of 
      dissolved Hg(2+) from wet deposition and runoff is considered to be the principal 
      Hg uptake mechanism at the base of the pelagic food web. Despite the initially 
      high THg uptake in the smaller plankton classes, the transfer to G. maculatus, 
      and consequently to the entire food web, is likely limited due to low proportion 
      of MeHg to THg in plankton. Furthermore, evidence of G. maculatus with benthic 
      feeding habits having higher impact on MeHg trophic transfer compared to the same 
      species with more pelagic (e.g., zooplankton) feeding habits, was observed. 
      Although there is a high THg uptake in plankton, limited amounts are incorporated 
      in the entire food web from the pelagic compartment.

TI  - Assimilation of oil-derived elements by oysters due to the Deepwater Horizon Oil 
      Spill.
PG  - 12787-95
LID - 10.1021/es302369h [doi]
AB  - During and after the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill (DWHOS), oysters (Crassostrea 
      virginica) were exposed to oil and susceptible to incidental consumption of 
      surface and subsurface oil materials. We determined the contribution of oil 
      materials from the DWHOS to diet of oysters by comparing carbon (C) and nitrogen 
      (N) stable isotope ratios in oyster shell to ratios in suspended particulate 
      matter (SPM) and in fresh and weathered oil. Average δ(13)C and δ(15)N values in 
      oyster shell (-21 ± 1‰ and 9-11‰, respectively) were consistent with consumption 
      of naturally available SPM as opposed to values in oil (-27 ± 0.2‰, 1.6 ± 0.4‰). 
      Stable isotope ratios in oyster adductor muscle were similar to shell for δ(15)N 
      but not δ(13)C, suggesting either a recent shift in diet composition or 
      differential assimilation of C between tissue types. We found no evidence of 
      assimilation of oil-derived C and N and, therefore, no evidence of an 
      oyster-based conduit to higher trophic levels. Trace elements in shell were 
      inconclusive to corroborate oil exposure. These findings are not an indication 
      that oysters were not exposed to oil; rather they imply oysters either did not 
      consume oil-derived materials or consumed too little to be detectable compared to 
      natural diet.

TI  - Incorporation of plant carbon into the soil animal food web of an arable system.
PG  - 235-45
AB  - We used stable isotopes to examine the incorporation of plant carbon into the 
      belowground food web of an agricultural system. Plots were established and 
      planted with maize (Zea mays) in a rye field (Secale cereale) near Göttingen 
      (northern Germany) in May 1999. In October 1999, April 2000, and October 2000, 
      meso- and macrofauna and maize and rye litter were collected in each plot and 
      analyzed for 13C and 15N content. 15N signatures suggested that the soil animal 
      species analyzed span three trophic levels with the trophic position of species 
      varying little in time. The species investigated formed a continuum from primary 
      to secondary decomposers to predators. On average, predator species differed from 
      primary and secondary decomposers by 3.9 sigma15N suggesting that they fed on a 
      mixed diet of both decomposer groups. The combined analysis of 13C and 15N 
      signatures allowed us to identify links between prey and consumer species. In 
      October 1999, shortly after maize residues had been incorporated into the plots, 
      maize-born carbon was present in each of the animal species investigated, 
      including top predators. The incorporation of maize carbon into the belowground 
      food web increased during the following 12 months but the concentration of 
      maize-born carbon never exceeded 50% in any of the species. Furthermore, the 
      ranks of the incorporation of maize-born carbon of the species changed little. 
      The results suggest that the belowground food web relies heavily on carbon 
      originating from plant residues from before the recent two growing seasons. In 
      most species the amount of maize-born carbon increased continuously; however, in 
      some species it decreased during winter, suggesting that these species switched 
      to a diet based more on C3 plants during winter, or predominantly metabolized 
      carbon incorporated during the last growing season. The study documents that the 
      combined analysis of 13C and 15N signatures in soil invertebrate species, after 
      replacement of C3 by C4 plants, is a powerful tool to better understand the 
      structure of the belowground food web and the flux of carbon through it.

TI  - Soil carbon dioxide partial pressure and dissolved inorganic carbonate chemistry 
      under elevated carbon dioxide and ozone.
PG  - 296-306
AB  - Global emissions of atmospheric CO(2) and tropospheric O(3) are rising and 
      expected to impact large areas of the Earth's forests. While CO(2) stimulates net 
      primary production, O(3) reduces photosynthesis, altering plant C allocation and 
      reducing ecosystem C storage. The effects of multiple air pollutants can alter 
      belowground C allocation, leading to changes in the partial pressure of CO(2) 
      (pCO(2)) in the soil , chemistry of dissolved inorganic carbonate (DIC) and the 
      rate of mineral weathering. As this system represents a linkage between the long- 
      and short-term C cycles and sequestration of atmospheric CO(2), changes in 
      atmospheric chemistry that affect net primary production may alter the fate of C 
      in these ecosystems. To date, little is known about the combined effects of 
      elevated CO(2) and O(3) on the inorganic C cycle in forest systems. Free air 
      CO(2) and O(3) enrichment (FACE) technology was used at the Aspen FACE project in 
      Rhinelander, Wisconsin to understand how elevated atmospheric CO(2) and O(3) 
      interact to alter pCO(2) and DIC concentrations in the soil. Ambient and elevated 
      CO(2) levels were 360+/-16 and 542+/-81 microl l(-1), respectively; ambient and 
      elevated O(3) levels were 33+/-14 and 49+/-24 nl l(-1), respectively. Measured 
      concentrations of soil CO(2) and calculated concentrations of DIC increased over 
      the growing season by 14 and 22%, respectively, under elevated atmospheric CO(2) 
      and were unaffected by elevated tropospheric O(3). The increased concentration of 
      DIC altered inorganic carbonate chemistry by increasing system total alkalinity 
      by 210%, likely due to enhanced chemical weathering. The study also demonstrated 
      the close coupling between the seasonal delta(13)C of soil pCO(2) and DIC, as a 
      mixing model showed that new atmospheric CO(2) accounted for approximately 90% of 
      the C leaving the system as DIC. This study illustrates the potential of using 
      stable isotopic techniques and FACE technology to examine long- and short-term 
      ecosystem C sequestration.

AB  - Understanding the fate of fecal pollution in the landscape is required for 
      microbial risk analysis. The aim of this study was to assess the patterns and 
      dynamics of beta-d-glucuronidase (GLUC), which has been suggested as a surrogate 
      for fecal pollution monitoring, in a stream draining an agricultural headwater 
      catchment. Automated enzymatic on-site measurements of stream water and sediments 
      were made over two years (2014-2016) to quantify the sources and pathways of GLUC 
      in a stream. The event water fraction of streamflow was estimated by stable 
      isotopes. Samples from field sediments on a hillslope, streambed sediment and 
      stream water were analyzed for GLUC and with a standard E. coli assay. The 
      results showed ten times higher GLUC and E. coli concentrations during the summer 
      than during the winter for all compartments (field and streambed sediments and 
      stream water). The E. coli concentrations in the streambed sediment were 
      approximately 100 times those of the field sediments. Of the total GLUC load in 
      the study period, 39% were transported during hydrological events (increased 
      streamflow due to rainfall or snowmelt); of these, 44% were transported when the 
      stream contained no recent rainwater. The results suggested that a large 
      proportion of the GLUC and E. coli in the stream water stemmed from resuspended 
      streambed sediments. Moreover, the results strongly indicated the existence of 
      remnant populations of GLUC-active organisms in the catchment.

AB  - Seasonal and ontogenetic shifts in the diet of Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus 
      were studied in a deep, ultra-oligotrophic lake in subarctic Finland from both 
      stomach contents and the stable carbon (delta(13)C) and nitrogen (delta(15)N) 
      isotope compositions of muscle and liver tissues. Both diet and isotope results 
      indicated that the S. alpinus population relied mainly on littoral benthic energy 
      sources. The strong littoral reliance appeared largely independent of season or 
      fish size, although the data lacked small (total length, L(T), <130 mm) and young 
      (<3 years) S. alpinus. Liver isotope values of intermediate-sized S. alpinus 
      (200-350 mm), however, suggested exploitation of the increase in the abundance of 
      pelagic zooplankton in the late open-water season. The results suggest that, in 
      general, a strong littoral reliance of fishes can be a feature in subarctic lakes 
      throughout the year. Due to its faster isotopic turnover rate and thus higher 
      resolution for temporal diet changes, liver could be more commonly used in 
      stable-isotope studies of fish trophic niche shifts instead of using only the 
      less responsive muscle tissue.

TI  - The importance of marine vs. human-induced subsidies in the maintenance of an

PG  - 1049-60

AB  - 1. Most studies addressing the causes of the recent increases and expansions of 
      mesopredators in many ecosystems have focused on the top-down, releasing effect 
      of extinctions of large apex predators. However, in the case of the northward 
      expansion of the red fox into the arctic tundra, a bottom-up effect of increased 
      resource availability has been proposed, an effect that can counteract prey 
      shortage in the low phase of the multi-annual rodent cycle. Resource subsidies 
      both with marine and with terrestrial origins could potentially be involved. 2. 
      During different phases of a multi-annual rodent cycle, we investigated the 
      seasonal dynamics and spatial pattern of resource use by red foxes across a coast 
      to inland low arctic tundra gradient, Varanger Peninsula, Norway. We employed two 
      complementary methods of diet analyses: stomach contents and stable isotope 
      analysis. 3. We found that inland red foxes primarily subsisted on reindeer 
      carrions during the low phase of a small rodent population cycle. Lemmings became 
      the most important food item towards the peak phase of the rodent cycle, despite 
      being less abundant than sympatric voles. Isotopic signatures of tissue from both 
      predator and prey also revealed that red foxes near the coast used marine-derived 
      subsidies in the winter, but these allochthonous resources did not spillover to 
      adult foxes living beyond 20-25 km from the coast. 4. Although more needs to be 
      learned about the link between increasing primary productivity due to climatic 
      warming and trophic dynamics in tundra ecosystems, we suggest that changes in 
      reindeer management through a bottom-up effect, at least regionally, may have 
      paved the way towards the establishment of a new mesopredator in the tundra 
      biome.

TI  - Source tracing of natural organic matter bound mercury in boreal forest runoff 
      with mercury stable isotopes.
PG  - 1235-1248
LID - 10.1039/c7em00245a [doi]
AB  - Terrestrial runoff represents a major source of mercury (Hg) to aquatic 
      ecosystems. In boreal forest catchments, such as the one in northern Sweden 
      studied here, mercury bound to natural organic matter (NOM) represents a large 
      fraction of mercury in the runoff. We present a method to measure Hg stable 
      isotope signatures of colloidal Hg, mainly complexed by high molecular weight or 
      colloidal natural organic matter (NOM) in natural waters based on pre-enrichment 
      by ultrafiltration, followed by freeze-drying and combustion. We report that Hg 
      associated with high molecular weight NOM in the boreal forest runoff has very 
      similar Hg isotope signatures as compared to the organic soil horizons of the 
      catchment area. The mass-independent fractionation (MIF) signatures (Δ(199)Hg and 
      Δ(200)Hg) measured in soils and runoff were in agreement with typical values 
      reported for atmospheric gaseous elemental mercury (Hg(0)) and distinctly 
      different from reported Hg isotope signatures in precipitation. We therefore 
      suggest that most Hg in the boreal terrestrial ecosystem originated from the 
      deposition of Hg(0) through foliar uptake rather than precipitation. Using a 
      mixing model we calculated the contribution of soil horizons to the Hg in the 
      runoff. At moderate to high flow runoff conditions, that prevailed during 
      sampling, the uppermost part of the organic horizon (Oe/He) contributed 50-70% of 
      the Hg in the runoff, while the underlying more humified organic Oa/Ha and the 
      mineral soil horizons displayed a lower mobility of Hg. The good agreement of the 
      Hg isotope results with other source tracing approaches using radiocarbon 
      signatures and Hg : C ratios provides additional support for the strong coupling 
      between Hg and NOM. The exploratory results from this study illustrate the 
      potential of Hg stable isotopes to trace the source of Hg from atmospheric 
      deposition through the terrestrial ecosystem to soil runoff, and provide a basis 
      for more in-depth studies investigating the mobility of Hg in terrestrial 
      ecosystems using Hg isotope signatures.

PG  - 9912-9917
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1702584114 [doi]
AB  - There is a pressing need to understand how ecosystems will respond to climate 
      change. To date, no long-term empirical studies have confirmed that fish 
      populations exhibit adaptive foraging behavior in response to temperature 
      variation and the potential implications this has on fitness. Here, we use an 
      unparalleled 11-y acoustic telemetry, stable isotope, and mark-recapture dataset 
      to test if a population of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), a cold-water 
      stenotherm, adjusted its use of habitat and energy sources in response to annual 
      variations in lake temperatures during the open-water season and how these 
      changes translated to the growth and condition of individual fish. We found that 
      climate influenced access to littoral regions in spring (data from telemetry), 
      which in turn influenced energy acquisition (data from isotopes), and growth 
      (mark-recapture data). In more stressful years, those with shorter springs and 
      longer summers, lake trout had reduced access to littoral habitat and assimilated 
      less littoral energy, resulting in reduced growth and condition. Annual variation 
      in prey abundance influenced lake trout foraging tactics (i.e., the balance of 
      the number and duration of forays) but not the overall time spent in littoral 
      regions. Lake trout greatly reduced their use of littoral habitat and occupied 
      deep pelagic waters during the summer. Together, our results provide clear 
      evidence that climate-mediated behavior can influence the dominant energy 
      pathways of top predators, with implications ranging from individual fitness to 
      food web stability.

AB  - Spatial and temporal variation can confound interpretations of relationships 
      within and between species in terms of diet composition, niche size, and trophic 
      position (TP). The cause of dietary variation within species is commonly an 
      ontogenetic niche shift, which is a key dynamic influencing community structure. 
      We quantified spatial and temporal variations in ringed seal (Pusa hispida) diet, 
      niche size, and TP during ontogeny across the Arctic-a rapidly changing 
      ecosystem. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis was performed on 558 liver 
      and 630 muscle samples from ringed seals and on likely prey species from five 
      locations ranging from the High to the Low Arctic. A modest ontogenetic diet 
      shift occurred, with adult ringed seals consuming more forage fish (approximately 
      80 versus 60 %) and having a higher TP than subadults, which generally decreased 
      with latitude. However, the degree of shift varied spatially, with adults in the 
      High Arctic presenting a more restricted niche size and consuming more Arctic cod 
      (Boreogadus saida) than subadults (87 versus 44 %) and adults at the lowest 
      latitude (29 %). The TPs of adult and subadult ringed seals generally decreased 
      with latitude (4.7-3.3), which was mainly driven by greater complexity in trophic 
      structure within the zooplankton communities. Adult isotopic niche size increased 
      over time, likely due to the recent circumpolar increases in subarctic forage 
      fish distribution and abundance. Given the spatial and temporal variability in 
      ringed seal foraging ecology, ringed seals exhibit dietary plasticity as a 
      species, suggesting adaptability in terms of their diet to climate change.

TI  - Trophic behaviour of juvenile reef fishes inhabiting interlinked 
      mangrove-seagrass habitats in offshore mangrove islets.
PG  - 256-73
LID - 10.1111/jfb.12715 [doi]
AB  - Stable isotope (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) and gut content analyses were used to 
      investigate size-related feeding habits of four reef fishes (the beaugregory 
      Stegastes leucostictus, the french grunt Haemulon flavolineatum, the schoolmaster 
      snapper Lutjanus apodus and the yellowtail snapper Ocyurus chrysurus) inhabiting 
      an offshore (non-estuarine) mangrove islet off Belize, Central America. 
      Comparisons of isotopic niche space and Schoener diet similarity index suggested 
      a low to moderate degree of niche overlap between fish size groups. The δ(13)C 
      gradient between mangrove and seagrass prey as well as results of Bayesian mixing 
      models revealed that sampled fishes relied mostly on seagrass prey items. Only 
      small and large juveniles of the carnivorous species L. apodus derived a part of 
      their diet from mangroves by targeting mangrove-associated Grapsidae crabs and 
      fish prey, respectively. Isotopic niche shifts were particularly obvious for 
      carnivorous fishes that ingested larger prey items (Xanthidae crabs and fishes) 
      during their ontogeny. The utilization of mangrove food resources is less than 
      expected and depends on the ecology and life history of the fish species 
      considered. This research highlights that mangrove-derived carbon contributed 
      relatively little to the diets of four fish taxa from an offshore mangrove islet.

AB  - The Mediterranean basin is one of the most invaded seas of the world. Invasive 
      species have affected coastal benthic communities inducing structural changes. 
      Since first reports, in the early 90s, Caulerpa cylindracea is considered one of 
      the most important invasive event in the Mediterranean Sea where it has invaded 
      large areas of soft bottoms, seagrass meadows and rocky shores. To assess effects 
      of C. cylindracea in rocky ecosystems, benthic food webs have been compared 
      between invaded and non-invaded coastal conditions through stable isotopes 
      analyses. In addition, the convex hull area of the two types of conditions has 
      been calculated as a proxy for the total extent of trophic diversity within each 
      food web. Results have shown that the trophic niche width is at least 1.4 times 
      wider in invaded conditions than in non-invaded conditions. In addition, this 
      study gives further evidence of similar feeding analogies between the invasive 
      herbivore fish, Siganus luridus and native herbivore fish Sparisoma cretense as 
      both are feeding at the same isotopic level. This investigation provides with new 
      scientific data to assess bionvasions in invaded and non-invaded conditions at 
      assemblage level in coastal systems.

AB  - The development of farming was a catalyst for the evolution of the human diet 
      from the varied subsistence practices of hunter-gatherers to the more globalised 
      food economy we depend upon today. Although there has been considerable research 
      into the dietary changes associated with the initial spread of farming, less 
      attention has been given to how dietary choices continued to develop during 
      subsequent millennia. A paleogenomic time transect for 5 millennia of human 
      occupation in the Great Hungarian Plain spanning from the advent of the Neolithic 
      to the Iron Age, showed major genomic turnovers. Here we assess where these 
      genetic turnovers are associated with corresponding dietary shifts, by examining 
      the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of 52 individuals. Results provide 
      evidence that early Neolithic individuals, which were genetically characterised 
      as Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, relied on wild resources to a greater extent than 
      those whose genomic attributes were of typical Neolithic European farmers. Other 
      Neolithic individuals and those from the Copper Age to Bronze Age periods relied 
      mostly on terrestrial C3 plant resources. We also report a carbon isotopic ratio 
      typical of C4 plants, which may indicate millet consumption in the Late Bronze 
      Age, despite suggestions of the crop's earlier arrival in Europe during the 
      Neolithic.

PG  - e17970

LID - e17970
AB  - Trophic shifts of generalist consumers can have broad food-web and biodiversity 
      consequences through altered trophic flows and vertical diversity. Previous 
      studies have used trophic shifts as indicators of food-web responses to 
      perturbations, such as species invasion, and spatial or temporal subsidies. 
      Resource pulses, as a form of temporal subsidies, have been found to be quite 
      common among various ecosystems, affecting organisms at multiple trophic levels. 
      Although diet switching of generalist consumers in response to resource pulses is 
      well documented, few studies have examined if the switch involves trophic shifts, 
      and if so, the directions and magnitudes of the shifts. In this study, we used 
      stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes with a Bayesian multi-source mixing model to 
      estimate proportional contributions of three trophic groups (i.e. producer, 
      consumer, and fungus-detritivore) to the diets of the White-footed mouse 
      (Peromyscus leucopus) receiving an artificial seed pulse or a naturally-occurring 
      cicadas pulse. Our results demonstrated that resource pulses can drive trophic 
      shifts in the mice. Specifically, the producer contribution to the mouse diets 
      was increased by 32% with the seed pulse at both sites examined. The consumer 
      contribution to the mouse diets was also increased by 29% with the cicadas pulse 
      in one of the two grids examined. However, the pattern was reversed in the second 
      grid, with a 13% decrease in the consumer contribution with the cicadas pulse. 
      These findings suggest that generalist consumers may play different functional 
      roles in food webs under perturbations of resource pulses. This study provides 
      one of the few highly quantitative descriptions on dietary and trophic shifts of 
      a key consumer in forest food webs, which may help future studies to form 
      specific predictions on changes in trophic interactions following resource 
      pulses.

      tuna from western Indian and south-eastern Atlantic Oceans: Trophic influence and 
      potential as tracers of populations.

AB  - Albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga) is a highly commercial fish species harvested in 
      the world's Oceans. Identifying the potential links between populations is one of 
      the key tools that can improve the current management across fisheries areas. In 
      addition to characterising populations' contamination state, chemical compounds 
      can help refine foraging areas, individual flows and populations' structure, 
      especially when combined with other intrinsic biogeochemical (trophic) markers 
      such as carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes. This study investigated the 
      bioaccumulation of seven selected trace metals - chromium, nickel, copper (Cu), 
      zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg) and lead - in the muscle of 443 albacore 
      tunas, collected over two seasons and/or years in the western Indian Ocean (WIO: 
      Reunion Island and Seychelles) and in the south-eastern Atlantic Ocean (SEAO: 
      South Africa). The main factor that explained metal concentration variability was 
      the geographic origin of fish, rather than the size and the sex of individuals, 
      or the season/year of sampling. The elements Cu, Zn, Cd and Hg indicated a 
      segregation of the geographic groups most clearly. For similar sized-individuals, 
      tunas from SEAO had significantly higher concentrations in Cu, Zn and Cd, but 
      lower Hg concentrations than those from WIO. Information inferred from the 
      analysis of trophic markers (δ(13)C, δ(15)N) and selected persistent organic 
      pollutants, as well as information on stomach contents, corroborated the 
      geographical differences obtained by trace metals. It also highlighted the 
      influence of trophic ecology on metal bioaccumulation. Finally, this study 
      evidenced the potential of metals and chemical contaminants in general as 
      tracers, by segregating groups of individuals using different food webs or 
      habitats, to better understand spatial connectivity at the population scale. 
      Limited flows of individuals between the SEAO and the WIO are suggested. Albacore 
      as predatory fish also provided some information on environmental and food web 
      chemical contamination in the different study areas.

TI  - Utilization of invasive tamarisk by salt marsh consumers.
PG  - 259-72
LID - 10.1007/s00442-008-1144-5 [doi]
AB  - Plant invasions of coastal wetlands are rapidly changing the structure and 
      function of these systems globally. Alteration of litter dynamics represents one 
      of the fundamental impacts of an invasive plant on salt marsh ecosystems. 
      Tamarisk species (Tamarix spp.), which extensively invade terrestrial and 
      riparian habitats, have been demonstrated to enter food webs in these ecosystems. 
      However, the trophic impacts of the relatively new invasion of tamarisk into 
      marine ecosystem have not been assessed. We evaluated the trophic consequences of 
      invasion by tamarisk for detrital food chains in the Tijuana River National 
      Estuarine Research Reserve salt marsh using litter dynamics techniques and stable 
      isotope enrichment experiments. The observations of a short residence time for 
      tamarisk combined with relatively low C:N values indicate that tamarisk is a 
      relatively available and labile food source. With an isotopic (15N) enrichment of 
      tamarisk, we demonstrated that numerous macroinvertebrate taxonomic and trophic 
      groups, both within and on the sediment, utilized 15N derived from labeled 
      tamarisk detritus. Infaunal invertebrate species that took up no or limited 15N 
      from labeled tamarisk (A. californica, enchytraeid oligochaetes, coleoptera 
      larvae) occurred in lower abundance in the tamarisk-invaded environment. In 
      contrast, species that utilized significant 15N from the labeled tamarisk, such 
      as psychodid insects, an exotic amphipod, and an oniscid isopod, either did not 
      change or occurred in higher abundance. Our research supports the hypothesis that 
      invasive species can alter the trophic structure of an environment through 
      addition of detritus and can also potentially impact higher trophic levels by 
      shifting dominance within the invertebrate community to species not widely 
      consumed.

AB  - Some Arctic food web structures are being affected by climate change with 
      potential consequences for long-term trends of environmental contaminants. We 
      examined the effects of changes in trophic position of an Arctic-breeding 
      seabird, the thick-billed murre (Uria lomvia), on declining rates of six major 
      organochlorines (hexachlorobenzene, heptachlor epoxide, oxychlordane, dieldrin, 
      p,p'-DDE and Σ69PCB) at two breeding colonies in the Canadian Arctic, one in 
      northern Hudson Bay and one in the high Arctic. As a result of a change in diet, 
      murres breeding in Hudson Bay lowered their trophic position during 1993-2013. 
      After adjusting for the change in trophic position using egg δ(15)N values, the 
      rates of decline in concentrations of all six organochlorines were reduced in the 
      Hudson Bay murre eggs. In contrast, the murres at the high Arctic colony 
      experienced an increase in trophic position which resulted in an increase in the 
      rates of decline for all adjusted concentrations, except for p,p'-DDE and Σ69PCB 
      which remained relatively unchanged. This suggests that the dramatic reduction in 
      emissions of these compounds during the 1970s/1980s had a greater influence on 
      the time trends than changes in diet at the high Arctic colony. Linkages between 
      climate change and food web processes are complex, and may have serious 
      consequences for our understanding of contaminant temporal trends. Valid trends 
      can be deduced only when these factors have been taken into account.

TI  - Newly discovered methoxylated polybrominated diphenoxybenzenes have been 
      contaminants in the Great Lakes herring gull eggs for thirty years.
PG  - 9456-63
LID - 10.1021/es3018978 [doi]
AB  - We recently reported the discovery and identification of novel methoxylated 
      polybrominated diphenoxybenzenes (MeO-PBDPBs) in herring gulls eggs from the 
      Laurentian Great Lakes of North America. We presently investigated the temporal 
      changes (1982-2010) in MeO-PBDPB concentrations and congener patterns, as well as 
      chemical tracers of diet (ratios of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes), in egg 
      pool homogenates from five selected colony sites across the Great Lakes. Egg pool 
      homogenates from the Channel-Shelter (C-S) Island (Lake Huron) contained 
      ∑MeO-PBDPB concentrations orders of magnitude greater than those from other 
      colonies, suggesting potential point contamination sources nearby. In the C-S 
      Island egg pools, concentrations increased from the initial study year (31 ng/g 
      wet weight) and peaked around the late 1990s, followed by a general decline until 
      2010. Over the period, concentrations generally increased in eggs from Fighting 
      Island (Lake Erie), Toronto Harbour (Lake Ontario) and Big Sister Island (Lake 
      Michigan) colonies, whereas the levels in Agawa Rock (Lake Superior) declined. 
      Although other factors likely exist, changes over time in the carbon and nitrogen 
      isotope tracers reflected a shift of the gull diet from aquatic to more 
      terrestrial origins, and suggested this diet shift partially accounted for the 
      temporal changes of ∑MeO-PBDPB levels in eggs from most colonies. The ratio of 
      Br(6)- to Br(5)-MeO-PBDPB congeners generally decreased over time in the colonies 
      at Channel-Shelter Island, Fighting Island and Agawa Rock. This suggested that 
      Br(5)- versus Br(6)-MeO-PBDPB congeners and/or possibly their nonmethoxylated and 
      higher brominated precursors may have been more abundant in diets of terrestrial 
      origin. Notably, these MeO-PBDPB congeners are not "emerging" brominated 
      substances, but rather "recently discovered" contaminants since, as of 2011, 
      ∑MeO-PBDPB concentrations have been constantly in the range of 30-100 ng/g ww for 
      at least the last 30 years.

      pools contribute to existent MMHg levels. In this study, ambient concentrations 
      of total Hg (THg) and MMHg as well as rates of methylation and demethylation were 
      measured simultaneously in sediments with and without salt-marsh plant 
      vegetation, which were collected in Guadiana and Tagus estuaries, Portugal. 
      Concurrent processes of Hg methylation and MMHg demethylation were directly 
      monitored and compared by spiking sediments cores with stable isotope tracers of 
      (199)Hg(2+) and CH(3)(201)Hg(+) followed by gas chromatographic separation and 
      isotope-specific detection using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. 
      Compared to the Guadiana estuary, where concentrations were comparatively low, 
      THg and MMHg levels varied between vegetated and non-vegetated sediments 
      collected at the Rosário site (ROS) of the Tagus estuary. Methylation (K(M)) and 
      demethylation rates (K(D)) were also different between estuaries being dependent 
      on the presence of vegetation. In addition, the type of macrophyte species 
      influenced K(M) and K(D) values. In fact, the highest K(M) value was found in 
      Sarcocornia fruticosa vegetated sediments at the Castro Marim site in Guadiana 
      (CM, 0.160 day(-1)) and the lowest K(M) was observed in non-vegetated sediments 
      at the Alcochete site in Tagus (ALC, 0.009 day(-1)). K(D) varied by a factor of 
      three among sites with highest rates of demethylation observed in non-vegetated 
      sediments in Guadiana (12 ± 1.3 day(-1), corresponding to a half-life of 
      1.4 ± 0.2 h). This study clearly shows that the presence of vegetation in 
      sediments favors the formation of MMHg. Moreover, this effect might be site 
      specific and further studies are needed to confirm the findings reported here.

AB  - Drylands typically have strong seasonal variation in rainfall and primary 
      productivity. This study examines the effects of seasonal change in grass-derived 
      resource availability on the base of the food chain of a mammalian predator. 
      Seasonal changes in live grass cover were measured in two vegetation types at the 
      Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge in central New Mexico, USA. Non-invasive 
      genetic sampling of scat was used to identify individuals in the local coyote 
      (Canis latrans) population. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of hair 
      removed from scats of 45 different coyotes was used to assess seasonal variation 
      in the diet of mammalian coyote prey that came from C4 grasses. Live grass cover 
      increased from the spring to the summer and fall; contribution of C4 grasses to 
      the diet of mammalian coyote prey increased from the summer to the fall and was 
      higher in grassland areas. There were significant differences in the seasonal 
      patterns in the prey diet between grassland and shrubland areas.

      approach.
PG  - 286-297
LID - 10.1080/10256016.2016.1254209 [doi]
AB  - Plant-soil interactions are recognized to play a crucial role in the ecosystem 
      response to climate change. We developed a facility to disentangle the complex 
      interactions behind the plant-soil C feedback mechanisms. The MICE 
      ('Multi-Isotope labelling in a Controlled Environment') facility consists of two 
      climate chambers with independent control of the atmospheric conditions (light, 
      CO(2), temperature, humidity) and the soil environment (temperature, moisture). 
      Each chamber holds 15 plant-soil systems with hermetical separation of the shared 
      above ground (shoots) from the individual belowground compartments (roots, 
      rhizosphere, soil). Stable isotopes (e.g. (13)C, (15)N, (2)H, (18)O) can be added 
      to either compartment and traced within the whole system. The soil CO(2) efflux 
      rate is monitored, and plant material, leached soil water and gas samples are 
      taken frequently. The facility is a powerful tool to improve our mechanistic 
      understanding of plant-soil interactions that drive the C cycle feedback to 
      climate change.

PG  - 2014-2020
LID - 10.13287/j.1001-9332.202106.027 [doi]
AB  - Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios (δ(13)C and δ(15)N, respectively) of 
      multiple tissues with different turnover rates can provide trophic information at 
      different timescales, and thus play an important role in tracing the changes of 
      feeding, habitat utilization and trophic niche of consumers. The δ(13)C and 
      δ(15)N contents of muscle, liver and blood of blue sharks (Prionace glauca), 
      longfin mako sharks (Isurus paucus), crocodile sharks (Pseudocarcharias 
      kamoharai) and shortfin mako sharks (I. oxyrinchus) from tropical Atlantic were 
      measured, and the trophic niche was evalua-ted. The results showed that I. 
      oxyrinchus, P. kamoharai, and P. glauca had similar δ(15)N values, higher than 
      that of I. paucus. Feeding segregation was found between P. glauca and other 
      species, showing unique trophic niche. The largest trophic niche width was 
      observed in I. oxyrinchus, indicating the high diversity of prey and (or) feeding 
      habitats. High trophic niche overlap was found in P. kamoharai and I. oxyrinchus, 
      implying their potential competition for resources. There was no correlation 
      between the differences among tissues in the δ(13)C or δ(15)N values and the body 
      size of I. oxyrinchus, P. kamoharai and P. glauca, indicating no recent diet 
      shifts for those species. I. paucus showed significant correlation between δ(15)N 
      differences in liver, blood and muscle with the shark fork length, indicating its 
      short-term diet shift. The similarity of δ(13)C and δ(15)N values and the higher 
      metabolic rates of liver and blood were found in all four shark species, implying 
      the similar incorporation rates of both tissues, which were considered as the 
      short-term indicator of diet.

TI  - Possible shift in macaque trophic level following a century of biodiversity loss 
      in Singapore.
PG  - 217-20
LID - 10.1007/s10329-011-0251-9 [doi]
AB  - Biodiversity loss in tropical forests is a major problem in conservation biology, 
      and nowhere is this more dire than in Southeast Asia. Deforestation and the 
      associated loss of species may trigger shifts in habitat and feeding preferences 
      of persisting species. In this study, I compared the habitat use and diet of 
      long-tailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis) populations in Singapore from two time 
      periods: museum specimens originally collected between 1893 and 1944, and living 
      macaques sampled in 2009. I collected hair and used stable carbon and nitrogen 
      isotope analysis to identify temporal changes in dietary source and trophic 
      position, respectively. δ(13)C ratios were virtually identical, suggesting that 
      macaques foraged in similar habitats during both time periods. However, δ(15)N 
      ratios decreased considerably over time, suggesting that macaques today feed at a 
      lower trophic level than previously. This decline in trophic level may be because 
      of the disappearance or decline of other species that compete with macaques for 
      fruit. This study highlights the effect of biodiversity loss on persisting 
      species in degraded habitats of Southeast Asia, and improves our understanding of 
      how species will adapt to further human-driven changes in tropical forest 
      habitats.

TI  - Mercury bioaccumulation and trophic transfer in sympatric snapper species from 
      the Gulf of Mexico.
PG  - 2100-10
AB  - Consumption of marine fish is a major route of toxic methyl mercury (MeHg) 
      exposure to ocean apex predators and human populations. Here we explore the 
      influence of trophic structure on total mercury (Hg) accumulation in red snapper 
      (RS, Lutjanus campechanus) and gray snapper (GS, Lutjanus griseus) from the 
      coastal Louisiana region of the Gulf of Mexico, west of the Mississippi River. 
      The objectives of this investigation were to: (1) determine the effectiveness of 
      the use of offshore recreational fishing charter boats and marinas as sources of 
      fish samples and (2) compare species differences in Hg bioaccumulation, trophic 
      position, and carbon sources. Our data show that length-normalized Hg 
      concentrations (> or = 97% as MeHg in tissue of both species) were 230% greater 
      in GS in comparison to RS collected from the same general area. Stable C and N 
      isotope signatures (delta15N and delta13C) indicate that GS occupy a slightly 
      higher trophic position (approximately 30% of one trophic position higher) on the 
      Gulf food web in comparison to RS and that GS appear to incorporate higher 
      trophic positioned prey, continually and at smaller sizes. Mercury was strongly 
      correlated with combined delta15N and delta13C in pooled species data, arguing 
      that most of the substantial difference in Hg bioaccumulation between RS and GS 
      can be explained by modest differences in their trophic position and, to a lesser 
      degree, carbon sources, which had low variation and high overlap among species. 
      These observations demonstrate that even minor to moderate differences in trophic 
      position and food habits in sympatric species can create relatively large 
      differences in bioaccumulation regimes and underscores the importance of 
      quantitative characterization of trophic structure in marine MeHg bioaccumulation 
      studies.

AB  - This study quantified concentrations of mercury (Hg) and its trophic transfer 
      along the fish community in the Indrawati River, Nepal. Stable isotope ratios of 
      nitrogen (δ(15)N) and carbon (δ(13)C), complemented by stomach contents data were 
      used to assess the food web structure and trophic transfer of Hg in 54 fishes; 43 
      Shizothorax richardsonii and 11 Barilius spp. [B. bendelisis (1), B. vagra (3) 
      and B. barila (7)]. Sixty-one muscle samples (including six replicates) were used 
      for the analysis of total mercury (THg) and stable isotopes. Mean THg 
      concentrations in B. spp. and the more common species S. richardsonii was 
      observed to be 218.23 (ng/g, ww) and 90.82 (ng/g, ww), respectively. THg versus 
      total length in both S. richardsonii and B. spp. showed a decreasing tendency 
      with an increase in age. Regression of logTHg versus δ(15)N among the fish 
      species showed a significant positive correlation only in S. richardsonii 
      indicating biomagnification along the trophic level in this species.

TI  - Tracing Mississippi River influences in estuarine food webs of coastal Louisiana.
PG  - 659-72
AB  - The Breton Sound estuary in southern Louisiana receives large amounts of 
      Mississippi River water via a controlled diversion structure at the upstream end 
      of the estuary. We used stable isotopes to trace spatial and seasonal responses 
      of the downstream food web to winter and spring introductions of river water. 
      Analysis of delta13C, delta15N, and delta34S in the common local consumers such 
      as grass shrimp (Palaemonetes sp.), barnacles (Balanus sp.), and small 
      plankton-feeding fish (bay anchovies, Anchoa mitchilli) showed that the diversion 
      was associated with two of the five major source regimes that were supporting 
      food webs: a river regime near the diversion and a river-influenced productive 
      marsh regime farther away from the diversion. Mixing models identified a third 
      river-influenced source regime at the marine end of the estuary where major 
      natural discharge from the Bird's Foot Delta wraps around into estuarine waters. 
      The remaining two source regimes represented typical estuarine conditions: local 
      freshwater sources especially from precipitation and a brackish source regime 
      representing higher salinity marine influences. Overall, the Mississippi River 
      diversion accounted for 75% of food web support in the upper estuary and 25% in 
      the middle estuary, with influence strongest along known flow pathways and 
      closest to the diversion. Isotopes also traced seasonal changes in river 
      contributions, and indicated increased plant community productivity along the 
      major flow path of diversion water. In the Breton Sound estuary, bottom-up 
      forcing of food webs is strongly linked to river introductions and discharge, 
      occurring in spatial and temporal patterns predictable from known river input 
      regimes and known hydrologic circulation patterns.

TI  - Mercury methylation and demethylation by periphyton biofilms and their host in a 
      fluvial wetland of the St. Lawrence River (QC, Canada).

AB  - Wetlands in large rivers are important sites of production of the neurotoxin 
      methylmercury (MeHg), and the periphyton growing on wetland macrophytes are 
      increasingly recognized as key players in this production and transfer in food 
      webs. Information is lacking about mercury methylation (Km) and demethylation 
      (Kd) rates in periphytic biofilms from the Northern Hemisphere, as well as about 
      the drivers of net MeHg production, hampering ecosystem modeling of Hg cycling. 
      Mercury methylation and demethylation rates were measured in periphytic biofilms 
      growing on submerged plants in a shallow fluvial lake located in a temperate cold 
      region (St. Lawrence River, Quebec, Canada). Incubations were performed in situ 
      within macrophyte beds using low-level spikes of (199)HgO and Me(200)Hg stable 
      isotopes as tracers. A direct relationship was observed between Km (0.002 to 
      0.137 d(-1)) and [MeHg] in periphyton. A similar relationship was found between 
      Kd (0.096 to 0.334 d(-1)) and [inorganic Hg]. Periphyton of Lake St. Pierre 
      reached high levels of net MeHg production that were two orders of magnitude 
      higher than those found in local sediment. This production varied through the 
      plant growing season and was mainly driven by environmental variables such as 
      depth of growth, available light, dissolved oxygen, temperature, plant community 
      structure, and productivity of the habitat.

      modifies size-abundance scaling in stream food webs.
PG  - 1771-1780
LID - 10.1111/ele.13147 [doi]
AB  - Body mass-abundance (M-N) allometries provide a key measure of community 
      structure, and deviations from scaling predictions could reveal how 
      cross-ecosystem subsidies alter food webs. For 31 streams across the UK, we 
      tested the hypothesis that linear log-log M-N scaling is shallower than that 
      predicted by allometric scaling theory when top predators have access to 
      allochthonous prey. These streams all contained a common and widespread top 
      predator (brown trout) that regularly feeds on terrestrial prey and, as 
      hypothesised, deviations from predicted scaling increased with its dominance of 
      the fish assemblage. Our study identifies a key beneficiary of cross-ecosystem 
      subsidies at the top of stream food webs and elucidates how these inputs can 
      reshape the size-structure of these 'open' systems.

TI  - The catabolic pathways of in situ rhizosphere PAH degraders and the main factors 
      driving PAH rhizoremediation in oil-contaminated soil.
PG  - 7042-7055
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.15790 [doi]
AB  - Rhizoremediation is a potential technique for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 
      (PAH) remediation; however, the catabolic pathways of in situ rhizosphere PAH 
      degraders and the main factors driving PAH rhizoremediation remain unclear. To 
      address these issues, stable-isotope-probing coupled with metagenomics and 
      molecular ecological network analyses were first used to investigate the 
      phenanthrene rhizoremediation by three different prairie grasses in this study. 
      All rhizospheres exhibited a significant increase in phenanthrene removal and 
      markedly modified the diversity of phenanthrene degraders by increasing their 
      populations and interactions with other microbes. Of all the active phenanthrene 
      degraders, Marinobacter and Enterobacteriaceae dominated in the bare and 
      switchgrass rhizosphere respectively; Achromobacter was markedly enriched in 
      ryegrass and tall fescue rhizospheres. Metagenomes of (13) C-DNA illustrated 
      several complete pathways of phenanthrene degradation for each rhizosphere, which 
      clearly explained their unique rhizoremediation mechanisms. Additionally, 
      propanoate and inositol phosphate of carbohydrates were identified as the 
      dominant factors that drove PAH rhizoremediation by strengthening the ecological 
      networks of soil microbial communities. This was verified by the results of 
      rhizospheric and non-rhizospheric treatments supplemented with these two 
      substances, further confirming their key roles in PAH removal and in situ PAH

PG  - 603-14

AB  - Stable C isotope ratio (δ(13)C) values of chironomid remains (head capsules; HC) 
      were used to infer changes in benthic C sources over the last 150 years for two 
      French sub-Alpine lakes. The HCs were retrieved from a series of sediment cores 
      from different depths. The HC δ(13)C values started to decrease with the onset of 
      eutrophication. The HC δ(13)C temporal patterns varied among depths, which 
      revealed spatial differences in the contribution of methanotrophic bacteria to 
      the benthic secondary production. The estimates of the methane (CH4)-derived C 
      contribution to chironomid biomass ranged from a few percent prior to the 1930s 
      to up to 30 % in recent times. The chironomid fluxes increased concomitantly with 
      changes in HC δ(13)C values before a drastic decrease due to the development of 
      hypoxic conditions. The hypoxia reinforced the implication for CH4-derived C 
      transfer to chironomid production. In Lake Annecy, the HC δ(13)C values were 
      negatively correlated to total organic C (TOC) content in the sediment (Corg), 
      whereas no relationship was found in Lake Bourget. In Lake Bourget, chironomid 
      abundances reached their maximum with TOC contents between 1 and 1.5 % Corg, 
      which could constitute a threshold for change in chironomid abundance and 
      consequently for the integration of CH4-derived C into the lake food webs. Our 
      results indicated that the CH4-derived C contribution to the benthic food webs 
      occurred at different depths in these two large, deep lakes (deep waters and 
      sublittoral zone), and that the trophic transfer of this C was promoted in 
      sublittoral zones where O2 gradients were dynamic.

AB  - We developed a geochemical atlas of the Colorado River in Grand Canyon and in its 
      tributary, the Little Colorado River, and used it to identify provenance and 
      habitat use by Federally Endangered humpback chub, Gila cypha. Carbon stable 
      isotope ratios (δ(13)C) discriminate best between the two rivers, but fine scale 
      analysis in otoliths requires rare, expensive instrumentation. We therefore 
      correlated other tracers (SrSr, Ba, and Se in ratio to Ca) to δ(13)C that are 
      easier to quantify in otoliths with other microchemical techniques. Although the 
      Little Colorado River's water chemistry varies with major storm events, at base 
      flow or near base flow (conditions occurring 84% of the time in our study) its 
      chemistry differs sufficiently from the mainstem to discriminate one from the 
      other. Additionally, when fish egress from the natal Little Colorado River to the 
      mainstem, they encounter cold water which causes the otolith daily growth 
      increments to decrease in size markedly. Combining otolith growth increment 
      analysis and microchemistry permitted estimation of size and age at first egress; 
      size at first birthday was also estimated. Emigrants < 1 year old averaged 51.2 ± 
      4.4 (SE) days and 35.5 ± 3.6 mm at egress; older fish that had recruited to the 
      population averaged 100 ± 7.8 days old and 51.0 ± 2.2 mm at egress, suggesting 
      that larger, older emigrants recruit better. Back-calculated size at age 1 was 
      unimodal and large (78.2 ± 3.3 mm) in Little Colorado caught fish but was 
      bimodally distributed in Colorado mainstem caught fish (49.9 ± 3.6 and 79 ± 4.9 
      mm) suggesting that humpback chub can also rear in the mainstem. The study 
      demonstrates the coupled usage of the two rivers by this fish and highlights the 
      need to consider both rivers when making management decisions for humpback chub 
      recovery.

AB  - Understanding the fate of persistent organic chemicals in the environment is 
      fundamental information for the successful protection of ecosystems and humans. A 
      common dilemma in risk assessment is that monitoring data reveals contaminant 
      concentrations in wildlife, while the source concentrations, route of uptake and 
      acceptable source concentrations remain unsolved. To overcome this problem, 
      different models have been developed in order to obtain more precise risk 
      estimates for the food webs. However, there is still an urgent need for studies 
      combining modelled and measured data in order to verify the functionality of the 
      models. Studies utilising field-collected data covering entire food webs are 
      particularly scarce. This study aims to contribute to tackling this problem by 
      determining the validity of two bioaccumulation models, BIOv1.22 and AQUAWEBv1.2, 
      for application to a multispecies aquatic food web. A small boreal lake, Lake 
      Kernaalanjärvi, in Finland was investigated for its food web structure and 
      concentrations of PCBs in all trophic levels. Trophic magnification factors 
      (TMFs) were used to measure the bioaccumulation potential of PCBs, and the 
      site-specific environmental parameters were used to compare predicted and 
      observed concentrations. Site-specific concentrations in sediment pore water did 
      not affect the modelling endpoints, but accurate site-specific measurements of 
      freely dissolved concentrations in water turned out to be crucial for obtaining 
      realistic model-predicted concentrations in biota. Numerous parameters and 
      snapshot values affected the model performances, bringing uncertainty into the 
      process and results, but overall, the models worked well for a small boreal lake 
      ecosystem. We suggest that these models can be optimised for different ecosystems 
      and can be useful tools for estimating the bioaccumulation and environmental fate 
      of PCBs.

PG  - 4236-42
LID - 10.1021/jf803760s [doi]
AB  - Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values of whole yolk, delipidized yolk, 
      albumen, and egg membrane were analyzed from 18 different brands of chicken eggs 
      laid under caged, barn, free range, and organic farming regimes. In general, free 
      range and organic egg components showed enrichment of (15)N values up to 4‰ 
      relative to caged and barn laid eggs, suggesting a higher animal protein 
      (trophic) contribution to the chicken's diet than pure plant-based foods and/or 
      that the feed was organically manufactured. One sample of free range and two 
      samples of organic eggs had δ(15)N values within the range of caged or barn laid 
      eggs, suggesting either that these eggs were mislabeled (the hens were raised 
      under "battery" or "barn" conditions, and not permitted to forage outside) or 
      that there was insufficient animal protein gained by foraging to shift the δ(15)N 
      values of their primary food source. δ(13)C values of potential food sources are 
      discussed with respect to dietary intake and contribution to the isotopic 
      signature of the eggs to determine mixing of C(3) and C(4) diets, although they 
      did not elucidate laying regimen. The study finds that stable nitrogen isotope 
      analysis of egg components is potentially a useful technique to unravel dietary 
      differences between caged or barn hens and free range hens (both conventional and 
      organic) and could be further developed as an authentication tool in the egg 
      industry.

TI  - Contrasting PCB bioaccumulation patterns among Lake Huron lake trout reflect 
      basin-specific ecology.
PG  - 65-73
LID - 10.1002/etc.3179 [doi]
AB  - This study collected multiple age classes of lake trout from Lake Huron's Main 
      Basin, Georgian Bay, and North Channel regions to compare and contrast top 
      predator polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) bioaccumulation patterns in separate 
      compartments of the same ecosystem. Sum PCB concentrations were highest for Main 
      Basin (260 ± 24.9 ng g(-1) wet wt) fish, followed by Georgian Bay 
      (74.6 ± 16.2 ng g(-1) ) and North Channel (42.0 ± 3.3 ng g(-1)) fish. 
      Discriminant functions analysis of lake trout PCB profiles and stable carbon 
      (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) isotope values clearly distinguished fish by 
      location, indicating high degrees of basin fidelity throughout their lifetimes in 
      addition to highly contrasting PCB bioaccumulation profiles. These unique 
      profiles were not attributable to significant differences in lake trout lipid 
      contents (p = 0.856) or trophic position (δ(15)N; p = 0.334), with rainbow smelt 
      representing the primary prey across the basins. Furthermore, significant 
      differences were observed among the basins for the relationships between PCB 
      biomagnification factors and hydrophobicity. An empirical model for predicting 
      PCB biomagnification in Lake Huron lake trout indicated that basin-specific 
      population growth rates and prey abundances were significant for explaining these 
      contrasting patterns of PCB bioaccumulation. The results of the present study are 
      fundamental for understanding the role of ecology in legacy persistent organic 
      pollutant (POP) bioaccumulation. Specifically, ecosystem characteristics such as 
      prey abundances, foraging ecology, and ultimately consumer growth can regulate 
      the variability of legacy POP bioaccumulation as observed within and among a wide 
      range of freshwater ecosystems.

TI  - Food web pathway determines how selenium affects aquatic ecosystems: a San 
      Francisco Bay case study.
PG  - 4519-26
AB  - Chemical contaminants disrupt ecosystems, but specific effects may be 
      under-appreciated when poorly known processes such as uptake mechanisms, uptake 
      via diet, food preferences, and food web dynamics are influential. Here we show 
      that a combination of food web structure and the physiology of trace element 
      accumulation explain why some species in San Francisco Bay are threatened by a 
      relatively low level of selenium contamination and some are not. Bivalves and 
      crustacean zooplankton form the base of two dominant food webs in estuaries. The 
      dominant bivalve Potamocorbula amurensis has a 10-fold slower rate constant of 
      loss for selenium than do common crustaceans such as copepods and the mysid 
      Neomysis mercedis (rate constant of loss, ke = 0.025, 0.155, and 0.25 d(-1), 
      respectively). The result is much higher selenium concentrations in the bivalve 
      than in the crustaceans. Stable isotope analyses show that this difference is 
      propagated up the respective food webs in San Francisco Bay. Several predators of 
      bivalves have tissue concentrations of selenium that exceed thresholds thought to 
      be associated with teratogenesis or reproductive failure (liver Se >15 microg 
      g(-1) dry weight). Deformities typical of selenium-induced teratogenesis were 
      observed in one of these species. Concentrations of selenium in tissues of 
      predators of zooplankton are less than the thresholds. Basic physiological and 
      ecological processes can drive wide differences in exposure and effects among 
      species, but such processes are rarely considered in traditional evaluations of 
      contaminant impacts.

TI  - Broad-scale trophic shift in the pelagic North Pacific revealed by an oceanic 
      seabird.

LID - 20162436
AB  - Human-induced ecological change in the open oceans appears to be accelerating. 
      Fisheries, climate change and elevated nutrient inputs are variously blamed, at 
      least in part, for altering oceanic ecosystems. Yet it is challenging to assess 
      the extent of anthropogenic change in the open oceans, where historical records 
      of ecological conditions are sparse, and the geographical scale is immense. We 
      developed millennial-scale amino acid nitrogen isotope records preserved in 
      ancient animal remains to understand changes in food web structure and nutrient 
      regimes in the oceanic realm of the North Pacific Ocean (NPO). Our 
      millennial-scale isotope records of amino acids in bone collagen in a 
      wide-ranging oceanic seabird, the Hawaiian petrel (Pterodroma sandwichensis), 
      showed that trophic level declined over time. The amino acid records do not 
      support a broad-scale increase in nitrogen fixation in the North Pacific 
      subtropical gyre, rejecting an earlier interpretation based on bulk and amino 
      acid specific δ(15)N chronologies for Hawaiian deep-sea corals and bulk δ(15)N 
      chronologies for the Hawaiian petrel. Rather, our work suggests that the food web 
      structure in the NPO has shifted at a broad geographical scale, a phenomenon 
      potentially related to industrial fishing.

TI  - Mercury trophic transfer in a eutrophic lake: the importance of habitat-specific 
      foraging.
PG  - A196-212
AB  - Mercury (Hg) trophic transfer and bioaccumulation in fish from a mine-impacted, 
      eutrophic lake were examined in relation to foraging habitat, trophic position, 
      and size. Diet analysis indicated that there were clear ontogenetic shifts in 
      foraging habitats and trophic position. Pelagic diet decreased and benthic diet 
      increased with increasing fish length in bluegill, black crappie, inland 
      silverside, and largemouth bass, whereas there was no shift for prickly sculpin 
      or threadfin shad. Stable carbon isotope values (delta13C) were inversely related 
      to the proportion of pelagic prey items in the diet, but there was no clear 
      relationship with benthic foraging. There were distinct differences between 
      pelagic and benthic prey basal delta13C values, with a range of approximately -28 
      per thousand in pelagic zooplankton to approximately -20 per thousand in benthic 
      caddisflies. Profundal prey such as chironomid larvae had intermediate delta13C 
      values of approximately -24 per thousand, reflecting the influence of pelagic 
      detrital subsidies and suppressing the propagation of the benthic carbon isotope 
      signal up the food chain. Fish total mercury (TotHg) concentrations varied with 
      habitat-specific foraging, trophic position, and size; however, the relationships 
      differed among species and ages. When controlling for the effects of species, 
      length, and trophic position, TotHg and delta13C were positively correlated, 
      indicating that Hg trophic transfer is linked to benthic foraging. When examined 
      on a species-specific basis, TotHg was positively correlated with delta13C only 
      for bluegill, largemouth bass, and threadfin shad. However, diet-based multiple 
      regression analyses suggested that TotHg also increased with benthic foraging for 
      inland silverside and black crappie. In both species, benthic prey items were 
      dominated by chironomid larvae, explaining the discrepancy with delta13C. These 
      results illustrate the importance of foraging habitat to Hg bioaccumulation and 
      indicate that pelagic carbon can strongly subsidize the basal energy sources of 
      benthic organisms.

AB  - We conducted a large-scale investigation of methylmercury (MeHg) in a total of 
      628 marine wild fish covering 46 different species collected from the South China 
      Sea between 2008 and 2009. Biological and ecological characteristics such as size 
      (length and wet weight), feeding habit, habitat, and stable isotope (δ(15)N) were 
      examined to explain MeHg bioaccumulation in marine fish and their geographical 
      distribution. MeHg levels in the muscle tissues of the 628 individuals ranged 
      from 0.010 to 1.811 μg/g dry wt. Log10MeHg concentration was significantly 
      related to their length and wet weight. Feeding habit and habitat were the 
      primary factors influencing MeHg bioaccumulation. Demersal fish were more likely 
      to be contaminated with MeHg than the epipelagic and mesopelagic varieties. 
      Linear relationships were obtained between Log10(MeHg) and δ(15)N only for one 
      location, indicating that biomagnification was site-specific. Results from this 
      study suggest that dietary preference and trophic structure were the main factors 
      affecting MeHg bioaccumulation in marine fish from the South China Sea.

TI  - Spatial and temporal trends of mercury concentrations in young-of-the-year 
      spottail shiners (Notropis hudsonius) in the St. Lawrence River at Cornwall, ON.
PG  - 473-81
AB  - The St. Lawrence River at Cornwall, Ontario is an "Area of Concern" because of 
      mercury (Hg) biomagnification from bottom sediments. To assess the spatial and 
      temporal distribution of Hg in the food web, young-of-the-year (YOY) spottail 
      shiners (Notropis hudsonius) were collected in August 2005 from five sites along 
      the Cornwall waterfront within a Hg-contaminated zone and two reference zones. 
      The results were compared to analyses made between 1979 and 2000 by the Ontario 
      Ministry of the Environment. Total Hg concentrations in spottail shiners from the 
      contaminated zone were significantly higher than in reference zones, confirming 
      previous observations. Within the contaminated zone, there were significant 
      differences in Hg concentrations among three sites spaced about 500 m apart, 
      consistent with a high degree of site fidelity of YOY fish and suggesting a 
      possible internal source of Hg. Hg concentrations in spottail shiners are 
      decreasing regionally, although year-to-year variability was high, particularly 
      in the contaminated zone. Stable isotope analyses of spottail shiners did not 
      reveal any differences in nitrogen isotope composition among zones that would 
      indicate differences in food-web structure and Hg biomagnification. However, 
      carbon sources at an upstream reference zone were not the same as within the Area 
      of Concern. Differences in carbon isotope composition at two sites within the 
      contaminated zone corresponded to differences in Hg concentrations, consistent 
      with a unique internal source of Hg. The variation in Hg contamination of YOY 
      spottail shiners over fine spatial and temporal scales provide important insights 
      about the potential release of Hg from contaminated sediments and the role of 
      climate in regional trends. Sessile YOY fish provide a precise indicator for 
      demonstrating these differences and for assessing their cause.

TI  - Contrasting energy pathways at the community level as a consequence of regime 
      shifts.

AB  - Ecological regime shifts typically result in abrupt changes in ecosystem 
      structure through several trophic levels, which leads to rapid ecosystem 
      reconfiguration between regimes. An interesting aspect of the impact of regime 
      shift is that alternative regimes may induce distinct shifts in energy pathways; 
      these have been less tested than structural changes. This paper addresses this by 
      using stable isotopes to establish the energy pathways in fish communities. We 
      specifically focus on the impact of regime shift on changes of the energy 
      pathways, and how the magnitude and direction of these changes affect the local 
      community. We found that energy pathways significantly varied among the 
      planktivorous, benthivorous, and piscivorous trophic guilds as a result of the 
      alternative regimes. The regime shift from a clear to a turbid state altered the 
      food web towards planktonic energy pathways and truncated food chain length, 
      which is indicative of less ecological efficiency. This was confirmed by the 
      adaptive foraging strategies of prevalent omnivores in the current communities. 
      These structural and functional characteristics of trophic interactions might not 
      facilitate classic trophic cascading effects in such a turbid regime and suppress 
      the system's response to environmental changes, e.g., nutrient loading, and 
      restoration efforts in turbid to clear water regime shifts.

TI  - Effects of river otter activity on terrestrial plants in trophically altered 
      Yellowstone Lake.
PG  - 1040-52
AB  - Animals that deposit aquatically derived nutrients on terrestrial landscapes link 
      food webs and affect a variety of in situ processes. This phenomenon, however, is 
      poorly documented in freshwater habitats, especially where species introductions 
      have drastically changed an ecosystem's trophic structure. In this study, we used 
      stable isotopes to document water-to-land nutrient transport by river otters 
      (Lontra canadensis) around Yellowstone Lake, an ecosystem recently altered by 
      nonnative species invasions. We then investigated the effects of otter 
      fertilization on plant growth and prevalence at latrine (scent-marking) sites and 
      evaluated how the recent changes to the lake's food web could influence these 
      plant responses. Values of delta15N were higher on latrines compared to 
      non-latrine sites in five of seven sample plant taxa. Additionally, latrine 
      grasses had higher percentage N than those from non-latrines. Foliar delta15N 
      positively related to fecal deposition rate for some plants, indicating that 
      increased otter scent-marking led to a rise in these N values. Logistic 
      regression models indicated that otters selected for well-shaded latrines with 
      access to foraging. Atypical latrines, misclassified as non-latrines by the 
      regression models, had values of delta15N similar to correctly classified 
      latrines, suggesting that site effects alone cannot explain elevated N values at 
      otter latrine sites. No difference in plant diversity or percent cover of 
      N-fixing taxa occurred between latrine and nonlatrine sites, though specific 
      genera did differ between site types. Measurements of shoot lengths indicated 
      increased growth of some latrine currants (Ribes sp.). In Yellowstone Lake, a 
      twofold reduction in otter numbers could result in an even greater decline in 
      nutrient deposition at latrines, as otters may become less social in a system 
      with decreased prey availability. Our results highlight the role of animals in 
      linking aquatic and terrestrial habitats in inland freshwater systems and suggest 
      that ongoing changes in the trophic structure of Yellowstone Lake could have 
      unexpected ramifications well beyond the lake itself.

TI  - Controlling for anthropogenically induced atmospheric variation in stable carbon 
      isotope studies.
PG  - 148-56
AB  - Increased use of stable isotope analysis to examine food-web dynamics, migration, 
      transfer of nutrients, and behavior will likely result in expansion of stable 
      isotope studies investigating human-induced global changes. Recent elevation of 
      atmospheric CO2 concentration, related primarily to fossil fuel combustion, has 
      reduced atmospheric CO2 delta13C (13C/12C), and this change in isotopic baseline 
      has, in turn, reduced plant and animal tissue delta13C of terrestrial and aquatic 
      organisms. Such depletion in CO2 delta13C and its effects on tissue delta13C may 
      introduce bias into delta13C investigations, and if this variation is not 
      controlled, may confound interpretation of results obtained from tissue samples 
      collected over a temporal span. To control for this source of variation, we used 
      a high-precision record of atmospheric CO2 delta13C from ice cores and direct 
      atmospheric measurements to model modern change in CO2 delta13C. From this model, 
      we estimated a correction factor that controls for atmospheric change; this 
      correction reduces bias associated with changes in atmospheric isotopic baseline 
      and facilitates comparison of tissue delta13C collected over multiple years. To 
      exemplify the importance of accounting for atmospheric CO2 delta13C depletion, we 
      applied the correction to a dataset of collagen delta13C obtained from mountain 
      lion (Puma concolor) bone samples collected in California between 1893 and 1995. 
      Before correction, in three of four ecoregions collagen delta13C decreased 
      significantly concurrent with depletion of atmospheric CO2 delta13C (n > or = 32, 
      P < or = 0.01). Application of the correction to collagen delta13C data removed 
      trends from regions demonstrating significant declines, and measurement error 
      associated with the correction did not add substantial variation to adjusted 
      estimates. Controlling for long-term atmospheric variation and correcting tissue 
      samples for changes in isotopic baseline facilitate analysis of samples that span 
      a large temporal range.

AB  - To assess the potential for nutritional exploitation of caged-fish-derived waste 
      through the use of extractive co-cultured species in a pilot system for an 
      integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA), we compared their C and N stable 
      isotope ratios with those of uncultured macroinvertebrates in and around the 
      system. Black rockfish were co-cultured with sea cucumber, oyster, and two 
      macroalgae as extractive species. Isotope signatures of the co-cultured sea 
      cucumber at the IMTA site differed from those at the control site, indicating 
      their assimilation of aquaculture wastes. In contrast, δ(13)C and δ(15)N of 
      individual taxa of the cultured oyster and uncultured invertebrates were 
      consistent between sites, suggesting a minor contribution of the aquaculture 
      waste to benthic and pelagic food chains in and around the IMTA system. These 
      results provide evidence of the suitability of using sea cucumber as an 
      extractive species to reduce the impact of a monoculture system on the ambient 
      environment.

AB  - Stable isotopic N, C, and S in food webs of 8 mangrove estuaries on the Pacific 
      coast of Panama were measured to 1) determine whether the degree of deforestation 
      of tropical forests on the contributing watersheds was detectable within the 
      estuarine food web, and 2) define external sources of the food webs within the 
      mangrove estuaries. Even though terrestrial rain forest cover on the contributing 
      watersheds differed between 23 and 92%, the effect of deforestation was not 
      detectable on stable isotopic values in food webs present at the mouth of the 
      receiving estuaries. We used stable isotopic measures to identify producers or 
      organic sources that supported the estuarine food web. N isotopic values of 
      consumers spanned a broad range, from about 2.7 to 12.3‰. Mean δ(15)N of primary 
      producers and organic matter varied from 3.3 for macroalgae to 4.7‰ for suspended 
      particulate matter and large particulate matter. The δ(13)C consumer data varied 
      between -26 and -9‰, but isotopic values of the major apparent producers or 
      organic matter sampled could not account for this range variability. The 
      structure of the food web was clarified when we added literature isotopic values 
      of microphytobenthos and coralline algae, suggesting that these, or other 
      producers with similar isotopic signature, may be part of the food webs.

      nitrogen availability.
PG  - 727-740
LID - 10.1038/ismej.2016.147 [doi]
AB  - Denitrification removes ecologically available nitrogen (N) from the biosphere 
      and influences both the pace and magnitude of global climate change. 
      Disagreements exist over the degree to which this microbial process influences 
      N-availability patterns across Earth's ecosystems. We combine natural stable 
      isotope methods with qPCR to investigate how denitrifier gene abundance is 
      related to variations in nitrate (NO(3)(-)) pool sizes across diverse terrestrial 
      biomes and conditions. We analyze NO(3)(-) isotope composition ((15)N/(14)N, 
      (18)O/(16)O) and denitrifier gene nirS in 52 soil samples from different 
      California ecosystems, spanning desert, chaparral, oak-woodland/savanna and 
      forest. δ(15)N-NO(3)(-) correlates positively with δ(18)O-NO(3)(-) (P⩽0.03) and 
      nirS abundance (P=0.00002) across sites, revealing the widespread importance of 
      isotopic discrimination by soil denitrifiers. Furthermore, NO(3)(-) 
      concentrations correlate negatively to nirS (P=0.002) and δ(15)N-NO(3)(-) 
      (P=0.003) across sites. We also observe these spatial relationships in short-term 
      (7-day), in situ soil-incubation experiments; NO(3)(-)-depletion strongly 
      corresponds with increased nirS, nirS/16 rRNA, and enrichment of heavy NO(3)(-) 
      isotopes over time. Overall, these findings suggest that microbial 
      denitrification can consume plant-available NO(3)(-) to low levels at multiple 
      time scales, contributing to N-limitation patterns across sites, particularly in 
      moist, carbon-rich soils. Furthermore, our study provides a new approach for 
      understanding the relationships between microbial gene abundance and terrestrial 
      ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Whole-lake experiments reveal the fate of terrestrial particulate organic carbon 
      in benthic food webs of shallow lakes.
PG  - 1496-505
AB  - Lake ecosystems are strongly linked to their terrestrial surroundings by material 
      and energy fluxes across ecosystem boundaries. However, the contribution of 
      terrestrial particulate organic carbon (tPOC) from annual leaf fall to lake food 
      webs has not yet been adequately traced and quantified. In this study, we 
      conducted whole-lake experiments to trace artificially added tPOC through the 
      food webs of two shallow lakes of similar eutrophic status, but featuring 
      alternative stable regimes (macrophyte rich vs. phytoplankton dominated). Lakes 
      were divided with a curtain, and maize (Zea mays) leaves were added, as an 
      isotopically distinct tPOC source, into one half of each lake. To estimate the 
      balance between autochthonous carbon fixation and allochthonous carbon input, 
      primary production and tPOC and tDOC (terrestrial dissolved organic carbon) 
      influx were calculated for the treatment sides. We measured the stable isotope 
      ratios of carbon (delta13C) of about 800 samples from all trophic consumer levels 
      and compared them between lake sides, lakes, and three seasons. Leaf litter bag 
      experiments showed that added maize leaves were processed at rates similar to 
      those observed for leaves from shoreline plants, supporting the suitability of 
      maize leaves as a tracer. The lake-wide carbon influx estimates confirmed that 
      autochthonous carbon fixation by primary production was the dominant carbon 
      source for consumers in the lakes. Nevertheless, carbon isotope values of benthic 
      macroinvertebrates were significantly higher with maize additions compared to the 
      reference side of each lake. Carbon isotope values of omnivorous and piscivorous 
      fish were significantly affected by maize additions only in the 
      macrophyte-dominated lake and delta13C of zooplankton and planktivorous fish 
      remained unaffected in both lakes. In summary, our results experimentally 
      demonstrate that tPOC in form of autumnal litterfall is rapidly processed during 
      the subsequent months in the food web of shallow lakes and is channeled to 
      secondary and tertiary consumers predominantly via the benthic pathways. A more 
      intense processing of tPOC seems to be connected to a higher structural 
      complexity in littoral zones, and hence may differ between shallow lakes of 
      alternative stable states.

AB  - Understanding the effects of dredging in estuaries is a hard task due to the 
      difficulty of implementing an adequate environmental diagnosis, as a consequence 
      of the salinity gradient and anthropogenic disturbances. To assess the effects of 
      maintenance dredging work on the Guadalquivir estuary (southwestern Spain), we 
      used a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) approach to determine both direct and 
      indirect effects in two salinity ranges. No effects were found on water and 
      sediment physicochemical characteristics. The small impacts on dredged areas were 
      followed by a rapid recovery of opportunistic species. The poor status of the 
      benthos does not permit the detection of significant effects on macrofaunal 
      community structure. The use of stable isotopes analysis to determine impacts on 
      food web structure showed that changes over time seem to be explained by natural 
      temporal variation rather than the dredging works. This paper emphasises the need 
      to define proper management and conservation plans to improve the status of the 
      benthic communities of the Guadalquivir estuary.

      Argyrosomus regius.
PG  - 10-30
LID - 10.1111/jfb.12241 [doi]
AB  - The performance of juvenile Argyrosomus regius released off the coast of Mallorca 
      Island (Balearic Islands, Spain) was assessed by comparing the body condition, 
      stable isotope signature and stomach contents of aquaculture-produced A. regius 
      that had been released, fished and returned by fishermen after spending from a 
      few days to >1 year at liberty with A. regius reared under controlled conditions 
      on two contrasting diets (well-fed and unfed). During the first 40 days of the 
      experiment, the condition index (K(R)) of the returned A. regius and the unfed A. 
      regius followed the same decreasing trend. Thereafter, the K(R) values of the 
      returned A. regius were significantly higher than those of the unfed A. regius 
      but never reached the values of well-fed A. regius. The δ¹³C signal of the 
      returned A. regius clearly increased (in comparison with the well-fed A. regius) 
      after they had spent a few months at liberty. The temporal pattern depicted by 
      the stable isotopes and the most likely prey composition inferred from this 
      pattern strongly suggest a shift in diet. The stomach contents of the returned A. 
      regius that had spent <100 days at liberty consisted almost exclusively of 
      decapods. The diet of the few returned A. regius that had spent >100 days at 
      liberty consisted entirely of fishes. Wild A. regius from the remaining fishery 
      on the Spanish coast exhibited the same ontogenetic diet shift from invertebrates 
      to fishes, but at a smaller size threshold. Overall, the results demonstrated 
      that culture-reared A. regius experience adverse conditions during the first days 
      after release into the wild but that at least some A. regius are able to adapt to 
      the natural environment after a few months at liberty.

LID - 10.1021/acs.est.5b01893 [doi]
AB  - Heavily contaminated sediments are a serious concern for ecosystem quality, 
      especially in coastal areas, where vulnerability is high due to intense 
      anthropogenic pressure. Surface sediments (54 stations), 50 cm interface cores 
      (five specific stations), river particles, coal and bulk Pb plate from past 
      French Navy activities, seawater and mussels were collected in Toulon Bay (NW 
      Mediterranean Sea). Lead content and Pb stable isotope composition have evidenced 
      the direct impact of sediment pollution stock on both the water column quality 
      and the living organisms, through the specific Pb isotopic signature in these 
      considered compartments. The history of pollution events including past and 
      present contaminant dispersion in Toulon Bay were also demonstrated by historical 
      records of Pb content and Pb isotope ratios in sediment profiles. The sediment 
      resuspension events, as simulated by batch experiments, could be a major factor 
      contributing to the high Pb mobility in the considered ecosystem. A survey of Pb 
      concentrations in surface seawater at 40 stations has revealed poor seawater 
      quality, affecting both the dissolved fraction and suspended particles and points 
      to marina/harbors as additional diffuse sources of dissolved Pb.

      impacts in the southern Barents Sea.
PG  - 193-206
LID - 10.1016/j.marpolbul.2009.02.022 [doi]
AB  - Identifying patterns and drivers of natural variability in populations is 
      necessary to gauge potential effects of climatic change and the expected 
      increases in commercial activities in the Arctic on communities and ecosystems. 
      We analyzed growth rates and shell geochemistry of the circumpolar Greenland 
      smooth cockle, Serripes groenlandicus, from the southern Barents Sea over almost 
      70 years between 1882 and 1968. The datasets were calibrated via 
      annually-deposited growth lines, and growth, stable isotope (delta(18)O, 
      delta(13)C), and trace elemental (Mg, Sr, Ba, Mn) patterns were linked to 
      environmental variations on weekly to decadal scales. Standardized growth indices 
      revealed an oscillatory growth pattern with a multi-year periodicity, which was 
      inversely related to the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAO), and positively 
      related to local river discharge. Up to 60% of the annual variability in Ba/Ca 
      could be explained by variations in river discharge at the site closest to the 
      rivers, but the relationship disappeared at a more distant location. Patterns of 
      delta(18)O, delta(13)C, and Sr/Ca together provide evidence that bivalve growth 
      ceases at elevated temperatures during the fall and recommences at the coldest 
      temperatures in the early spring, with the implication that food, rather than 
      temperature, is the primary driver of bivalve growth. The multi-proxy approach of 
      combining the annually integrated information from the growth results and higher 
      resolution geochemical results yielded a robust interpretation of biophysical 
      coupling in the region over temporal and spatial scales. We thus demonstrate that 
      sclerochronological proxies can be useful retrospective analytical tools for 
      establishing a baseline of ecosystem variability in assessing potential combined 
      impacts of climatic change and increasing commercial activities on Arctic 
      communities.

TI  - Tracing the sources of water using stable isotopes: first results along the 
      Mangalore-Udupi region, south-west coast of India.
PG  - 2769-76
LID - 10.1002/rcm.5104 [doi]
AB  - The Mangalore and Udupi region on the south-west coast of India is characterized 
      by small west-flowing rivers (150-250 km in length) originating in the Western 
      Ghats (up to 1940 meters above sea level (m asl)) and joining the Arabian Sea. 
      The area experiences a humid tropical climate with frequent, high-intensity 
      rainfall (4000 mm annual average). Nevertheless, there is a shortage of water 
      during the peak dry season immediately before the onset of monsoon because of a 
      rapid fall in the groundwater level. From the humid high-altitude forests to the 
      intense agriculture in the coastal area, there is an urgent need to understand 
      the movement of water between evapotranspiration, rainfall, river systems and the 
      groundwater compartments in order to achieve better water resource management. 
      Demographic pressure on the area with over half a million inhabitants and 
      industrial activity strongly influence this fragile ecosystem. The coastal area 
      is characterized by shallow open wells, which are particularly sensitive to 
      pollution and eutrophication. Stable water isotopes ((18)O and deuterium) were 
      used for the first time in this region to determine the isotopic characteristics 
      of the different waters. There is a clear seasonal difference in the isotopic 
      ratios and d-excess values between the summer and winter monsoon periods, with a 
      predominance of lighter isotopes in the latter period. No significant variations 
      in isotopic ratios were observed in relation to altitude because of the possible 
      role of mist formation at high altitude. Greater d-excess values were observed in 
      the west-flowing streams than in rivers flowing east on account of the moist 
      westerly oceanic winds and water vapour recycling.

AB  - The interactions among diet, ecology, physiology, and biochemistry affect N and C 
      stable isotope signatures in animal tissues. Here, we examined if ecological 
      segregation among animals in relation to sex and age existed by analyzing the 
      signatures of δ(15)N and δ(13)C in the muscle of Western Mediterranean striped 
      dolphins. Moreover, we used a Bayesian mixing model to study diet composition and 
      investigated potential dietary changes over the last two decades in this 
      population. For this, we compared isotope signatures in samples of stranded 
      dolphins obtained during two epizootic events occurring in 1990 and 2007-2008. 
      Mean δ(13)C values for females and males were not significantly different, but 
      age-related variation indicated δ(13)C enrichment in both sexes, suggesting that 
      females and males most likely fed in the same general areas, increasing their 
      consumption of benthic prey with age. Enrichment of δ(15)N was only observed in 
      females, suggesting a preference for larger or higher trophic level prey than 
      males, which could reflect different nutritional requirements. δ(13)C values 
      showed no temporal variation, although the mean δ(15)N signature decreased from 
      1990 to 2007-2008, which could indicate a dietary shift in the striped dolphin 
      over the last two decades. The results of SIAR indicated that in 1990, hake and 
      sardine together contributed to 60% on the diet of immature striped dolphins, and 
      close to 90% for mature striped dolphins. Conversely, the diet of both groups in 
      2007-2008 was more diverse, as hake and sardine contributed to less than 40% of 
      the entire diet. These results suggest a dietary change that was possibly related 
      to changes in food availability, which is consistent with the depletion of 
      sardine stocks by fishing.

TI  - Ontogenetic patterns in bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) feeding ecology and the 
      effect on mercury biomagnification.
PG  - 1447-58
LID - 10.1002/etc.516 [doi]
AB  - In this study, bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix; age 0-7, n = 632) and their prey 
      (forage fish, macroinvertebrates, zooplankton; n = 2,005) were collected from the 
      Narragansett Bay estuary (RI, USA), and total Hg concentration was measured in 
      white muscle and whole-body tissues, respectively. Bluefish Hg concentrations 
      were analyzed relative to fish length, prey Hg content, and ontogenetic shifts in 
      habitat use and foraging ecology, the latter assessed using stomach content 
      analysis (n = 711) and stable nitrogen (δ(15)N) and carbon (δ(13)C) isotope 
      measurements (n = 360). Diet and δ(13)C analysis showed that age 0 bluefish 
      consumed both benthic and pelagic prey (silversides, sand shrimp, planktonic 
      crustaceans; δ(13)C = - 16.52‰), whereas age 1 + bluefish fed almost exclusively 
      on pelagic forage fish (Atlantic menhaden, herring; δ(13)C = - 17.33‰). Bluefish 
      total Hg concentrations were significantly correlated with length (mean 
      Hg = 0.041 and 0.254 ppm wet wt for age 0 and age 1 + bluefish, respectively). 
      Furthermore, Hg biomagnification rates were maximal during bluefish early life 
      stages and decelerated over time, resulting in relatively high Hg concentrations 
      in age 0 fish. Rapid Hg accumulation in age 0 bluefish is attributed to these 
      individuals occupying a comparable trophic level to age 1 + bluefish 
      (δ(15)N = 15.58 and 16.09‰; trophic level = 3.55 and 3.71 for age 0 and age 1 + 
      bluefish, respectively), as well as juveniles having greater standardized 
      consumption rates of Hg-contaminated prey. Finally, bluefish larger than 30 cm 
      total length consistently had Hg levels above the U.S. Environmental Protection 
      Agency criterion of 0.3 ppm. As such, frequent consumption of bluefish could pose 
      a human health risk, and preferentially consuming smaller bluefish may be an 
      inadequate strategy for minimizing human dietary exposure to Hg.

TI  - Trophic overlap between fish and riparian spiders: potential impacts of an 
      invasive fish on terrestrial consumers.
PG  - 1745-52
LID - 10.1002/ece3.1893 [doi]
AB  - Studies on resource sharing and partitioning generally consider species that 
      occur in the same habitat. However, subsidies between linked habitats, such as 
      streams and riparian zones, create potential for competition between populations 
      which never directly interact. Evidence suggests that the abundance of riparian 
      consumers declines after fish invasion and a subsequent increase in resource 
      sharing of emerging insects. However, diet overlap has not been investigated. 
      Here, we examine the trophic niche of native fish, invasive fish, and native 
      spiders in South Africa using stable isotope analysis. We compared spider 
      abundance and diet at upstream fishless and downstream fish sites and quantified 
      niche overlap with invasive and native fish. Spider abundance was consistently 
      higher at upstream fishless sites compared with paired downstream fish sites, 
      suggesting that the fish reduced aquatic resource availability to riparian 
      consumers. Spiders incorporated more aquatic than terrestrial insects in their 
      diet, with aquatic insects accounting for 45-90% of spider mass. In three of four 
      invaded trout rivers, we found that the average proportion of aquatic resources 
      in web-building spider diet was higher at fishless sites compared to fish sites. 
      The probability of web-building and ground spiders overlapping into the trophic 
      niche of invasive brown and rainbow trout was as high as 26 and 51%, 
      respectively. In contrast, the probability of spiders overlapping into the 
      trophic niche of native fish was always less than 5%. Our results suggest that 
      spiders share resources with invasive fish. In contrast, spiders had a low 
      probability of trophic overlap with native fish indicating that the traits of 
      invaders may be important in determining their influence on ecosystem subsidies. 
      We have added to the growing body of evidence that invaders can have 
      cross-ecosystem impacts and demonstrated that this can be due to niche overlap.

AB  - Highly migratory marine species pose a challenge for the identification of 
      management units due to the absence of clear oceanographic barriers. The 
      population structure of North Atlantic fin whales has been investigated since the 
      start of whaling operations but is still the subject of an ongoing scientific 
      debate. Here we measured stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen in skin 
      samples collected from 151 individuals from western Iceland, Galicia (NW Spain), 
      the Azores archipelago and the Strait of Gibraltar (SoG). We found spatiotemporal 
      differences in stable isotope ratios suggesting that fin whales sampled in these 
      four areas may share a common feeding ground within the Northeast Atlantic at 
      different times during the year. Our results also suggest that SoG whales use 
      this common feeding ground in summer but exploit Mediterranean resources during 
      the winter months, further supporting the existence of a limited but current 
      exchange of individuals between these two basins.

AB  - Increasing human activities are altering marine ecosystems, which may have 
      ramifications for predator feeding ecology and, thus, the degree of contaminant 
      exposure. We conducted the first investigation of spatiotemporal trends for nine 
      alternative halogenated flame retardants (AHFRs) and their relations with dietary 
      variations in 128 humpback dolphins that were stranded along the northern South 
      China Sea during 2003-2020. We detected the highest levels of seven major AHFRs 
      in humpback dolphins compared with the results reported in cetaceans globally, 
      indicating high AHFR contamination in coastal regions of South China. Dolphins 
      that were stranded near urban regions generally contained higher AHFR 
      concentrations than those that were stranded near rural areas, mirroring the 
      environmental trends of AHFRs occurring in this area. Model-generated diet 
      estimates suggested that humpback dolphins have reduced their consumption of high 
      trophic-level prey in recent years, likely attributable to overfishing-induced 
      prey decline in this region. After adjusting AHFR concentrations due to diet 
      changes, the temporal trends of AHFR contamination in humpback dolphins were only 
      slightly altered. Our results suggest that increasing discharges of AHFRs into 
      the South China Sea during the 2000s and 2010s may have had a greater influence 
      on AHFR trends in humpback dolphins than dietary shifts.

      integrated multi-trophic aquaculture to a broader scale.

AB  - Pollution is one of the most significant issues that is currently impeding the 
      development of fish farming. Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) has the 
      potential to reduce the accumulation of organic wastes in the environment by 
      using taxa of lower trophic levels such as filter feeders. However, the capacity 
      of filter feeders to assimilate significant quantities of fish farm wastes has 
      not yet been fully tested in situ. We analyzed the stable isotopes δ(13)C and 
      δ(15)N in mussels from six fish farms and from six other areas that were not 
      influenced by fish farming, at two water strata (surface and mid-water) across a 
      marked gradient of eutrophication along more than 900 km of coastline in the 
      Western Mediterranean. We found that the mussels did not directly assimilate fish 
      farming wastes. Consequently, fish farming wastes did not constitute a major 
      component of mussel diet, irrespective of local productivity and depth in the 
      water column. These outcomes do not necessarily mean that IMTA is not suitable in 
      other cases, but rather that there should be a shift in the rationale of IMTA by 
      modifying the concept of direct assimilation of wastes to a more general approach 
      of IMTA based on regional budgets of nutrients.

TI  - Millennial-scale isotope records from a wide-ranging predator show evidence of 
      recent human impact to oceanic food webs.
PG  - 8972-7
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1300213110 [doi]
AB  - Human exploitation of marine ecosystems is more recent in oceanic than near shore 
      regions, yet our understanding of human impacts on oceanic food webs is 
      comparatively poor. Few records of species that live beyond the continental 
      shelves date back more than 60 y, and the sheer size of oceanic regions makes 
      their food webs difficult to study, even in modern times. Here, we use stable 
      carbon and nitrogen isotopes to study the foraging history of a generalist, 
      oceanic predator, the Hawaiian petrel (Pterodroma sandwichensis), which ranges 
      broadly in the Pacific from the equator to near the Aleutian Islands. Our isotope 
      records from modern and ancient, radiocarbon-dated bones provide evidence of over 
      3,000 y of dietary stasis followed by a decline of ca. 1.8‰ in δ(15)N over the 
      past 100 y. Fishery-induced trophic decline is the most likely explanation for 
      this sudden shift, which occurs in genetically distinct populations with 
      disparate foraging locations. Our isotope records also show that coincident with 
      the apparent decline in trophic level, foraging segregation among petrel 
      populations decreased markedly. Because variation in the diet of generalist 
      predators can reflect changing availability of their prey, a foraging shift in 
      wide-ranging Hawaiian petrel populations suggests a relatively rapid change in 
      the composition of oceanic food webs in the Northeast Pacific. Understanding and 
      mitigating widespread shifts in prey availability may be a critical step in the 
      conservation of endangered marine predators such as the Hawaiian petrel.

TI  - Trophic ecology of Lampanyctus crocodilus on north-west Mediterranean Sea slopes 
      in relation to reproductive cycle and environmental variables.
PG  - 1654-88
LID - 10.1111/jfb.12378 [doi]
AB  - This study examined the population structure, reproductive cycle and feeding 
      pattern of the lanternfish Lampanyctus crocodilus in the Balearic Basin 
      (north-west Mediterranean Sea) from a depth of 450 to 1800 m and at a seasonal 
      scale. Juveniles were mainly located at shallower depths, but also at deepest 
      stations in autumn, while adults mostly inhabited intermediate depths with their 
      centre of population density (CPD) located at 800-1000 m of depth. The migration 
      of adults to deeper depths was detected in late summer to autumn, probably linked 
      to the occurrence of nepheloid layers at c. 1200 m, which in turn enhances the 
      biomass of the zooplankton prey. The diet was mainly based on euphausiids and 
      mysids, with marked seasonal variations both on the upper (450-800 m) and lower 
      (1000-1800 m), where suprabenthic gammariids and pelagic decapods were also 
      dominant. Stomach fullness increased from winter to autumn on the US, while it 
      had a maximum in spring on the LS, in parallel with high consumption of 
      gelatinous zooplankton, which is probably more available after the phytoplankton 
      bloom in late winter. Reproduction occurred in winter, confirmed by the higher 
      percentage of mature females and high gonadosomatic indices (I(G)) at both depth 
      ranges. Hepatosomatic indices (I(H)) showed an inverse trend to I(G) on the US, 
      except in autumn, and was almost parallel on the LS, probably attributable to the 
      migration of adults, which determined different temporal schemes in energy use 
      and storage for reproduction on the US v. LS. Consistent with the different 
      patterns observed at the two depth ranges, environmental drivers of fullness 
      (i.e. feeding intensity) and I(G) (as a proxy of reproductive cycle) differed on 
      the US and LS. The biomass of mysids and euphausiids was the greatest explanatory 
      variables of fullness on the US and LS, pointing to the increasing feeding 
      intensity when a resource was more available. I(H) also explained fullness, 
      suggesting that greater feeding intensity in pre-reproductive periods enabled 
      energy storage in the liver. I(G) was linked directly (i.e. mysids) or indirectly 
      (i.e. surface primary production recorded 2 months before sampling) to food 
      availability, implying a rapid response to vertical food inputs by deep-sea 
      predators. Also, I(G) in L. crocodilus was related to population density, which 
      suggests aggregations for reproduction. Estimates of L. crocodilus trophic 
      levels, and of other accompanying mesopelagic fishes, indicated that the species 
      feed through a continuum spanning the third trophic level, confirming the key 
      role of mesopelagic fishes in transferring organic carbon between trophic levels. 
      Trophic niche segregation among mesopelagic species was pronounced and 
      non-overlapping groups could be distinguished because of the different vertical 
      distribution and migratory behaviour. The study highlights the important role of 
      the benthic boundary layer in sustaining benthopelagic communities in the deep 
      Mediterranean Sea and the need to study the biology of a species throughout its 
      whole depth range and not just at exploited depths (i.e. fishing grounds).

TI  - The fate of nitrogen in grain cropping systems: a meta-analysis of 15N field 
      experiments.
PG  - 2167-84
AB  - Intensively managed grain farms are saturated with large inputs of nitrogen (N) 
      fertilizer, leading to N losses and environmental degradation. Despite decades of 
      research directed toward reducing N losses from agroecosystems, progress has been 
      minimal, and the currently promoted best management practices are not necessarily 
      the most effective. We investigated the fate of N additions to temperate grain 
      agroecosystems using a meta-analysis of 217 field-scale studies that followed the 
      stable isotope 15N in crops and soil. We compared management practices that alter 
      inorganic fertilizer additions, such as application timing or reduced N 
      fertilizer rates, to practices that re-couple the biogeochemical cycles of carbon 
      (C) and N, such as organic N sources and diversified crop rotations, and analyzed 
      the following response variables: 15N recovery in crops, total recovery of 15N in 
      crops and soil, and crop yield. More of the literature (94%) emphasized crop 
      recovery of 15N than total 15N recovery in crops and soil (58%), though total 
      recovery is a more ecologically appropriate indicator for assessing N losses. 
      Findings show wide differences in the ability of management practices to improve 
      N use efficiency. Practices that aimed to increase crop uptake of commercial 
      fertilizer had a lower impact on total 15N recovery (3-21% increase) than 
      practices that re-coupled C and N cycling (30-42% increase). A majority of 
      studies (66%) were only one growing season long, which poses a particular problem 
      when organic N sources are used because crops recover N from these sources over 
      several years. These short-term studies neglect significant ecological processes 
      that occur over longer time scales. Field-scale mass balance calculations using 
      the 15N data set show that, on average, 43 kg N x ha(-1) x yr(-1) was unaccounted 
      for at the end of one growing season out of 114 kg N x ha(-1) x yr(-1), 
      representing approximately 38% of the total 15N applied. This comprehensive 
      assessment of stable-isotope research on agroecosystem N management can inform 
      the development of policies to mitigate nonpoint source pollution. Nitrogen 
      management practices that most effectively increase N retention are not currently 
      being promoted and are rare on the landscape in the United States.

TI  - Altered trophic pathway and parasitism in a native predator (Lepomis gibbosus) 
      feeding on introduced prey (Dreissena polymorpha).
PG  - 315-24
LID - 10.1007/s00442-014-2898-6 [doi]
AB  - Populations of invasive species tend to have fewer parasites in their introduced 
      ranges than in their native ranges and are also thought to have fewer parasites 
      than native prey. This 'release' from parasites has unstudied implications for 
      native predators feeding on exotic prey. In particular, shifts from native to 
      exotic prey should reduce levels of trophically transmitted parasites. We tested 
      this hypothesis in native populations of pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) 
      in Lake Opinicon, where fish stomach contents were studied intensively in the 
      1970s, prior to the appearance of exotic zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in 
      the mid-1990s. Zebra mussels were common in stomachs of present-day pumpkinseeds, 
      and stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen confirmed their importance in 
      long-term diets. Because historical parasite data were not available in Lake 
      Opinicon, we also surveyed stomach contents and parasites in pumpkinseed in both 
      Lake Opinicon and an ecologically similar, neighboring lake where zebra mussels 
      were absent. Stomach contents of pumpkinseed in the companion lake did not differ 
      from those of pre-invasion fish from Lake Opinicon. The companion lake, 
      therefore, served as a surrogate "pre-invasion" reference to assess effects of 
      zebra mussel consumption on parasites in pumpkinseed. Trophically transmitted 
      parasites were less species-rich and abundant in Lake Opinicon, where fish fed on 
      zebra mussels, although factors other than zebra mussel consumption may 
      contribute to these differences. Predation on zebra mussels has clearly 
      contributed to a novel trophic coupling between littoral and pelagic food webs in 
      Lake Opinicon.

TI  - Soil H₂¹⁸O labelling reveals the effect of drought on C¹⁸OO fluxes to the 
      atmosphere.
PG  - 5783-93
LID - 10.1093/jxb/eru312 [doi]
AB  - Above- and belowground processes in plants are tightly coupled via carbon and 
      water fluxes through the soil-plant-atmosphere system. The oxygen isotopic 
      composition of atmospheric CO₂ and water vapour (H₂Ov) provides a valuable tool 
      for investigating the transport and cycling of carbon and water within this 
      system. However, detailed studies on the coupling between ecosystem components 
      and environmental drivers are sparse. Therefore, we conducted a H2 
      (18)O-labelling experiment to investigate the effect of drought on the speed of 
      the link between below- and aboveground processes and its subsequent effect on 
      C(18)OO released by leaves and soils. A custom-made chamber system, separating 
      shoot from soil compartments, allowed separate measurements of shoot- and 
      soil-related processes under controlled conditions. Gas exchange of oxygen stable 
      isotopes in CO₂ and H₂Ov served as the main tool of investigation and was 
      monitored in real time on Fagus sylvatica saplings using laser spectroscopy. 
      H₂(18)O-labelling showed that drought caused a slower transport of water 
      molecules from soil to shoot, which was indicated by its direct derivation from 
      independently measured concentrations and (18)O/(16)O ratios of CO₂ and H₂Ov, 
      respectively. Furthermore, drought reduced the (18)O equilibrium between H₂O and 
      CO₂ at the shoot level, resulting in less-enriched C(18)OO fluxes from leaf to 
      atmosphere compared with control plants. Compared with the shoot, (18)O 
      equilibrium was not instantaneous in the soil and no drought effect was apparent.

TI  - Variable wind, pack ice, and prey dispersion affect the long-term adequacy of 
      protected areas for an Arctic sea duck.
PG  - 396-412
AB  - With changing climate, delineation of protected areas for sensitive species must 
      account for long-term variability and geographic shifts of key habitat elements. 
      Projecting the future adequacy of protected areas requires knowing major factors 
      that drive such changes, and how readily the animals adjust to altered resources. 
      In the Arctic, the viability of habitats for marine birds and mammals often 
      depends on sea ice to dissipate storm waves and provide platforms for resting. 
      However, some wind conditions (including weak winds during extreme cold) can 
      consolidate pack ice into cover so dense that air-breathing divers are excluded 
      from the better feeding areas. Spectacled Eiders (Somateria fischeri) winter 
      among leads (openings) in pack ice in areas where densities of their bivalve prey 
      are quite high. During winter 2009, however, prevailing winds created a large 
      region of continuous ice with inadequate leads to allow access to areas of dense 
      preferred prey. Stable isotope and fatty acid biomarkers indicated that, under 
      these conditions, the eiders did not diversify their diet to include abundant 
      non-bivalve taxa but did add a smaller, less preferred, bivalve species. 
      Consistent with a computer model of eider energy balance, the body fat of adult 
      eiders in 2009 was 33-35% lower than on the same date (19 March) in 2001 when ice 
      conditions allowed access to higher bivalve densities. Ice cover data suggest 
      that the eiders were mostly excluded from areas of high bivalve density from 
      January to March in about 30% of 14 winters from 1998 to 2011. Thus, even without 
      change in total extent of ice, shifts in prevailing winds can alter the areal 
      density of ice to reduce access to important habitats. Because changes in 
      wind-driven currents can also rearrange the dispersion of prey, the potential for 
      altered wind patterns should be an important concern in projecting effects of 
      climate change on the adequacy of marine protected areas for diving endotherms in 
      the Arctic.

TI  - The partitioning of water uptake between growth forms in a Neotropical savanna: 
      do herbs exploit a third water source niche?
PG  - 84-92
LID - 10.1111/j.1438-8677.2012.00618.x [doi]
AB  - In addition to trees and grasses, the savannas of central Brazil are 
      characterised by a diverse herbaceous dicot flora. Here we tested whether the 
      coexistence of a highly diversified assemblage of species resulted in 
      stratification or strong overlap in the use of soil water resources. We measured 
      oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios of stem water from herbs, grasses and trees 
      growing side by side, as well as the isotopic composition of water in soil 
      profile, groundwater and rainfall, and predawn (Ψ(pd)) and midday (Ψ(md)) leaf 
      water potentials. We used a stable isotope mixing model to estimate vertical 
      partitioning of soil water by the three growth forms. Grasses relied on shallow 
      soil water (5-50 cm) and were strongly anisohydric. Ψ(pd) and Ψ(md) decreased 
      significantly from the wet to the dry season. Trees extracted water from deeper 
      regions of the soil profile (60-120 cm) and were isohydric. Ψ(pd) and Ψ(md) did 
      not change from the wet to the dry season. Herbs overlapped with grasses in 
      patterns of water extraction in the dry season (between 10 and 40 cm), but they 
      took up water at soil depths intermediate (70-100 cm) to those of trees and 
      grasses during the wet season. They showed seasonal changes in Ψ(pd) but not in 
      Ψ(md). We conclude that vertical partitioning of soil water may have contributed 
      to coexistence of these three growth forms and resulted in a more complex pattern 
      of soil water extraction than the two-compartment model of soil water uptake 
      currently used to explain the structure and function of tropical savanna 
      ecosystems.

TI  - History of Animals using Isotope Records (HAIR): a 6-year dietary history of one 
      family of African elephants.
PG  - 8093-100
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0902192106 [doi]
AB  - The dietary and movement history of individual animals can be studied using 
      stable isotope records in animal tissues, providing insight into long-term 
      ecological dynamics and a species niche. We provide a 6-year history of elephant 
      diet by examining tail hair collected from 4 elephants in the same social family 
      unit in northern Kenya. Sequential measurements of carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen 
      isotope rations in hair provide a weekly record of diet and water resources. 
      Carbon isotope ratios were well correlated with satellite-based measurements of 
      the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of the region occupied by the 
      elephants as recorded by the global positioning system (GPS) movement record; the 
      absolute amount of C(4) grass consumption is well correlated with the maximum 
      value of NDVI during individual wet seasons. Changes in hydrogen isotope ratios 
      coincided very closely in time with seasonal fluctuations in rainfall and NDVI 
      whereas diet shifts to relatively high proportions of grass lagged seasonal 
      increases in NDVI by approximately 2 weeks. The peak probability of conception in 
      the population occurred approximately 3 weeks after peak grazing. Spatial and 
      temporal patterns of resource use show that the only period of pure browsing by 
      the focal elephants was located in an over-grazed, communally managed region 
      outside the protected area. The ability to extract time-specific longitudinal 
      records on animal diets, and therefore the ecological history of an organism and 
      its environment, provides an avenue for understanding the impact of climate 
      dynamics and land-use change on animal foraging behavior and habitat relations.

AB  - *Humans are increasing both the deposition of reactive nitrogen (N) and 
      concentrations of atmospheric CO(2) on Earth, but the combined effects on 
      terrestrial ecosystems are not clear. In the absence of historical records, it is 
      difficult to know if N availability is currently increasing or decreasing on 
      regional scales. *To determine the nature and timing of past changes in grassland 
      ecosystem dynamics, we measured the composition of stable carbon (C) and N 
      isotopes in leaf tissue from 545 herbarium specimens of 24 vascular plant species 
      collected in Kansas, USA from 1876 to 2008. We also parameterized a simple model 
      of the terrestrial N cycle coupled with a stable isotope simulator to constrain 
      processes consistent with observed patterns. *A prolonged decline in foliar N 
      concentrations began in 1926, while a prolonged decline in foliar delta(15)N 
      values began in 1940. Changes in the difference between foliar and atmospheric C 
      isotopes reveal slightly increased photosynthetic water use efficiency since 
      1876. *The declines in foliar N concentrations and foliar delta(15)N suggest 
      declining N availability in these grasslands during the 20th century despite 
      decades of anthropogenic N deposition. Our results are consistent with 
      progressive-nitrogen-limitation-type hypotheses where declines in N availability 
      are driven by increased ecosystem N storage as a result of increased atmospheric 
      CO(2).

AB  - We combined stable isotope tracers of blood plasma, blood cells and egg contents 
      with faecal analysis during pre-breeding and egg laying phases in two dipper 
      species Cinclus cinclus and Cinclus mexicanus to determine the occurrence of 
      dietary shifts during egg production and to assess consequences for egg 
      contaminant loads. In both species, changes in delta(13)C (C. cinclus) or 
      delta(15)N (C. mexicanus) in female plasma relative to red blood cells indicated 
      a dietary shift during laying that was not observed in males. Eurasian dippers 
      increased prey consumption as breeding approached, shifting from primarily 
      trichopteran insect larvae to ephemeropterans and plecopterans. In American 
      dippers, egg-laying females switched to feeding at a higher trophic level by 
      consuming more fish. Eggs derived from higher trophic level diets contained more 
      mercury (American dipper), polychlorinated biphenyls and some organochlorines, 
      especially DDT metabolites. The results demonstrate how dietary changes during 
      egg laying accompany the demands for egg production with consequences for 
      contaminant deposition in avian eggs.

TI  - Temporal diet changes recorded by stable isotopes in Asiatic black bear (Ursus 
      thibetanus) hair.
PG  - 87-94
AB  - Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios were measured in hair samples of the 
      Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus) inhabiting the Northern Japanese Alps (NJA) 
      (n = 20) and the periphery of Nagano City (NC) (n = 6), in Nagano Prefecture, 
      Japan. The hair of NJA bears, which did not have access to anthropogenic foods, 
      showed lower values of d13C and d15N than that of NC bears which had access to 
      garbage and corn fields, especially during the summer. These results reflect 
      somewhat differing diets between the NJA and NC bears. We attempted to assess the 
      feeding history during the hair growth cycle using the growth section analysis 
      method. Each hair sample had been cut into 3?mm lengths from root to tip, 
      labeled, and analyzed along the hair growth. We measured the carbon and nitrogen 
      stable isotope ratios of each 3?mm length of hair sample from one NC bear which 
      had been killed while raiding a corn field. The sections showed wide ranges of 
      isotope ratios, from -23.2% to -14.6% for delta13C, and from 0.3% to 4.6% for 
      delta15N. It was shown that the diet of this bear shifted dramatically from 
      principally C3 plants to more C4 plants and to foods of animal origin. An 
      analysis of the whole hair reflects just the average feeding habit during hair 
      growth, but the present method can trace its diet history. This method can 
      contribute to obtain precise ecological information of wildlife.

TI  - Apportioning source of erosion-induced organic matter in the hilly-gully region

AB  - Understanding the dynamics of organic matter (OM) at global and local scales is 
      one of the challenges in the environmental sciences and i.e. terrestrial 
      biogeochemistry. The accurate identification of OM is an essential element to 
      achieve this goal. In our study, a novel application for quantitatively 
      apportioning sources of eroded sedimentary OM from an eco-geomorphologic 
      perspective was shown successfully via a coupled molecular n-alkane biomarkers 
      and stable isotopic signatures ((13)C and (15)N) along with elemental 
      compositions (TOC and TN) using a Bayesian mixing model (SIAR). Soil source 
      samples were collected from different land use types (i.e., forests, grassland, 
      cropland, and fallow) and gully, which were probably transported downstream along 
      the steep terrain. Meanwhile, three soil profiles with a total of 90 sediment 
      samples were also sampled in check dam. The results indicated that cropland was 
      the main sedimentary OM source in this catchment, contributing 29.5%, whereas the 
      forests, grassland, fallow and gully contributed 12.17%, 15.39%, 21.53% and 
      21.85%, respectively. Although the molecular biomarker as a tracer was not valid 
      solely, the combined approaches of n-alkanes biomarker and bulk parameters were 
      efficient complements in tracing OM source in a hilly-gully region on the Loess 
      Plateau of China.

TI  - The effect of physical back-diffusion of 13CO2 tracer on the coupling between 
      photosynthesis and soil CO2 efflux in grassland.
PG  - 497-513
LID - 10.1080/10256016.2014.893237 [doi]
AB  - Pulse labelling experiments provide a common tool to study short-term processes 
      in the plant-soil system and investigate below-ground carbon allocation as well 
      as the coupling of soil CO(2) efflux to photosynthesis. During the first hours 
      after pulse labelling, the measured isotopic signal of soil CO(2) efflux is a 
      combination of both physical tracer diffusion into and out of the soil as well as 
      biological tracer release via root and microbial respiration. Neglecting physical 
      back-diffusion can lead to misinterpretation regarding time lags between 
      photosynthesis and soil CO(2) efflux in grassland or any ecosystem type where the 
      above-ground plant parts cannot be labelled in gas-tight chambers separated from 
      the soil. We studied the effects of physical (13)CO(2) tracer back-diffusion in 
      pulse labelling experiments in grassland, focusing on the isotopic signature of 
      soil CO(2) efflux. Having accounted for back-diffusion, the estimated time lag 
      for first tracer appearance in soil CO(2) efflux changed from 0 to 1.81±0.56 h 
      (mean±SD) and the time lag for maximum tracer appearance from 2.67±0.39 to 
      9.63±3.32 h (mean±SD). Thus, time lags were considerably longer when physical 
      tracer diffusion was considered. Using these time lags after accounting for 
      physical back-diffusion, high nocturnal soil CO(2) efflux rates could be related 
      to daytime rates of gross primary productivity (R(2)=0.84). Moreover, pronounced 
      diurnal patterns in the δ(13)C of soil CO(2) efflux were found during the decline 
      of the tracer over 3 weeks. Possible mechanisms include diurnal changes in the 
      relative contributions of autotrophic and heterotrophic soil respiration as well 
      as their respective δ(13)C values. Thus, after accounting for physical 
      back-diffusion, we were able to quantify biological time lags in the coupling of 
      photosynthesis and soil CO(2) efflux in grassland at the diurnal time scale.

TI  - Phosphate availability affects fixed nitrogen transfer from diazotrophs to their 
      epibionts.
PG  - 2701-2713

AB  - Dinitrogen (N(2)) fixation is a major source of external nitrogen (N) to aquatic 
      ecosystems and therefore exerts control over productivity. Studies have shown 
      that N(2) -fixers release freshly fixed N into the environment, but the causes 
      for this N release are largely unclear. Here, we show that the availability of 
      phosphate can directly affect the transfer of freshly fixed N to epibionts in 
      filamentous, diazotrophic cyanobacteria. Stable-isotope incubations coupled to 
      single-cell analyses showed that <1% and ~15% of freshly fixed N was transferred 
      to epibionts of Aphanizomenon and Nodularia, respectively, at phosphate scarcity 
      during a summer bloom in the Baltic Sea. When phosphate was added, the transfer 
      of freshly fixed N to epibionts dropped to about half for Nodularia, whereas the 
      release from Aphanizomenon increased slightly. At the same time, the growth rate 
      of Nodularia roughly doubled, indicating that less freshly fixed N was released 
      and was used for biomass production instead. Phosphate scarcity and the resulting 
      release of freshly fixed N could explain the heavy colonization of Nodularia 
      filaments by microorganisms during summer blooms. As such, the availability of 
      phosphate may directly affect the partitioning of fixed N(2) in colonies of 
      diazotrophic cyanobacteria and may impact the interactions with their microbiome.

AB  - Stable isotope measurements are increasingly being used to gain insights into the 
      nutritional ecology of many wildlife species and their role in ecosystem 
      structure and function. Such studies require estimations of trophic 
      discrimination factors (i.e. differences in the isotopic ratio between the 
      consumer and its diet). Although trophic discrimination factors are tissue- and 
      species-specific, researchers often rely on generalized, and fixed trophic 
      discrimination factors that have not been experimentally derived. In this 
      experimental study, captive wild boar (Sus scrofa) were fed a controlled diet of 
      corn (Zea mays), a popular and increasingly dominant food source for wild boar in 
      the Czech Republic and elsewhere in Europe, and trophic discrimination factors 
      for stable carbon (Δ13C) and nitrogen (Δ15N) isotopes were determined from hair 
      samples. The mean Δ13C and Δ15N in wild boar hair were -2.3‰ and +3.5‰, 
      respectively. Also, in order to facilitate future derivations of isotopic 
      measurements along wild boar hair, we calculated the average hair growth rate to 
      be 1.1 mm d(-1). Our results serve as a baseline for interpreting isotopic 
      patterns of free-ranging wild boar in current European agricultural landscapes. 
      However, future research is needed in order to provide a broader understanding of 
      the processes underlying the variation in trophic discrimination factors of 
      carbon and nitrogen across of variety of diet types.

TI  - Trophic ecology of invasive Argentine ants in their native and introduced ranges.
PG  - 20856-61
AB  - Although the ecological effects of invasions often become obvious soon after 
      introduced species become established, more gradual effects may take years to 
      manifest and can thus require long-term data for quantification. We analyzed an 
      8-year record of stable isotope data on Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) from 
      southern California to infer how the trophic position of this widespread invasive 
      species changes over time as native ant species are displaced. We couple this 
      longitudinal analysis with a biregional comparison of stable isotope data 
      (delta(15)N) on ants from Argentina (native range) and California (introduced 
      range) to quantify (i) how the trophic position of L. humile differs between 
      native and introduced populations, and (ii) how relative trophic position as 
      estimated by delta(15)N values of Argentine ants compare with those of other ants 
      at the same site. Both long-term and biregional comparisons indicate that the 
      Argentine ant's relative trophic position is reduced at sites with a longer 
      history of occupation. Over the course of 8 years, the relative trophic position 
      of L. humile remained high at the leading edge of an invasion front but declined, 
      on average, behind the front as native ants disappeared. Relative to native 
      populations, where L. humile is among the most carnivorous of ants, Argentine 
      ants from California occupied lower trophic positions. These results support the 
      hypothesis that Argentine ants shift their diet after establishment as a result 
      of resource depletion and increasing reliance on plant-based resources, 
      especially honeydew-producing Hemiptera. Our results demonstrate the value of 
      long-term and biregional data in uncovering ecological effects of invasions.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) is a pervasive contaminant that can adversely affect predatory 
      wildlife. Bird eggs provide insights into breeding females' Hg burdens, and are 
      easily collected and archived. We present data on Hg trends in herring gull 
      (Larus argentatus) eggs from five sites in Atlantic Canada from 1972 to 2008. We 
      found a significant decrease in Hg at Manawagonish Island, New Brunswick and Île 
      du Corossol, Quebec, but after correcting Hg for dietary shifts using stable 
      isotopes (δ(15)N), these trends disappeared. Decreasing temporal trends of stable 
      isotopes in gull eggs were observed at four sites, suggesting shifts in gull 
      diets. At Gull Island, Newfoundland, diet-adjusted Hg increased from 1977 to 
      1992, dropped sharply between 1992 and 1996, and rose again from 1996 to 2008. 
      After adjusting Hg trends for dietary shifts of herring gulls, it appears that 
      environmental Hg in coastal ecosystems has remained relatively constant at most 
      sites in Atlantic Canada over the last 36 years.

TI  - Do low-mercury terrestrial resources subsidize low-mercury growth of stream fish? 
      Differences between species along a productivity gradient.
PG  - e49582
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0049582 [doi]
LID - e49582
AB  - Low productivity in aquatic ecosystems is associated with reduced individual 
      growth of fish and increased concentrations of methylmercury (MeHg) in fish and 
      their prey. However, many stream-dwelling fish species can use 
      terrestrially-derived food resources, potentially subsidizing growth at 
      low-productivity sites, and, because terrestrial resources have lower MeHg 
      concentrations than aquatic resources, preventing an increase in diet-borne MeHg 
      accumulation. We used a large-scale field study to evaluate relationships among 
      terrestrial subsidy use, growth, and MeHg concentrations in two stream-dwelling 
      fish species across an in-stream productivity gradient. We sampled 
      young-of-the-year brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo 
      salar), potential competitors with similar foraging habits, from 20 study sites 
      in streams in New Hampshire and Massachusetts that encompassed a wide range of 
      aquatic prey biomass. Stable isotope analysis showed that brook trout used more 
      terrestrial resources than Atlantic salmon. Over their first growing season, 
      Atlantic salmon tended to grow larger than brook trout at sites with high aquatic 
      prey biomass, but brook grew two-fold larger than Atlantic salmon at sites with 
      low aquatic prey biomass. The MeHg concentrations of brook trout and Atlantic 
      salmon were similar at sites with high aquatic prey biomass and the MeHg 
      concentrations of both species increased at sites with low prey biomass and high 
      MeHg in aquatic prey. However, brook trout had three-fold lower MeHg 
      concentrations than Atlantic salmon at low-productivity, high-MeHg sites. These 
      results suggest that differential use of terrestrial resource subsidies reversed 
      the growth asymmetry between potential competitors across a productivity gradient 
      and, for one species, moderated the effect of low in-stream productivity on MeHg 
      accumulation.

AB  - Trophic transfer of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in aquatic ecosystems 
      is an important criterion for assessing their environmental risk. This study 
      analyzed 13 PBDEs in marine organisms collected from coastal area of Bohai Bay, 
      China. The concentrations of total PBDEs (Σ13PBDEs) ranged from 12 ± 1.1 ng/g wet 
      weight (ww) to 230 ± 54 ng/g ww depending on species. BDE-47 was the predominant 
      compound, with a mean abundance of 20.21 ± 12.97% of total PBDEs. Stable isotopic 
      ratios of carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) were analyzed to determine the 
      food web structure and trophic level respectively. Trophic magnification factors 
      (TMFs) of PBDEs were assessed as the slope of lipid equivalent concentrations 
      regressed against trophic levels. Significant positive relationships were found 
      for Σ13PBDEs and eight PBDE congeners (BDE-28, BDE-47, BDE-49, BDE-66, BDE-85, 
      BDE-99, BDE-100 and BDE-154). Monte-Carlo simulations showed that the 
      probabilities of TMF >1 were 100% for Σ13PBDEs, BDE-47, BDE-85, BDE-99 and 
      BDE-100, 99% for DE-28, BDE-49, BDE-66 and BDE-154, 94% for BDE-153, and 35% for

TI  - Abrupt recent shift in delta 13C and delta 15N values in Adélie penguin eggshell 
      in Antarctica.
PG  - 11666-9
AB  - Stable isotope values of carbon (delta13C) and nitrogen (delta15N) in blood, 
      feathers, eggshell, and bone have been used in seabird studies since the 1980s, 
      providing a valuable source of information on diet, foraging patterns, and 
      migratory behavior in these birds. These techniques can also be applied to fossil 
      material when preservation of bone and other tissues is sufficient. Excavations 
      of abandoned Adélie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) colonies in Antarctica often 
      provide well preserved remains of bone, feathers, and eggshell dating from 
      hundreds to thousands of years B.P. Herein we present an approximately 
      38,000-year time series of delta13C and delta15N values of Adélie penguin 
      eggshell from abandoned colonies located in three major regions of Antarctica. 
      Results indicate an abrupt shift to lower-trophic prey in penguin diets within 
      the past approximately 200 years. We posit that penguins only recently began to 
      rely on krill as a major portion of their diet, in conjunction with the removal 
      of baleen whales and krill-eating seals during the historic whaling era. Our 
      results support the "krill surplus" hypothesis that predicts excess krill 
      availability in the Southern Ocean after this period of exploitation.

AB  - Degradation tests with radio or stable isotope labeled compounds enable the 
      detection of the formation of nonextractable residues (NER). In PBT and vPvB 
      assessment, remobilisable NER are considered as a potential risk while biogenic 
      NER from incorporation of labeled carbon into microbial biomass are treated as 
      degradation products. Relationships between yield, released CO(2) (as indicator 
      of microbial activity and mineralization) and microbial growth can be used to 
      estimate the formation of biogenic NER. We provide a new approach for calculation 
      of potential substrate transformation to microbial biomass (theoretical yield) 
      based on Gibbs free energy and microbially available electrons. We compare 
      estimated theoretical yields of biotechnological substrates and of chemicals of 
      environmental concern with experimentally determined yields for validation of the 
      presented approach. A five-compartment dynamic model is applied to simulate 
      experiments of (13)C-labeled 2,4-D and ibuprofen turnover. The results show that 
      bioNER increases with time, and that most bioNER originates from microbial 
      proteins. Simulations with precalculated input data demonstrate that 
      precalculation of yields reduces the number of fit parameters considerably, 
      increases confidence in fitted kinetic data, and reduces the uncertainty of the 
      simulation results.

      three Ammodramus sparrows.
PG  - 54-9
LID - 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.01.003 [doi]
AB  - We analyzed nitrogen and carbon stable isotope ratios and mercury (Hg) in breast 
      feathers from three species of closely related sparrows, Saltmarsh, Seaside, and 
      Nelson's Sparrows (Ammodramus caudacutus, A. maritimus, and A. nelsoni, 
      respectively), to assess if trophic position and food web structure influence Hg 
      exposure in these species. Sparrows were captured during the non-breeding season 
      from 2006 to 2008 in North Carolina salt marshes near Wrightsville Beach, New 
      Hanover County. Generalized linear models were used to test for the influence of 
      species, δ(15)N, and δ(13)C on breast feather Hg. The most parsimonious model 
      included species, δ(15)N, and their interaction term and explained 36% of the 
      variation in breast feather Hg. Each species exhibited a different association 
      between breast feather δ(15)N and Hg with Seaside Sparrows showing a positive 
      correlation (r=0.27, P=0.03), Nelson's Sparrows a negative correlation (r=-0.28, 
      P=0.01), and Saltmarsh Sparrows with no significant association. For Saltmarsh 
      Sparrows, δ(15)N and Hg revealed decoupling between breast feather Hg and trophic 
      position. Our results demonstrate that the influence of δ(15)N on breast feather 
      Hg is likely indicative of geographic variation in δ(15)N baselines rather than 
      trophic position.

AB  - This study assesses the effects of dredged material disposal in a recurrent 
      marine dump near the Guadalquivir Estuary (south-western Spain). We compared the 
      changes observed with two reference areas combining a classical ecological 
      approach with new stable isotope techniques to analyse trophic structure. We 
      detected permanent changes in the macrofaunal community structure as well as in 
      the diversity and biotic indices applied, which showed higher values in the 
      disposal area. The community in the marine dump had lost the natural temporal 
      variations observed in the reference areas. These effects could be due to the 
      last disposal event carried out in the summer of 2015 or to the recurrent 
      disposals since 2010. Despite the structural changes shown by the benthic 
      community, these impacts were not reflected in the food web structure of the 
      marine dump. Our results confirm the high variability of disposal disturbances. 
      Hence, we recommend performing studies in every disposal event, merging different 
      functional and structural approaches.

TI  - Speciation of americium in seawater and accumulation in the marine sponge 
      Aplysina cavernicola.
PG  - 20584-96
LID - 10.1039/c5dt02805a [doi]
AB  - The fate of radionuclides in the environment is a cause of great concern for 
      modern society, seen especially in 2011 after the Fukushima accident. Among the 
      environmental compartments, seawater covers most of the earth's surface and may 
      be directly or indirectly impacted. The interaction between radionuclides and the 
      marine compartment is therefore essential for better understanding the transfer 
      mechanisms from the hydrosphere to the biosphere. This information allows for the 
      evaluation of the impact on humans via our interaction with the biotope that has 
      been largely undocumented up to now. In this report, we attempt to make a link 
      between the speciation of heavy elements in natural seawater and their uptake by 
      a model marine organism. More specifically, because the interaction of actinides 
      with marine invertebrates has been poorly studied, the accumulation in a 
      representative member of the Mediterranean coralligenous habitat, the sponge 
      Aplysina cavernicola, was investigated and its uptake curve exposed to a 
      radiotracer (241)Am was estimated using a high-purity Ge gamma spectrometer. But 
      in order to go beyond the phenomenological accumulation rate, the speciation of 
      americium(III) in seawater must be assessed. The speciation of (241)Am (and 
      natural europium as its chemically stable surrogate) in seawater was determined 
      using a combination of different techniques: Time-Resolved Laser-Induced 
      Fluorescence (TRLIF), Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) at the 
      LIII edge, Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) 
      spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and the resulting data were 
      compared with the speciation modeling. In seawater, the americium(III) complex 
      (as well as the corresponding europium complex, although with conformational 
      differences) was identified as a ternary sodium biscarbonato complex, whose 
      formula can be tentatively written as NaAm(CO3)2·nH2O. It is therefore this 
      chemical form of americium that is accumulated by the sponge A. cavernicola.

TI  - Extinction and ecological retreat in a community of primates.
PG  - 3597-605
AB  - The lemurs of Madagascar represent a prodigious adaptive radiation. At least 17 
      species ranging from 11 to 160 kg have become extinct during the past 2000 years. 
      The effect of this loss on contemporary lemurs is unknown. The concept of 
      competitive release favours the expansion of living species into vacant niches. 
      Alternatively, factors that triggered the extinction of some species could have 
      also reduced community-wide niche breadth. Here, we use radiocarbon and stable 
      isotope data to examine temporal shifts in the niches of extant lemur species 
      following the extinction of eight large-bodied species. We focus on southwestern 
      Madagascar and report profound isotopic shifts, both from the time when 
      now-extinct lemurs abounded and from the time immediately following their decline 
      to the present. Unexpectedly, the past environments exploited by lemurs were 
      drier than the protected (albeit often degraded) riparian habitats assumed to be 
      ideal for lemurs today. Neither competitive release nor niche contraction can 
      explain these observed trends. We develop an alternative hypothesis: ecological 
      retreat, which suggests that factors surrounding extinction may force surviving 
      species into marginal or previously unfilled niches.

TI  - Combined Experimental and Computational Study on the Transformation of a Novel 
      1,3,4-Oxadiazole Thioether Nematicide in Aqueous Solutions.
PG  - 8963-8973
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.2c02649 [doi]
AB  - It has been demonstrated that Exianliuyimi (EXLYM) exhibits good nematocidal 
      activity. As a potential nematicide, EXLYM and its transformation products (TPs) 
      may generate emerging pollutants with hazardous effects on the ecosystem. In this 
      study, the fate of EXLYM in aqueous solutions was investigated using experimental 
      and theoretical approaches. Laboratory-scale experiments showed that EXLYM is 
      hydrolytically stable. Microbial processes are primarily responsible for the 
      oxidation of sulfur in aqueous solutions. Under simulated sunlight, the t(1/2) 
      values of EXLYM in acidic, neutral, and alkaline buffer solutions were 5.02, 
      3.83, and 5.55 h, respectively. Six TPs were identified using a non-target 
      screening strategy realized by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography 
      coupled with Q-Exactive Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry and 
      (18)O-labeling experiments. Four of these were unambiguously confirmed using 
      authentic standards. Reactive oxygen species scavenging experiments, 
      (18)O-labeling experiments, and quantum-theoretical calculations suggested that 
      EXLYM could degrade mainly through four pathways: sulfur oxidation, nucleophilic 
      aromatic photosubstitution, C-S bond cleavage, and oxidative ring-opening. The 
      proposed degradation kinetics, TPs, and transformation pathways in aqueous 
      solutions provide valuable information on the fate of EXLYM in aquatic ecosystems 
      and lay the foundation for further toxicological tests.

TI  - Persistent organic pollutants and stable isotopes in biopsy samples (2004/2006) 
      from Southern Resident killer whales.
PG  - 1903-11
AB  - "Southern Resident" killer whales include three "pods" (J, K and L) that reside 
      primarily in Puget Sound/Georgia Basin during the spring, summer and fall. This 
      population was listed as "endangered" in the US and Canada following a 20% 
      decline between 1996 and 2001. The current study, using blubber/epidermis biopsy 
      samples, contributes contemporary information about potential factors (i.e., 
      levels of pollutants or changes in diet) that could adversely affect Southern 
      Residents. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes indicated J- and L-pod consumed 
      prey from similar trophic levels in 2004/2006 and also showed no evidence for a 
      large shift in the trophic level of prey consumed by L-pod between 1996 and 
      2004/2006. Sigma PCBs decreased for Southern Residents biopsied in 2004/2006 
      compared to 1993-1995. Surprisingly, however, a three-year-old male whale (J39) 
      had the highest concentrations of Sigma PBDEs, Sigma HCHs and HCB. POP ratio 
      differences between J- and L-pod suggested that they occupy different ranges in 
      winter.

TI  - Assessment of a delta15N isotopic method to indicate anthropogenic eutrophication 
      in aquatic ecosystems.
PG  - 124-32
AB  - Increased anthropogenic delivery of nutrients to water bodies, both freshwater 
      and estuarine, has caused detrimental changes in habitat, food web structure, and 
      nutrient cycling. Nitrogen-stable isotopes may be suitable indicators of such 
      increased nutrient delivery. In this study, we looked at the differences in 
      response of macrophyte delta15N values to anthropogenic N across different 
      taxonomic groups and geographic regions to test a stable isotopic method for 
      detecting anthropogenic impacts. Macrophyte delta15N values increased with 
      wastewater input and water-column dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) 
      concentration. When macrophytes were divided into macroalgae and plants, they 
      responded similarly to increases in wastewater N, although macroalgae was a more 
      reliable indicator of both wastewater inputs and water-column DIN concentrations. 
      Smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora Loisel.) Delta15N increased uniformly 
      with wastewater inputs across a geographic range. We used the relationship 
      derived between S. alterniflora and relative wastewater load to predict 
      wastewater loads in locations lacking quantitative land use data. The predictions 
      matched well with known qualitative information, proving the use of a stable 
      isotopic method for predicting wastewater input.

TI  - Endogeic earthworms shape bacterial functional communities and affect organic 
      matter mineralization in a tropical soil.
PG  - 213-22
LID - 10.1038/ismej.2011.87 [doi]
AB  - Priming effect (PE) is defined as a stimulation of the mineralization of soil 
      organic matter (SOM) following a supply of fresh organic matter. This process can 
      have important consequences on the fate of SOM and on the management of residues 
      in agricultural soils, especially in tropical regions where soil fertility is 
      essentially based on the management of organic matter. Earthworms are ecosystem 
      engineers known to affect the dynamics of SOM. Endogeic earthworms ingest large 
      amounts of soil and assimilate a part of organic matter it contains. During gut 
      transit, microorganisms are transported to new substrates and their activity is 
      stimulated by (i) the production of readily assimilable organic matter (mucus) 
      and (ii) the possible presence of fresh organic residues in the ingested soil. 
      The objective of our study was to see (i) whether earthworms impact the PE 
      intensity when a fresh residue is added to a tropical soil and (ii) whether this 
      impact is linked to a stimulation/inhibition of bacterial taxa, and which taxa 
      are affected. A tropical soil from Madagascar was incubated in the laboratory, 
      with a (13)C wheat straw residue, in the presence or absence of a peregrine 
      endogeic tropical earthworm, Pontoscolex corethrurus. Emissions of (12)CO(2) and 
      (13)CO(2) were followed during 16 days. The coupling between DNA-SIP (stable 
      isotope probing) and pyrosequencing showed that stimulation of both the 
      mineralization of wheat residues and the PE can be linked to the stimulation of 
      several groups especially belonging to the Bacteroidetes phylum.

TI  - Major decline in marine and terrestrial animal consumption by brown bears (Ursus 
      arctos).
PG  - 9203
LID - 10.1038/srep09203 [doi]
LID - 9203
AB  - Human activities have had the strongest impacts on natural ecosystems since the 
      last glacial period, including the alteration of interspecific relationships such 
      as food webs. In this paper, we present a historical record of major alterations 
      of trophic structure by revealing millennium-scale dietary shifts of brown bears 
      (Ursus arctos) on the Hokkaido islands, Japan, using carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur 
      stable isotope analysis. Dietary analysis of brown bears revealed that salmon 
      consumption by bears in the eastern region of Hokkaido significantly decreased 
      from 19% to 8%. In addition, consumption of terrestrial animals decreased from 
      56% to 5% in western region, and 64% to 8% in eastern region. These dietary 
      shifts are likely to have occurred in the last approximately 100-200 years, which 
      coincides with the beginning of modernisation in this region. Our results suggest 
      that human activities have caused an alteration in the trophic structure of brown 
      bears in the Hokkaido islands. This alteration includes a major decline in the 
      marine-terrestrial linkage in eastern region, and a loss of indirect-interactions 
      between bears and wolves, because the interactions potentially enhanced deer 
      predation by brown bears.

AB  - Food-chain models are used to predict radionuclide ingestion after fallout 
      deposition. These models include those transfer processes (soil-to-plant transfer 
      factor(s) [TF], plant-to-animal transfer coefficient(s) [TC] and concentration 
      ratio [CR]) that are likely to be important for radiological assessment. The 
      range of variability for transfer factors for the same plant groups is great, 
      about 4-5 orders of magnitude, which limits their applicability. A better way to 
      determine the best estimate the factors for radiocaesium and other important 
      radionuclides is if the site-specific data are available. Soil, plant and animal 
      samples were collected from a pasture area in Hungary during the vegetation 
      period in 2016. Stable (133)Cs concentration was analysed by comparative method 
      with neutron activation analysis (NAA). The comparator and the samples were 
      irradiated in thermal neutron flux 2.55 × 10(12) ncm(-2)s(-1) for 2 h (soil) and 
      6 h (vegetation, animal samples) in the TRIGA Mark II research reactor at the 
      Nuclear Engineering Teaching Laboratory. After an appropriate decay time (12 
      days) the samples were measured by gamma-spectrometry and analysed. The observed 
      stable caesium TC(pm) (0.48-0.53) and CR(pm) (0.41-0.45) were very close to 
      (137)Cs factors in the IAEA 2009 Report of 0.49 and 0.54, respectively. This 
      methodology is particularly suitable for the simultaneous study of natural 
      caesium in ecosystem compartments. Consequently, the transfer of stable caesium 
      in a pasture field may be regarded as a useful analogy in predicting the 
      long-term changes of (137)Cs affected by site-specific environmental factors.

PG  - 6528-32
AB  - New carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values for human remains dating to the 
      mid-Upper Paleolithic in Europe indicate significant amounts of aquatic (fish, 
      mollusks, and/or birds) foods in some of their diets. Most of this evidence 
      points to exploitation of inland freshwater aquatic resources in particular. By 
      contrast, European Neandertal collagen carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values 
      do not indicate significant use of inland aquatic foods but instead show that 
      they obtained the majority of their protein from terrestrial herbivores. In 
      agreement with recent zooarcheological analyses, the isotope results indicate 
      shifts toward a more broad-spectrum subsistence economy in inland Europe by the 
      mid-Upper Paleolithic period, probably associated with significant population 
      increases.

AB  - Food web structure regulates the pathways and flow rates of energy, nutrients, 
      and contaminants to top predators. Ecologically and physiologically meaningful 
      biochemical tracers provide a means to characterize and quantify these transfers 
      within food webs. In this study, changes in the ratios of stable N isotopes 
      (e.g., delta(15)N), fatty acids (FA), and persistent contaminants were used to 
      trace food web pathways utilized by herring gulls (Larus argentatus) breeding 
      along the shores of the St Lawrence River, Canada. Egg delta(15)N values varied 
      significantly among years and were used as an indicator of gull trophic position. 
      Temporal trends in egg delta(15)N values were related to egg FA profiles. In 
      years when egg delta(15)N values were greater, egg FA patterns reflected the 
      consumption of more aquatic prey. Egg delta(15)N values were also correlated with 
      annual estimates of prey fish abundance. These results indicated that temporal 
      changes in aquatic prey availability were reflected in the gull diet (as inferred 
      from ecological tracer profiles in gull eggs). Analysis of individual eggs within 
      years confirmed that birds consuming more aquatic prey occupied higher trophic 
      positions. Furthermore, increases in trophic position were associated with 
      increased concentrations of most persistent organic contaminants in eggs. 
      However, levels of highly brominated polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners, 
      e.g, 2,2',3,3',4,4',5,5',6,6'-decabromoDE (BDE-209), showed a negative 
      relationship with trophic position. These contrasting findings reflected 
      differences among contaminant groups/homologs in terms of their predominant 
      routes of transfer, i.e., aquatic versus terrestrial food webs. High trophic 
      level omnivores, e.g., herring gulls, are common in food webs. By characterizing 
      ecological tracer profiles in such species we can better understand spatial, 
      temporal, and individual differences in pathways of contaminant, energy, and 
      nutrient flow.

TI  - Using kinetic isotope effect to evaluate the significance of the sequential and

      methane oxidation coupled with sulfate reduction.
PG  - 2056-2067
LID - 10.2166/wst.2019.201 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe the dynamics of anaerobic oxidation of 
      methane (AOM) coupled with sulfate reduction (SR) using experimental data from a 
      continuous incubation experiments published earlier in order to show that 
      formation of consortia of anaerobic archaea (ANME) and Desulfosarcina-like 
      bacteria (DSS) may have a significant effect on sulfur isotope fractionation. The 
      dynamic simulation of reversible AOM by ANME coupled with SR by DSS was 
      performed. This simulation took into account biomass growth and fractionation of 
      stable isotopes of sulfur. Two kinetic schemes with and without ANME + DSS 
      consortium formation were tested. The respective models were applied at five 
      influent methane concentrations. A good fit to experimental data was obtained 
      only when assuming active ANME and DSS biomass accumulation. The assumption about 
      incorporation of reversibility of anaerobic methane oxidation and sulfate 
      reduction did not improve the model's fit to experimental data. In accordance 
      with both the models, sulfur isotope fractionation was smallest for the highest 
      influent methane concentration. The model considering the formation of consortia 
      of ANME + DSS is proved to be more appropriate.

TI  - The dark side of subsidies: adult stream insects export organic contaminants to 
      riparian predators.
PG  - 1835-41
AB  - Aquatic insects provide a critical energy subsidy to riparian food webs, yet 
      their role as vectors of contaminants to terrestrial ecosystems is poorly 
      understood. We investigated relationships between aquatic resource utilization 
      and contaminant exposure for a riparian invertivore assemblage (spiders and 
      herptiles) along a stream contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). 
      Stable carbon (delta13C) and nitrogen (delta15N) isotopes indicated that aquatic 
      insect utilization varied among predators, with progressive enrichment of 
      delta13C and depletion of delta15N as predators shifted from aquatic to 
      terrestrial prey. PCB concentrations significantly increased along these isotopic 
      gradients; delta13C and delta15N explained 65% and 15% of the variance in 
      predator sigmaPCBs, respectively. PCBs in predators were high, exceeding 2000 
      ng/g wet mass (the human-health advisory prohibiting any consumption of fish 
      tissue) in three species. Greater consideration should be given to streams as 
      lateral exporters rather than simply as longitudinal conduits for contaminants. 
      Persistent contaminants are underutilized for addressing landscape-level 
      questions in subsidy research, but our results demonstrate they are an ideal in 
      situ tracer of stream-derived energy because they label stream organic matter and 
      invertebrates over large distances. Likewise, riparian predators such as 
      tetragnathid spiders have great potential as biological monitors of stream 
      condition and as an assessment tool for risk management of contaminated aquatic 
      sediments.

AB  - Nowadays, pharmaceutical compounds (PC) are ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems. In 
      addition to direct ecotoxicity, the bioconcentration of PC in organisms is a 
      phenomenon which could have an impact on the whole ecosystem. In order to study 
      this phenomenon, we exposed unicellular algae (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) 
      to (15)N-tamoxifen, an anticancer drug labelled with a stable nitrogen isotope 
      used as a tracer. By measuring (15)N enrichment over time, we were able to 
      measure the increase of tamoxifen content in algae. This enrichment was measured 
      by an elemental analyser coupled with an isotopic ratio mass spectrometer 
      (EA-IRMS). Algal cells were exposed for 7d to 3 concentrations of tamoxifen: 1, 
      10 and 100μgL(-1). Our result shows a high bioconcentration in algae from the 
      first minutes of contact. The highest bioconcentration factor measured is around 
      26500. We also observe that bioconcentration is not linked to the exposure 
      concentration. This study is the first to use stable isotopes in order to monitor 
      PCs in aquatic organisms such as algae. The use of stable isotopes in 
      ecotoxicology offers interesting perspectives in the field of contaminant 
      transfer in organisms and along the trophic web.

TI  - Comparison of aquatic food chains using nitrogen isotopes.
PG  - 10844-7
AB  - Recent studies have shown the utility of delta(15)N to model trophic structure 
      and contaminant bioaccumulation in aquatic food webs. However, cross-system 
      comparisons in delta(15)N can be complicated by differences in delta(15)N at the 
      base of the food chain. Such baseline variation in delta(15)N is difficult to 
      resolve using plankton because of the large temporal variability in the 
      delta(15)N of small organisms that have fast nitrogen turnover. Comparisons using 
      large primary consumers, which have stable tissue isotopic signatures because of 
      their slower nitrogen turnover, show that delta(15)N increases markedly with the 
      human population density in the lake watershed. This shift in delta(15)N likely 
      reflects the high delta(15)N of human sewage. Correcting for this baseline 
      variation in delta(15)N, we report that, contrary to expectations based on 
      previous food-web analysis, the food chains leading up to fish varied by about 
      only one trophic level among the 40 lakes studied. Our results also suggest that 
      the delta(15)N signatures of nitrogen at the base of the food chain will provide 
      a useful tool in the assessment of anthropogenic nutrient inputs.

AB  - PCB levels in plankton were investigated in the Bay of Marseille, Western 
      Mediterranean Sea, between September 2010 and October 2011. Concentrations of PCB 
      congeners (CB 18, CB 52, CB 101, CB 118, CB 138, CB 153, CB 180) were determined 
      in three plankton size-classes (60-200, 200-500 and 500-1000μm) together with 
      different parameters: chlorophyll content, plankton dry-weight biomass, carbon 
      and nitrogen stable isotope ratios and plankton-community structure. The ∑PCB7 
      concentrations ranged between 14.2 and 88.1ngg(-1)d.w., for all size classes and 
      all sampling periods. The results do not show the biomass dilution effect and 
      indicate moderate but significant biomagnification with plankton trophic position 
      estimated by δ(15)N signatures. Equilibrium with water phase may notably 
      contribute in controlling the PCB levels in the plankton. More generally, 
      presented results imply that PCB accumulation in the plankton is an effect of 
      abiotic and trophic complex interactions in the Bay of Marseille.

AB  - Several studies demonstrated high mercury (Hg) methylation and demethylation in 
      the periphyton associated with floating roots in tropical ecosystems. The 
      importance of aquatic plants on methylmercury production in three temperate 
      ecosystems from south-western France was evaluated through Hg species 
      concentrations, and Hg methylation/demethylation activities by using stable 
      isotopic tracers ((199)Hg(II), Me(201)Hg). Hg accumulation and high methylation 
      and demethylation yields were detected in plant roots and periphyton, whereas 
      results for sediment and water were low to insignificant. The presence of sulfate 
      reducing prokaryotes was detected in all compartments (T-RFLP based on dsrAB 
      amplified through nested PCR) and their main role in Hg methylation could be 
      demonstrated. In turn, sulfate reduction inhibition did not affect demethylation 
      activities. The estimation of net MeHg budgets in these ecosystems suggested that 
      aquatic rhizosphere is the principal location for methylmercury production and 
      may represent an important source for the contamination of the aquatic food 
      chain.

AB  - The Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition around 35,000 years ago coincides 
      with the replacement of Neanderthals by anatomically modern humans in Europe. 
      Several hypotheses have been suggested to explain this replacement, one of them 
      being the ability of anatomically modern humans to broaden their dietary spectrum 
      beyond the large ungulate prey that Neanderthals consumed exclusively. This 
      scenario is notably based on higher nitrogen-15 amounts in early Upper 
      Palaeolithic anatomically modern human bone collagen compared with late 
      Neanderthals. In this paper, we document a clear increase of nitrogen-15 in bone 
      collagen of terrestrial herbivores during the early Aurignacian associated with 
      anatomically modern humans compared with the stratigraphically older 
      Châtelperronian and late Mousterian fauna associated with Neanderthals. 
      Carnivores such as wolves also exhibit a significant increase in nitrogen-15, 
      which is similar to that documented for early anatomically modern humans compared 
      with Neanderthals in Europe. A shift in nitrogen-15 at the base of the 
      terrestrial foodweb is responsible for such a pattern, with a preserved foodweb 
      structure before and after the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition in 
      south-western France. Such an isotopic shift in the terrestrial ecosystem may be 
      due to an increase in aridity during the time of deposition of the early 
      Aurignacian layers. If it occurred across Europe, such a shift in nitrogen-15 in 
      terrestrial foodwebs would be enough to explain the observed isotopic trend 
      between late Neanderthals and early anatomically modern humans, without any 
      significant change in the diet composition at the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic 
      transition.

TI  - Isotope variations in white-tailed kites from various habitats in California: 
      possible limitations in assessing prey utilization and population dynamics.
PG  - 159-67
AB  - White-tailed kite (Elanus leucurus) populations in the 1930s were close to 
      extirpation in the United States. But by the 1940s, an upward trend towards 
      recovery was apparent and continued to their current stable population levels. 
      These dramatic fluctuations in kite numbers may have been related to changes in 
      rodent prey populations due to the conversion of native habitats to agriculture. 
      To address this question, we evaluated the use of stable isotope analysis in 
      determining if a shift in diet could be isotopically differentiated in current 
      and historic kite populations. We first compared delta13C, delta15N, and delta34S 
      values from present-day kite flight feathers and prey fur samples from four 
      locations in California. The total ranges of isotope values for kite and their 
      rodent prey were similar within each site. Carbon isotope values ranged from 
      -27.1 to -22.2 per thousand in Arcata, -26.1 to -16.9 per thousand in Davis, 
      -27.0 to -15.0 per thousand in Cosumnes, and -28.2 to -11.6 per thousand in Santa 
      Barbara. Nitrogen isotope values ranged from 3.2 to 15.7 per thousand in Arcata, 
      2.8 to 12.7 per thousand in Davis, 4.0 to 15.7 per thousand in Cosumnes, and 1.7 
      to 20.0 per thousand in Santa Barbara. Sulfur isotope values ranged from -7.8 to 
      12.4 per thousand in Arcata, -1.1 to 9.2 per thousand in Davis, 0.7 to 10.9 per 
      thousand in Cosumnes, and -8.6 to 15.6 per thousand in Santa Barbara. Carbon, 
      nitrogen, and sulfur isotope values at each site reflect typical trophic 
      enrichments due to physiological processes. At each site, delta13C and delta15N 
      values reflected the influence of a predominantly C3 or a mixed C3/C4 plant

      terrestrial sulfur sources at each site. However, variability in isotope values 
      may limit the usefulness of such analyses for addressing prey utilization and

AB  - Though bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals has received attention in inland 
      waters, studies of pharmaceutical bioaccumulation in estuarine and marine systems 
      are limited. Further, an understanding of pharmaceutical bioaccumulation across 
      size classes of organisms displaying ontogenetic feeding shifts is lacking. We 
      selected the striped mullet, Mugil cephalus, a euryhaline and eurythermal species 
      that experiences dietary shifts with age, to identify whether a model base, 
      diphenhydramine, accumulated in a tidally influenced urban bayou. We further 
      determined whether diphenhydramine accumulation differed among size classes of 
      striped mullet over a two year study period. Stable isotope analysis identified 
      that ontogenetic feeding shifts of M. cephalus occurred from juveniles to adults. 
      However, bioaccumulation of diphenhydramine did not significantly increase across 
      age classes of M. cephalus but corresponded to surface water levels of the 
      pharmaceutical, which suggests inhalational uptake to diphenhydramine was more 
      important for bioaccumulation than dietary exposure in this urban estuary.

AB  - Nitrate content of surface waters results from complex mixing of multiple 
      sources, whose signatures can be modified through N reactions occurring within 
      the different compartments of the whole catchment. Despite this complexity, the 
      determination of nitrate origin is the first and crucial step for water resource 
      preservation. Here, for the first time, we combined at the catchment scale stable 
      isotopic tracers (δ(15)N and δ(18)O of nitrate and δ(11)B) and fecal indicators 
      to trace nitrate sources and pathways to the stream. We tested this approach on 
      two rivers in an agricultural region of SW France. Boron isotopic ratios 
      evidenced inflow from anthropogenic waters, microbiological markers revealed 
      organic contaminations from both human and animal wastes. Nitrate δ(15N) and 
      δ(18)O traced inputs from the surface leaching during high flow events and from 
      the subsurface drainage in base flow regime. They also showed that 
      denitrification occurred within the soils before reaching the rivers. 
      Furthermore, this study highlighted the determinant role of the soil compartment 
      in nitrate formation and recycling with important spatial heterogeneity and 
      temporal variability.

AB  - Nitrogen is the single most limiting factor for rice production. Detailed 
      knowledge on nitrogen dynamics in rice fields is therefore of major importance 
      for developing sustainable rice production. A combination of state-of-the-art 
      microsensor, stable isotope tracer, and molecular techniques was used to evaluate 
      coupled nitrification-denitrification potentials and community structure of 
      ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in a high yield irrigated rice cropping system in the 
      Philippines, without the use of microcosm incubations. The multiple approaches 
      showed a high degree of concordance among methods and thereby clarified the 
      investigated processes. Numbers and potential activity of ammonia-oxidizing 
      bacteria in the system reflected the availability of substrate in three defined 
      soil factions with a ranking of: surface soil > rhizosphere > bulk soil. No 
      nitrification activity was measured between spit applications of N fertilizer. 
      However, nitrification was induced upon nitrogen amendment in intact soil cores. 
      Despite induction by nitrogen amendment, the loss of nitrogen through coupled 
      nitrification-denitrification was less than 10% of the plant nitrogen uptake. 
      Denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis of amoA fragments revealed no differences 
      in diversity profiles between the soil fractions, and phylogenetic analysis, 
      based on amoA genes retrieved from the rice paddy soil, identified a set of 
      mutually very similar sequences related to Nitrosomonas nitrosa.

AB  - We conducted a one-year survey of macrozoobenthic community structure at 5 
      stations in a eutrophic canal in inner Tokyo Bay, focusing on the impacts of 
      hypoxia, sediment H2S, and species interaction in the littoral soft-bottom 
      habitats. Complete defaunation or decreasing density of less-tolerant taxa 
      occurred under hypoxia during warmer months, especially at subtidal or sulfidic 
      stations; this was followed by rapid recolonization by opportunistic polychaetes 
      in fall-winter. Sedimentary H2S increased the mortality of macroinvertebrates 
      under hypoxia or delayed population recovery during recolonization. The density 
      of several polychaetes (e.g., Pseudopolydora reticulata) declined in winter, 
      coincident with immigration of the predator Armandia lanceolata. This suggests 
      that absence of A. lanceolata under moderate hypoxia enabled the proliferation of 
      prey taxa. We conclude that oxygen concentration, sediment H2S, and 
      hypoxia-induced changes in species interactions are potential drivers for 
      spatiotemporal changes in macrozoobenthic assemblage structure in hypoxia-prone 
      soft-bottom communities.

AB  - We added the stable isotope (15)N in the form of ((15)NH4)2SO4 and K(15)NO3 to 
      forest ecosystems in eastern China under two different N deposition levels to 
      study the fate of the different forms of deposited N. Prior to the addition of 
      the (15)N tracers, the natural (15)N abundance ranging from -3.4‰ to +10.9‰ in 
      the forest under heavy N deposition at Dinghushan (DHS), and from -3.92‰ to 
      +7.25‰ in the forest under light N deposition at Daxinganling (DXAL). Four months 
      after the tracer application, the total (15)N recovery from the major ecosystem 
      compartments ranged from 55.3% to 90.5%. The total (15)N recoveries were similar 
      under the ((15)NH4)2SO4 tracer treatment in both two forest ecosystems, whereas 
      the total (15)N recovery was significantly lower in the subtropical forest 
      ecosystem at DHS than in the boreal forest ecosystem at DXAL under the K(15)NO3 
      tracer treatment. The (15)N assimilated into the tree biomass represented only 
      8.8% to 33.7% of the (15)N added to the forest ecosystems. In both of the tracer 
      application treatments, more (15)N was recovered from the tree biomass in the 
      subtropical forest ecosystem at DHS than the boreal forest ecosystem at DXAL. The 
      amount of (15)N assimilated into tree biomass was greater under the K(15)NO3 
      tracer treatment than that of the ((15)NH4)2SO4 treatment in both forest 
      ecosystems. This study suggests that, although less N was immobilized in the 
      forest ecosystems under more intensive N deposition conditions, forest ecosystems 
      in China strongly retain N deposition, even in areas under heavy N deposition 
      intensity or in ecosystems undergoing spring freezing and thawing melts. Compared 
      to ammonium deposition, deposited nitrate is released from the forest ecosystem 
      more easily. However, nitrate deposition could be retained mostly in the plant N 
      pool, which might lead to more C sequestration in these ecosystems.

TI  - The impacts of ontogenetic dietary shifts in yellow perch (Perca flavescens) on 
      Zn and Hg accumulation.
PG  - 246-52
LID - 10.1016/j.ecoenv.2011.11.033 [doi]
AB  - Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) undergo several ontogenetic dietary shifts, and 
      consequently these fish feed at different trophic levels and rely on different 
      carbon sources over their lifetime. Stable isotope ratios of nitrogen (δ(15)N) 
      and carbon (δ(13)C) are powerful ecological tools that are used to provide a 
      temporally integrated description of the feeding ecology of aquatic animals such 
      as fish. The main objective of this study was to use stable isotopes of nitrogen 
      and carbon to determine if dietary changes affected mercury (Hg) and zinc (Zn) 
      accumulation in yellow perch ranging in size from approximately 5 cm to 27 cm. 
      Results showed that Hg bioaccumulation generally increased with increasing 
      trophic level in fish feeding at higher trophic levels, however, the relationship 
      between Hg levels and δ(15)N was non-linear showing no relationship in small fish 
      (less than 15 cm). In contrast, there was a negative, linear relationship between 
      δ(15)N and Zn, suggesting that as perch fed at progressively higher trophic 
      levels, less of Zn bioaccumulated. No relationship was observed between δ(13)C 
      and metal levels in perch. Collectively, these results demonstrate a contrast in 
      the behavior of Zn and Hg bioaccumulation in yellow perch as a function of 
      trophic status.

TI  - Mercury concentrations in Southern Beaufort Sea polar bears: variation based on 
      stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen.
PG  - 1416-24
LID - 10.1897/08-557.1 [doi]
AB  - Total Hg concentration was measured in hair and whole blood of 52 adult Southern 
      Beaufort Sea polar bears (Ursus maritimus) captured in the spring of 2005. Stable 
      isotopic signatures (i.e., 13C/12C, delta13C; 15N/14N, delta15N) in hair and two 
      blood compartments (packed blood cells/clot and serum) were determined to assess 
      the variation of Hg concentrations among polar bears in relation to their feeding 
      ecology and other biological factors. Concentrations of Hg in hair and blood 
      (2.2-23.9 microg/g dry wt and 0.007-0.213 microg/g wet wt, respectively) were 
      within the range of values previously reported for polar bears in Canada and East 
      Greenland. Mercury concentration in hair from females was higher than that in 
      hair from males, and concentration was related to interactions between delta13C, 
      delta15N, and longitude of capture location. Mercury concentrations in hair were 
      inversely correlated to delta13C in hair and blood, suggesting that polar bears 
      with greater total Hg concentrations fed more on pelagic prey, such as ringed 
      seals or beluga whale, than on benthic prey. Variability in Hg concentrations in 
      polar bear hair and blood may be the result of intraspecific or regional 
      variation in prey selection rather than strictly trophic level interactions.

TI  - Pleistocene to historic shifts in bald eagle diets on the Channel Islands, 
      California.
PG  - 9246-51
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0913011107 [doi]
AB  - Studies of current interactions among species, their prey, and environmental 
      factors are essential for mitigating immediate threats to population viability, 
      but the true range of behavioral and ecological flexibility can be determined 
      only through research on deeper timescales. Ecological data spanning centuries to 
      millennia provide important contextual information for long-term management 
      strategies, especially for species that now are living in relict populations. 
      Here we use a variety of methods to reconstruct bald eagle diets and local 
      abundance of their potential prey on the Channel Islands from the late 
      Pleistocene to the time when the last breeding pairs disappeared from the islands 
      in the mid-20th century. Faunal and isotopic analysis of bald eagles shows that 
      seabirds were important prey for immature/adult eagles for millennia before the 
      eagles' local extirpation. In historic times (A.D. 1850-1950), however, isotopic 
      and faunal data show that breeding bald eagles provisioned their chicks with 
      introduced ungulates (e.g., sheep), which were locally present in high densities. 
      Today, bald eagles are the focus of an extensive conservation program designed to 
      restore a stable breeding population to the Channel Islands, but native and 
      nonnative prey sources that were important for bald eagles in the past are either 
      diminished (e.g., seabirds) or have been eradicated (e.g., introduced ungulates). 
      In the absence of sufficient resources, a growing bald eagle population on the 
      Channel Islands could expand its prey base to include carrion from local pinniped 
      colonies, exert predation pressure on a recovering seabird population, and 
      possibly prey on endangered island foxes.

TI  - Tracing waterbird exposure to total mercury and selenium: a case study at the 
      solar saltworks of Thyna (sfax, Tunisia).
PG  - 5118-24
LID - 10.1021/es200026w [doi]
AB  - Saltworks have emerged as important alternative/complementary feeding habitats 
      for avifauna. However, the consequences of such habitat shifts in terms of 
      changes in exposure to contaminants are poorly understood. We evaluated the 
      exposure of the waterbird community breeding at the saltworks of Thyna (Tunisia) 
      to total Hg (THg) and Se according to their differential use of saltworks dietary 
      resources, as revealed by δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N values in their eggs (included species 
      [n] -sorted according to increasing reliance on saltworks resources: 
      Yellow-legged Gull Larus michahellis [12], Common Tern Sterna hirundo [12], 
      Slender-billed Gull Larus genei [15], Little Egret Egretta garzetta [20], and 
      Pied Avocet Recurvirostra avosetta [22]). Concentrations of THg and Se were under 
      the threshold points for deleterious effects. Egg THg concentrations 
      significantly decreased as the dietary contribution of saltworks resources 
      increased (mean: 3.23, 1.66, 0.76, 0.4, and 0.27 μg/g dw, respectively). 
      Conversely, egg Se concentrations did not vary according to foraging habitats 
      (2.49, 2.96, 2.61, 3.27, and 1.5 μg/g dw, respectively). Tracing waterbird 
      exposure to THg and Se at saltworks was feasible through the use stable isotopic 
      assays of eggs. Birds using saltworks are not exposed to higher concentrations of 
      THg and Se than in adjacent marine habitats.

AB  - This study is the first comprehensive evaluation of total Hg and methylmercury 
      (MeHg) concentrations in wild marine fish from an estuarine and a coastal 
      ecosystem in southern China. A total of 571 fish from 54 different species were 
      examined. Our results showed that the Hg levels were generally low in the fish, 
      and the Hg levels were below 30 ng g(-1) (wet weight) for 82% of the samples, 
      which may be related to the reduced size of the fish and altered food web 
      structure due to overfishing. Decreased coastal wetland coverage and different 
      carbon sources may be responsible for the habitat-specific Hg concentrations. The 
      degree of biomagnification was relatively low in the two systems.

AB  - Considered as one of the most available radionuclide in soil-plant system, ³⁶Cl 
      is of potential concern for long-term management of radioactive wastes, due to 
      its high mobility and its long half-life. To evaluate the risk of dispersion and 
      accumulation of ³⁶Cl in the biosphere as a consequence of a potential 
      contamination, there is a need for an appropriate understanding of the chlorine 
      cycling dynamics in the ecosystems. To date, a small number of studies have 
      investigated the chlorine transfer in the ecosystem including the transformation 
      of chloride to organic chlorine but, to our knowledge, none have modelled this 
      cycle. In this study, a model involving inorganic as well as organic pools in 
      soils has been developed and parameterised to describe the biogeochemical fate of 
      chlorine in a pine forest. The model has been evaluated for stable chlorine by 
      performing a range of sensitivity analyses and by comparing the simulated to the 
      observed values. Finally a range of contamination scenarios, which differ in 
      terms of external supply, exposure time and source, has been simulated to 
      estimate the possible accumulation of ³⁶Cl within the different compartments of 
      the coniferous stand. The sensitivity study supports the relevancy of the model 
      and its compartments, and has highlighted the chlorine transfers affecting the 
      most the residence time of chlorine in the stand. Compared to observations, the 
      model simulates realistic values for the chlorine content within the different 
      forest compartments. For both atmospheric and underground contamination scenarios 
      most of the chlorine can be found in its organic form in the soil. However, in 
      case of an underground source, about two times less chlorine accumulates in the 
      system and proportionally more chlorine leaves the system through drainage than 
      through volatilisation.

AB  - Environmental fate of fish farm wastes (FFW) released from an open-sea-cage farm 
      at Kat O, Hong Kong was examined by measuring carbon and nitrogen stable isotope 
      (SI) ratios in selected benthic organisms collected along a 2000 m transect from 
      the farm. Our results showed that FFW significantly influenced the energy 
      utilization profile of consumers near the fish farm. Although nitrogen enrichment 
      effect on δ15N was anticipated in biota near the farm, the predicted patterns did 
      not consistently occur in all feeding guilds. Two species of suspension-feeders, 
      which relied on naturally δ15N-depleted sources, were δ15N-enriched near the fish 
      farm. In contrast, both species of benthic grazer and deposit-feeder, which 
      relied on naturally δ15N-enriched algal sources, were δ15N-depleted under the 
      influence of FFW. The SI signatures of biota can, therefore, serve as feasible 
      biomarkers for FFW discharges only when the trophic structure of the receiving 
      environment is fully elucidated.

AB  - The role of a yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) small colony in conveying 
      trace elements (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, THg, V, Zn) was assessed in a 
      Mediterranean nature reserve (Marinello ponds) at various spatial and temporal 
      scales. Trace element concentrations in guano were high and seasonally variable. 
      In contrast, contamination in the ponds was not influenced by season but showed 
      strong spatial variability among ponds, according to the different guano input. 
      Biogenic enrichment factor B confirmed the role of gulls in the release of trace 
      elements through guano subsidies. In addition, comparing trace element pond 
      concentrations to the US NOAA's SQGs, As, Cu and Ni showed contamination levels 
      associated with possible negative biological effects. Thus, this study reflects 
      the need to take seabirds into account as key factors influencing ecological 
      processes and contamination levels even in remote areas, especially around the 
      Mediterranean, where these birds are abundant but overlooked.

PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1016/j.ecoenv.2012.03.014 [doi]
AB  - Mussels, Diplon chilensis, from Lake Moreno, a double-basined mountain lake in 
      southern Argentina, is known to have elevated concentrations of chromium (Cr, > 
      25 μg g⁻¹ dry weight DW) and arsenic (As, 35 μg g⁻¹ DW), attributed to untreated 
      sewage. To further understand the trophodynamics of Cr, As and cobalt (Co), we 
      investigated concentrations and transfer throughout the food web in each basin of 
      Lake Moreno. Each basin differs in morphology in that the gently-sloping Lake 
      Moreno West has more littoral habitat than deeper Lake Moreno East with its 
      higher proportion of pelagic habitat. Despite the morphological differences, both 
      basins share similar water quality parameters and species assemblages. As a 
      result, Lake Moreno provides an exceptional opportunity to compare trophodynamics 
      of elements that enable us to hypothesize pelagic-littoral habitat coupling in 
      response to lake morphology as the underlying factor influencing both Cr pathway 
      and Co and As trophodynamic modeling. Using stable isotopes of nitrogen (δ¹⁵N) 
      and carbon (δ¹³C) to characterize metals trophodynamics in each basin, 
      biodilution of As, Cr and Co were indicated by negative regressions. This is 
      confirmed by elevated As, Co and Cr concentrations in phytoplankton (11.3±5.7, 
      7.4±4.9, 44.5±40.7 μg g⁻¹ DW respectively), while zooplankton and biofilm had the 
      next elevated concentrations. Those elevated concentrations are in contrast with 
      lower concentrations in sport fish such as rainbow trout (0.5±0.5, 0.2±0.3, 
      1.8±1.2 μg g⁻¹ DW). Higher concentrations of Cr in fish were associated with 
      higher proportion of benthic/littoral prey items in western basin, and were 
      confirmed by significant correlation with δ¹³C values. Arsenic, Co and Cr 
      concentrations in fish, while elevated, do not post health risks to human or 
      wildlife consumers.

TI  - Population dynamics and resource availability drive seasonal shifts in the 
      consumptive and competitive impacts of introduced house mice (Mus musculus) on an 
      island ecosystem.
PG  - e13904
LID - 10.7717/peerj.13904 [doi]
LID - e13904
AB  - BACKGROUND: House mice (Mus musculus) are widespread and invasive on many islands 
      where they can have both direct and indirect impacts on native ecological 
      communities. Given their opportunistic, omnivorous nature the consumptive and 
      competitive impacts of house mice on islands have the potential to vary over time 
      in concert with resource availability and mouse population dynamics. METHODS: We 
      examined the ecological niche of invasive house mice on Southeast Farallon 
      Island, California, USA using a combination of mouse trapping, food resource 
      surveys, and stable isotope analysis to better understand their trophic 
      interactions with native flora and fauna. Specifically, we coupled the analysis 
      of seasonal variation in resource availability over a 17-year period (2001-2017), 
      carbon (δ (13)C) and nitrogen (δ (15)N) stable isotope values of mouse tissue and 
      prey resources in a single year (2013), and isotopic niche and mixing models to 
      quantify seasonal variation in mouse diets and the potential for resource overlap 
      with native species. RESULTS: We found that plants were the most important 
      resource for house mice during the spring months when vegetation is abundant and 
      mouse populations are low following heavy precipitation and declines in mouse 
      abundance during the winter. While still consumed, plants declined in dietary 
      importance throughout the summer and fall as mouse populations increased, and 
      seabird and arthropod resources became relatively more available and consumed by 
      house mice. Mouse abundance peaks and other resource availability are low on the 
      island in the fall months when the isotopic niches of house mice and salamanders 
      overlap significantly indicating the potential for competition, most likely for 
      arthropod prey. DISCUSSION: Our results indicate how seasonal shifts in both 
      mouse abundance and resource availability are key factors that mediate the 
      consumptive and competitive impacts of introduced house mice on this island 
      ecosystem. As mice consume and/or compete with a wide range of native taxa, 
      eradication has the potential to provide wide-reaching restoration benefits on 
      Southeast Farallon Island. Post-eradication monitoring focused on plant, 
      terrestrial invertebrate, salamander, and seabird populations will be crucial to 
      confirm these predictions.

AB  - Following the release of the international regulations on PBDEs and HBCD, the aim 
      of this study is to evaluate the concentrations of novel brominated flame 
      retardants (NBFRs), including 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy) ethane (BTBPE), 
      decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE), hexabromobenzene (HBB), and 
      pentabromoethylbenzene (PBEB), in an Italian subalpine lake located in a 
      populated and industrial area. The study investigated specifically the potential 
      BFR biomagnification in a particular lake's pelagic food web, whose structure and 
      dynamics were evaluated using the Stable Isotope Analysis. The potential BFR 
      biomagnification was investigated by using the trophic-level adjusted BMFs and 
      Trophic Magnification Factors (TMFs), confirming that HBCD and some PBDE 
      congeners are able to biomagnify within food webs. Comparing the calculated 
      values of BMFTL and TMF, a significant positive correlation was observed between 
      the two factors, suggesting that the use of BMFTL to investigate the 
      biomagnification potential of organic chemical compounds might be an appropriate 
      approach when a simple food web is considered.

TI  - Characterizing the Movement of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in an Avian 
      Aquatic-Terrestrial Food Web.
PG  - 20249-20260
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.3c06944 [doi]
AB  - The movement of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) through linked 
      aquatic-terrestrial food webs is not well understood. Tree swallows (Tachycineta 
      bicolor) in such systems may be exposed to PFAS from multiple abiotic and/or 
      biotic compartments. We show from fatty acid signatures and carbon stable 
      isotopes that tree swallow nestlings in southwestern Ontario fed on both 
      terrestrial and aquatic macroinvertebrates. The PFAS profiles of air, terrestrial 
      invertebrates, and swallows were dominated by perfluorooctanesulfonic acid 
      (PFOS). Short-chain perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) were largely restricted to air, 
      surface water, and sediment, and long-chain PFAAs were mainly found in aquatic 
      invertebrates and tree swallows. PFOS, multiple long-chain perfluorocarboxylic 
      acids [perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), 
      perfluorotridecanoic acid (PFTrDA)] and perfluorooctane sulfonamide precursors 
      were estimated to bioaccumulate from air to tree swallows. PFOS bioaccumulated 
      from air to terrestrial invertebrates, and PFOS, PFDA, and perfluorooctane 
      sulfonamidoacetic acids (FOSAAs) bioaccumulated from water to aquatic 
      invertebrates. PFOS showed biomagnification from both terrestrial and aquatic 
      invertebrates to tree swallows, and PFDA and FOSAAs were also biomagnified from 
      aquatic invertebrates to tree swallows. The movement of PFAS through 
      aquatic-terrestrial food webs appears congener- and compartment-specific, 
      challenging the understanding of PFAS exposure routes for multiple species 
      involved in these food webs.

TI  - δ13C and δ15N values in scales of Micropterus salmoides largemouth bass as a 
      freshwater environmental indicator.
PG  - 17-24
LID - 10.1002/rcm.5288 [doi]
AB  - We have investigated the effectiveness of using the Micropterus salmoides 
      largemouth bass, which is a top predator found throughout the world, as the index 
      of a hydrosphere environment and its food chain. To this end, we used stable 
      carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis (SIA). Largemouth bass were collected from 
      eight dam reservoirs and two ponds in Toyama Prefecture, Japan. Toyama is located 
      in central Japan and features a variety of distinct geographical environments, a 
      result of the 3000-m elevation that changes over short distances, and abundant 
      water systems. The mean δ(13)C and δ(15)N values for the lipid-extracted muscle 
      of largemouth bass from all sampling locations showed large variability, but 
      there were only small standard deviations at each sampling location. The isotope 
      ratios for largemouth bass express the characteristics of each investigated 
      hydrosphere environment and food chain. A very high correlation (δ(13)C: Y(scale) 
      = 0.96 X(muscle) + 1.58, R(2) = 0.98, δ(15)N: Y(scale) = 0.92 X(muscle) - 1.15, 
      R(2) = 0.95) of SIA values was found between largemouth bass scales and 
      lipid-extracted muscles, which suggests that the more easily analyzed scales are 
      useful as SIA samples for the monitoring and comparison of hydrosphere 
      environments throughout the world.

TI  - Hippos (Hippopotamus amphibius): The animal silicon pump.
PG  - eaav0395
LID - 10.1126/sciadv.aav0395 [doi]
LID - eaav0395
AB  - While the importance of grasslands in terrestrial silicon (Si) cycling and fluxes 
      to rivers is established, the influence of large grazers has not been considered. 
      Here, we show that hippopotamuses are key actors in the savannah biogeochemical 
      Si cycle. Through a detailed analysis of Si concentrations and stable isotope 
      compositions in multiple ecosystem compartments of a savannah-river continuum, we 
      constrain the processes influencing the Si flux. Hippos transport 0.4 metric tons 
      of Si day(-1) by foraging grass on land and directly egesting in the water. As 
      such, they bypass complex retention processes in secondary soil Si pools. By 
      balancing internal processes of dissolution and precipitation in the river 
      sediment, we calculate that hippos affect up to 76% of the total Si flux. This 
      can have a large impact on downstream lake ecosystems, where Si availability 
      directly affects primary production in the diatom-dominated phytoplankton 
      communities.

TI  - Bacteria rather than Archaea dominate microbial ammonia oxidation in an 
      agricultural soil.
PG  - 1658-71
LID - 10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.01891.x [doi]
AB  - Agricultural ecosystems annually receive approximately 25% of the global nitrogen 
      input, much of which is oxidized at least once by ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotes 
      to complete the nitrogen cycle. Recent discoveries have expanded the known 
      ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotes from the domain Bacteria to Archaea. However, in 
      the complex soil environment it remains unclear whether ammonia oxidation is 
      exclusively or predominantly linked to Archaea as implied by their exceptionally 
      high abundance. Here we show that Bacteria rather than Archaea functionally 
      dominate ammonia oxidation in an agricultural soil, despite the fact that 
      archaeal versus bacterial amoA genes are numerically more dominant. In soil 
      microcosms, in which ammonia oxidation was stimulated by ammonium and inhibited 
      by acetylene, activity change was paralleled by abundance change of bacterial but 
      not of archaeal amoA gene copy numbers. Molecular fingerprinting of amoA genes 
      also coupled ammonia oxidation activity with bacterial but not archaeal amoA gene 
      patterns. DNA-stable isotope probing demonstrated CO(2) assimilation by Bacteria 
      rather than Archaea. Our results indicate that Archaea were not important for 
      ammonia oxidation in the agricultural soil tested.

AB  - Invasive predators can profoundly impact native communities, especially in 
      insular ecosystems where functionally equivalent predators were evolutionarily 
      absent. Beyond direct consumption, predators can affect communities indirectly by 
      creating or altering food web linkages among existing species. Where invasive 
      predators consume prey from multiple distinct resource channels, novel links may 
      couple the dynamics of disjunct modules and create indirect interactions between 
      them. Our study focuses on invasive populations of Eleutherodactylus coqui 
      (Anura: Leptodactylidae) on Hawaii Island. Coqui actively forage in the 
      understory and lower canopy at night but return to the forest floor and 
      belowground retreats by day. Recent dietary studies using gut contents and 
      naturally occurring stable isotopes indicate higher than expected consumption of 
      litter arthropods, which in these Hawaiian forests are primarily non-native 
      species. We used laboratory studies to observe diurnal and nocturnal foraging 
      behavior, and experimental field additions of C4 vegetation as a litter tracer to 
      distinguish epigaeic sources from food web pools in the C3 canopy. Lab trials 
      revealed that prey consumption during diurnal foraging was half that consumed 
      during nocturnal foraging. Analysis of δ13C isotopes showed incorporation of C4 
      carbon into litter arthropods within one month, and Bayesian mixing models 
      estimated that 15-25% of the carbon in coqui tissue was derived from litter 
      sources. These results support recent findings that E. coqui are not quiescent 
      diurnally but instead actively forage. Such activity by a mobile invasive 
      predator may introduce a novel linkage that integrates detrital and foliar 
      resource pools, potentially distributing influences of invasive litter arthropods 
      through the broader system to amplify impacts on native species.

AB  - Anthropogenic food subsidies, such as refuse, are an important driver of animal 
      population changes and gulls heavily forage on this food source. Foraging on 
      refuse during the rearing period could affect the acquisition of resources with 
      potential demographic consequences. Using conventional diet analysis and stable 
      isotopes of δ(13)C and δ(15)N of blood of Kelp Gull (Larus dominicanus) 
      nestlings, we studied the variation of the chick growth in response to foraging 
      on refuse on a reproductive colony in the Rio de la Plata Estuary in Uruguay. 
      Using Bayesian mixing models on isotopic data, we estimated the proportion and 
      variation of natural food and refuse in the diet of nestlings. Then, we modelled 
      the variation between the mean posterior densities of the food sources and their 
      standard deviation with the nestling morphometric measurements of different 
      sizes. We found that refuse was gradually delivered to Kelp Gull nestlings during 
      the chick rearing period. Additionally, variation of refuse incorporated into 
      nestling tissues increased with nestlings' size. We propose that parents use more 
      isotopically unique food sources during the nestling growth thereby increasing 
      isotopic diversity. This study highlights the need to improve the current waste 
      management system, which is being reviewed in Uruguay. We believe that decision 
      makers should consider the results of this study, which show that refuse is 
      directly impacting coastal ecosystems through mechanisms poorly explored by the 
      environmental sciences.

TI  - Trophic ecology of the invasive argentine ant: spatio-temporal variation in 
      resource assimilation and isotopic enrichment.
PG  - 763-71
LID - 10.1007/s00442-010-1694-1 [doi]
AB  - Studies of food webs often employ stable isotopic approaches to infer trophic 
      position and interaction strength without consideration of spatio-temporal 
      variation in resource assimilation by constituent species. Using results from 
      laboratory diet manipulations and monthly sampling of field populations, we 
      illustrate how nitrogen isotopes may be used to quantify spatio-temporal 
      variation in resource assimilation in ants. First, we determined nitrogen 
      enrichment using a controlled laboratory experiment with the invasive Argentine 
      ant (Linepithema humile). After 12 weeks, worker δ(15)N values from colonies fed 
      an animal-based diet had δ(15)N values that were 5.51% greater compared to 
      colonies fed a plant-based diet. The shift in δ(15)N values in response to the 
      experimental diet occurred within 10 weeks. We next reared Argentine ant colonies 
      with or without access to honeydew-producing aphids and found that after 8 weeks 
      workers from colonies without access to aphids had δ(15)N values that were 6.31% 
      larger compared to colonies with access to honeydew. Second, we sampled field 
      populations over a 1-year period to quantify spatio-temporal variability in 
      isotopic ratios of L. humile and those of a common native ant (Solenopsis 
      xyloni). Samples from free-living colonies revealed that fluctuations in δ(15)N 
      were 1.6-2.4‰ for L. humile and 1.8-2.9‰ for S. xyloni. Variation was also 
      detected among L. humile castes: time averaged means of δ(15)N varied from 1.2 to 
      2.5‰ depending on the site, with δ(15)N values for queens ≥ workers > brood. The 
      estimated trophic positions of L. humile and S. xyloni were similar within a 
      site; however, trophic position for each species differed significantly at larger 
      spatial scales. While stable isotopes are clearly useful for examining the 
      trophic ecology of arthropod communities, our results suggest that caution is 
      warranted when making ecological interpretations when stable isotope collections 
      come from single time periods or life stages.

AB  - Seasonal fluctuations in mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and 
      selenium (Se) concentrations were studied in black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa 
      tridactyla) from Kongsfjorden, Svalbard (79°57'N, 12°12'E). Element 
      concentrations were determined in muscle and liver tissue in kittiwakes collected 
      in May, July and October 2007. Stable isotopes of carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen 
      (δ(15)N) were analysed in muscle tissue to calculate trophic position (TP) and 
      examine the possible influence of carbon source on element accumulation. 
      Metallothionein (MT) concentrations in liver, as well as Hg and Cd concentration 
      in size-fractionated liver supernatant were determined to evaluate the 
      association between elements and MT. Mercury concentrations declined from May 
      through July to October in both tissues, while concentrations of Cd were similar 
      in May and July and lower in October. A decline in TP between May and July, 
      indicating a shift from fish-based diet towards an invertebrate-based diet 
      explains the declining Hg concentration. The low Hg and Cd concentrations in 
      October may be a result of an increased elimination, probably related to 
      moulting. Selenium decreased in the same manner as Hg in liver and muscle, 
      possibly related to the formation of Se-Hg complexes. Zinc and Cu did not 
      fluctuate in muscle tissue, whereas hepatic Zn concentrations where highest in 
      May. Hepatic Zn concentrations were higher in females compared to males in May, 
      possibly related to egg production. Hepatic MT concentrations were lower in 
      October compared to July, following the same trend as Hg and Cd. Cadmium was 
      predominantly bound to the MT fraction of proteins in liver tissue, whereas Hg 
      was associated with the larger proteins, indicating that MT was not sequestering 
      Hg in the kittiwakes.

AB  - Largemouth (LMB: Micropterus salmoides) and Smallmouth Bass (SMB: Micropterus 
      dolomieu) are important species in the recreational fisheries of the Laurentian 
      Great Lakes. The invasion of the Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) into these 
      lakes has changed several facets of black bass biology, but there is still much 
      to learn about the relationship between these species. Previous dietary analyses 
      have shown Round Goby to be important prey for bass, but have been limited by low 
      visual identification rates of dissected stomach items. Within the present study, 
      DNA barcoding and stable isotope analysis improve prey identification and provide 
      a more quantitative dietary analysis of adult black bass in Lake Ontario, 
      comparing the importance of Round Goby as prey between these two species. 
      Eighty-four LMB (406mm fork length ±4mm SEM) and two hundred sixty-four SMB 
      (422mm ±2mm) obtained as tournament mortalities had prey identified using 
      DNA-based methods. Round Goby was the most prevalent prey species for both 
      predators. The diet of LMB was three times more diverse than that of SMB, which 
      almost entirely consists of Round Goby. Our results provide further support that 
      recent increases in the size of Lake Ontario bass are a result of Round Goby 
      consumption, and that the effects of this dietary shift on body condition are 
      greater for SMB. Techniques developed in this study include reverse-oriented dual 
      priming oligonucleotides used as blocking primers for predator DNA, and an 
      automated design approach of restriction fragment length polymorphism tests for 
      identifying prey DNA barcodes.

TI  - Divergence of feeding channels within the soil food web determined by ecosystem 
      type.
PG  - 1-13

AB  - Understanding trophic linkages within the soil food web (SFW) is hampered by its 
      opacity, diversity, and limited niche adaptation. We need to expand our insight 
      between the feeding guilds of fauna and not just count biodiversity. The soil 
      fauna drive nutrient cycling and play a pivotal, but little understood role 
      within both the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles that may be ecosystem 
      dependent. Here, we define the structure of the SFW in two habitats (grassland 
      and woodland) on the same soil type and test the hypothesis that land management 
      would alter the SFW in these habitats. To do this, we census the community 
      structure and use stable isotope analysis to establish the pathway of C and N 
      through each trophic level within the ecosystems. Stable isotope ratios of C and 
      N from all invertebrates were used as a proxy for trophic niche, and 
      community-wide metrics were obtained. Our empirically derived C/N ratios differed 
      from those previously reported, diverging from model predictions of global C and 
      N cycling, which was unexpected. An assessment of the relative response of the 
      different functional groups to the change from agricultural grassland to woodland 
      was performed. This showed that abundance of herbivores, microbivores, and 
      micropredators were stimulated, while omnivores and macropredators were inhibited 
      in the grassland. Differences between stable isotope ratios and community-wide 
      metrics, highlighted habitats with similar taxa had different SFWs, using 
      different basal resources, either driven by root or litter derived resources. 
      Overall, we conclude that plant type can act as a top-down driver of community 
      functioning and that differing land management can impact on the whole SFW.

TI  - Dual-tracer-based isotope turnover rates in a highly invasive mysid Limnomysis 
      benedeni from Lake Constance.
PG  - 4173-4178
LID - 10.1002/ece3.2928 [doi]
AB  - Understanding the ecological patterns of invasive species and their habitats 
      require an understanding of the species' foraging ecology. Stable carbon (δ(13)C) 
      and nitrogen (δ(15)N) isotope values provide useful information into the study of 
      animal ecology and evolution, since the isotope ratios of consumers reflect 
      consumer's dietary patterns. Nevertheless, the lack of species- and 
      element-specific laboratory-derived turnover rates could limit their application. 
      Using a laboratory-based dual stable isotope tracer approach (Na(15) NO (3) and 
      NaH(13) CO (3)), we evaluated the δ(15)N and δ(13)C isotope turnover rates in 
      full-grown adult invasive Limnomysis benedeni from Lake Constance. We provide 
      δ(15)N and δ(13)C turnover rates based on nonlinear least-squares regression and 
      posterior linear regression models. Model precisions and fit were evaluated using 
      Akaike's information criterion. Within a couple of days, the δ(15)N and δ(13)C of 
      mysids began to change. Nevertheless, after about 14 days, L. benedeni did not 
      reach equilibrium with their new isotope values. Since the experiment was 
      conducted on adult subjects, it is evident that turnover was mainly influenced by 
      metabolism (in contrast to growth). Unlike traditional dietary shifts, our 
      laboratory-based dual stable isotope tracer approach does not shift the 
      experimental organisms into a new diet and avoids dietary effects on isotope 
      values. Results confirm the application of isotopic tracers to label mysid 
      subpopulations and could be used to reflect assimilation and turnover from the 
      labeled dietary sources. Field-based stable isotope studies often use isotopic 
      mixing models commonly assuming diet-tissue steady state. Unfortunately, in cases 
      where the isotopic composition of the animal is not in equilibrium with its diet, 
      this can lead to highly misleading conclusions. Thus, our laboratory-based 
      isotopic incorporation rates assist interpretation of the isotopic values from 
      the field and provide a foundation for future research into using isotopic 
      tracers to investigate invasion ecology.

TI  - A Combination of Stable Isotope Probing, Illumina Sequencing, and Co-occurrence 
      Network to Investigate Thermophilic Acetate- and Lactate-Utilizing Bacteria.
PG  - 113-122
LID - 10.1007/s00248-017-1017-8 [doi]
AB  - Anaerobic digestion is a complicated microbiological process that involves a wide 
      diversity of microorganisms. Acetate is one of the most important intermediates, 
      and interactions between acetate-oxidizing bacteria and archaea could play an 
      important role in the formation of methane in anoxic environments. Anaerobic 
      digestion at thermophilic temperatures is known to increase methane production, 
      but the effects on the microbial community are largely unknown. In the current 
      study, stable isotope probing was used to characterize acetate- and 
      lactate-oxidizing bacteria in thermophilic anaerobic digestion. In microcosms fed 
      (13)C-acetate, bacteria related to members of Clostridium, Hydrogenophaga, 
      Fervidobacterium, Spirochaeta, Limnohabitans, and Rhodococcus demonstrated 
      elevated abundances of (13)C-DNA fractions, suggesting their activities in 
      acetate oxidation. In the treatments fed (13)C-lactate, Anaeromyxobacter, 
      Desulfobulbus, Syntrophus, Cystobacterineae, and Azospira were found to be the 
      potential thermophilic lactate utilizers. PICRUSt predicted that enzymes related 
      to nitrate and nitrite reduction would be enriched in (13)C-DNA fractions, 
      suggesting that the acetate and lactate oxidation may be coupled with nitrate 
      and/or nitrite reduction. Co-occurrence network analysis indicated bacterial taxa 
      not enriched in (13)C-DNA fractions that may also play a critical role in 
      thermophilic anaerobic digestion.

AB  - Sharks, as top order predators, provide a guidance on how contaminants such as 
      mercury bioaccumulate in marine environments. This study assessed the 
      bioaccumulation of mercury (total mercury, THg) in the muscle, liver, red blood 
      cells (RBC), and plasma of pelagic and bigeye thresher sharks (Alopias pelagicus 
      and A. superciliosus) from eastern tropical Pacific. Additionally, the 
      concentration of methylmercury (MeHg) in muscle was also determined to assess 
      risks for human consumption. For both species, muscle THg concentrations (4.05 ± 
      2.15 and 4.12 ± 1.84 μg g(-1) dry weight for pelagic and bigeye thresher shark) 
      were higher than that in other tissues. THg concentrations for all tissues were 
      significantly correlated with precaudal length, with higher accumulation rates 
      after maturity in pelagic than bigeye thresher sharks, suggesting an associated 
      dietary shift at maturation. Correlations among tissues in both species suggested 
      similar transportation and distribution patterns in internal tissues. The δ(13)C 
      values in muscle, RBC and plasma suggested that habitat shifts influenced Hg 
      accumulation, whereas trophic position, estimated by δ(15)N values, had limited 
      effects on patterns of Hg bioaccumulation. Diet shifts towards prey more 
      cephalopods that content higher Hg than small fishes (large fishes: 1.77 μg 
      g(-1); cephalopods: 0.66 μg g(-1) and small fishes 0.48 μg g(-1), dry weight) 
      increased Hg accumulation rates in adult pelagic thresher sharks. Concentrations 
      of MeHg in the muscle of both thresher shark (3.42 ± 1.68 μg g(-1) in A. 
      pelagicus and 3.78 ± 2.13 μg g(-1) in A. superciliosus) exceeded the recommended 
      levels for human consumption. This research provides insight into the factors 
      influencing mercury bioaccumulation in thresher sharks, which are essential for 
      the management and conservation of these species.

TI  - Selenium supplementation affects the retention of stable isotopes of selenium in 
      human subjects consuming diets low in selenium.
PG  - 357-60
AB  - Twenty-nine women and fifteen men from an area of low Se intake (South Island of 
      New Zealand) consumed 100 micrograms stable 74Se, as selenate given in water 
      after an overnight fast, and blood was collected for 3 weeks. They were then 
      divided into five groups and supplemented with 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 micrograms 
      Se/d (as selenomethionine) for 5 months. After 5 months, they received a second 
      dose of 74Se identical to the first. Supplementation significantly altered 
      retention of 74Se in the plasma, but not in the erythrocytes or platelets. 
      Subjects receiving the placebo retained the greatest amount, and subjects 
      receiving 30 micrograms supplemental Se/d retained the least 74Se. 
      Supplementation resulted in relatively more isotope being retained in a medium 
      molecular mass protein considered to be albumin, and relatively less in another 
      fraction considered to be selenoprotein P. The lack of many observed changes in 
      retention of stable Se, and the shift in retention among the plasma proteins, 
      suggests that supplemental Se was not being used to replete critical pools of Se, 
      probably because of adaptation to low Se intake.

AB  - The occurrence of the signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus in the Valla 
      Stream was the first established population of this invasive species recorded in 
      an Italian stream ecosystem. We evaluated the seasonality of diet and trophic 
      niche of invasive signal crayfish in order to estimate the ecological role and 
      effects on native communities of the stream ecosystem. We studied the differences 
      in food source use between sexes, life stages and seasons using carbon and 
      nitrogen stable isotope analyses. To supplement stable isotope analyses, we 
      evaluated food source usage using traditional stomach content analysis. We tested 
      the hypothesis that juveniles have a different diet, showing different trophic 
      niches, compared to adults. Results indicated that signal crayfish adult and 
      juvenile diets mainly rely on macroinvertebrates and periphyton in summer, 
      shifting to mostly periphyton in autumn. Although the two age classes occupied an 
      equivalent trophic niche, juveniles showed slightly different carbon isotope 
      values, suggesting a somewhat ontogenetic shift consistent among seasons. No 
      significant differences were found in adult and juvenile diets between summer and 
      autumn seasons. Our findings suggest that signal crayfish juveniles and adults 
      exhibited seasonal feeding habits, probably due to ecological behaviour rather 
      than food resource availability, and that both are likely to impose similar 
      effects on macroinvertebrate communities in this and similar stream ecosystems.

AB  - Most crop species form a symbiotic association with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) 
      fungi, receiving plant photosynthate and exchanging nutrients from the soil. The 
      plant carbon (C) allocation to AM fungi and the nitrogen feedback are rarely 
      studied together. In this study, a dual (13)CO2 and (15)NH4(15)NO3 pulse labeling 
      experiment was carried out to determine the allocation of recent photosynthates 
      to mycorrhizal hyphae and the translocation of N absorbed by hyphae to strawberry 
      plants. Plants were grown in pots in which a 50 μm mesh net allowed the physical 
      separation of the mycorrhizal hyphae from the roots in one portion of the pot. An 
      inorganic source of (15)N was added to the hyphal compartment at the same time of 
      the (13)CO2 pulse labeling. One and seven days after pulse labeling, the plants 
      were destructively harvested and the amount of the recently fixed carbon (C) and 
      of the absorbed N was determined. (13)C allocated to belowground organs such as 
      roots and mycorrhizal hyphae accounted for an average of 10%, with 4.3% allocated 
      to mycorrhizal hyphae within the first 24h after the pulse labeling. Mycorrhizae 
      absorbed labeled inorganic nitrogen, of which almost 23% was retained in the 
      fungal mycelium. The N uptake was linearly correlated with the (13)C fixed by the 
      plants suggesting a positive correlation between a plant photosynthetic rate and 
      the hyphal absorption capacity.

AB  - Elasmobranchs are among the species most threatened by overfishing and a large 
      body of evidence reports their decline around the world. As they are large 
      predators occupying the highest levels of marine food webs, their removal can 
      alter the trophic web dynamic through predatory release effects and trophic 
      cascade. Suitable management of threatened shark species requires a good 
      understanding of their behaviour and feeding ecology. In this study we provide 
      one of the first assessments of the trophic ecology of the "vulnerable" 
      smooth-hounds Mustelus mustelus and M. punctulatus in the Central Mediterranean 
      Sea, based on stomach contents and stable isotope analyses. Ontogenetic diet 
      changes were addressed by comparing the feeding habits of three groups of 
      individuals: juveniles, maturing and adults. Our results highlighted that the two 
      species share a similar diet based mostly on the consumption of benthic 
      crustaceans (e.g. hermit crabs). Their trophic level increases during ontogeny, 
      with adults increasing their consumption of large-sized crustaceans (e.g. Calappa 
      granulata, Palinurus elephas), cephalopods (e.g. Octopus vulgaris) and fish (e.g. 
      Trachurus trachurus). Our results provide also evidence of ontogenetic shifts in 
      diet for both species showing a progressive reduction of interspecific trophic 
      overlap during growth. The results of this study contribute to improve the 
      current knowledge on the trophic ecology of these two threatened sharks in the 
      Strait of Sicily, thus providing a better understanding of their role in the food 
      web.

AB  - The conventional microbial cell analyses are mostly population-averaged methods 
      that conceal the characteristics of single-cell in the community. Single-cell 
      analysis can provide information on the functional and structural variation of 
      each cell, resulting in the elimination of long and tedious microbial cultivation 
      techniques. Raman spectroscopy is a label-free, noninvasive, and in-vivo method 
      ideal for single-cell measurement to obtain spatially resolved chemical 
      information. In the current review, recent developments in Raman spectroscopic 
      techniques for microbial characterization at the single-cell level are presented, 
      focusing on Raman imaging of single cells to study the intracellular distribution 
      of different components. The review also discusses the limitation and challenges 
      of each technique and put forward some future outlook for improving Raman 
      spectroscopy-based techniques for single-cell analysis. Raman spectroscopic 
      methods at the single-cell level have potential in precision measurements, 
      metabolic analysis, antibiotic susceptibility testing, resuscitation capability, 
      and correlating phenotypic information to genomics for cells, the integration of 
      Raman spectroscopy with other techniques such as microfluidics, stable isotope 
      probing (SIP), and atomic force microscope can further improve the resolution and 
      provide extensive information. Future focuses should be given to advance 
      algorithms for data analysis, standardized reference libraries, and automated 
      cell isolation techniques in future.

TI  - Rapid turnover of tissue nitrogen of primary consumers in tropical freshwaters.
PG  - 12-21
AB  - Stable isotopes are widely used as time-integrating tracers of trophic 
      interactions, but turnover rates of isotopes in animal tissues remain poorly 
      understood. Here, we report nitrogen (N) isotope turnover rates in tissues of 
      four primary consumer species: Ancistrus triradiatus armored catfish (muscle, 
      fins, and whole blood), Tarebia granifera snails (muscle), and Rana palmipes 
      tadpoles (muscle) from a Venezuelan river, and Lavigeria grandis snails (muscle) 
      from Lake Tanganyika, East Africa. Turnover was estimated from the dilution of a 
      15N label introduced into consumer tissues by feeding on 15N-enriched periphyton. 
      Muscle turnover rates were rapid (0.5-3.8% per day), and were attributable to 
      metabolic replacement of N as well as growth in catfish and snails. N turnover in 
      catfish muscle decreased with size, and fin tissue turned over more rapidly than 
      whole blood or muscle, though the difference was not significant. Our results 
      indicate that stable isotope signatures of these tropical species could change 
      markedly within weeks following a shift in diet. However, generalization across 
      taxa or latitudes is complicated by the strong size-dependence of isotope 
      turnover rates. The enrichment-dilution approach outlined here may facilitate 
      measurement of isotopic turnover in a wide variety of consumers under field 
      conditions.

TI  - Compound-Specific Stable Isotope Analysis Provides New Insights for Tracking 
      Human Monomethylmercury Exposure Sources.
PG  - 12493-12503
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.1c01771 [doi]
AB  - Monomethylmercury (MMHg) exposure can induce adverse neurodevelopmental effects 
      in humans and is a global environmental health concern. Human exposure to MMHg 
      occurs predominately through the consumption of fishery foods and rice in Asia, 
      but it is challenging to quantify these two exposure sources. Here, we 
      innovatively utilized MMHg compound-specific stable isotope analyses (MMHg-CSIA) 
      of the hair to quantify the human MMHg sources in coastal and inland areas, where 
      fishery foods and rice are routinely consumed. Our data showed that the fishery 
      foods and rice end members had distinct Δ(199)Hg(MMHg) values in both coastal and 
      inland areas. The Δ(199)Hg(MMHg) values of the human hair were comparable to 
      those of fishery foods but not those of rice. Positive shifts in the 
      δ(202)Hg(MMHg) values of the hair from diet were observed in the study areas. 
      Additionally, significant differences in δ(202)Hg versus Δ(199)Hg were detected 
      between MMHg and inorganic Hg (IHg) in the human hair but not in fishery foods 
      and rice. A binary mixing model was developed to estimate the human MMHg 
      exposures from fishery foods and rice using Δ(199)Hg(MMHg) data. The model 
      results suggested that human MMHg exposures were dominated (>80%) by fishery food 
      consumption and were less affected by rice consumption in both the coastal and 
      inland areas. This study demonstrated that the MMHg-CSIA method can provide 
      unique information for tracking human MMHg exposure sources by excluding the 
      deviations from dietary surveys, individual MMHg absorption/demethylation 
      efficiencies, and the confounding effects of IHg.

TI  - Carbon sources and trophic relationships of ice seals during recent environmental 
      shifts in the Bering Sea.
PG  - 830-45
AB  - Dramatic multiyear fluctuations in water temperature and seasonal sea ice extent 
      and duration across the Bering-Chukchi continental shelf have occurred in this 
      century, raising a pressing ecological question: Do such environmental changes 
      alter marine production processes linking primary producers to upper 
      trophic-level predators? We examined this question by comparing the blubber fatty 
      acid (FA) composition and stable carbon isotope ratios of individual FA (δ¹³CFA) 
      of adult ringed seals (Pusa hispida), bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus), 
      spotted seals (Phoca largha), and ribbon seals (Histriophoca fasciata), 
      collectively known as "ice seals," sampled during an anomalously warm, low sea 
      ice period in 2002-2005 in the Bering Sea and a subsequent cold, high sea ice 
      period in 2007-2010. δ¹³C(FA) values, used to estimate the contribution to seals 
      of carbon derived from sea ice algae (sympagic production) relative to that 
      derived from water column phytoplankton (pelagic production), indicated that 
      during the cold period, sympagic production accounted for 62-80% of the FA in the 
      blubber of bearded seals, 51-62% in spotted seals, and 21-60% in ringed seals. 
      Moreover, the δ¹³CFA values of bearded seals indicated a greater incorporation of 
      sympagic FAs during the cold period than the warm period. This result provides 
      the first empirical evidence of an ecosystem-scale effect of a putative change in 
      sympagic production in the Western Arctic. The FA composition of ice seals showed 
      clear evidence of resource partitioning among ringed, bearded, and spotted seals, 
      and little niche separation between spotted and ribbon seals, which is consistent 
      with previous studies. Despite interannual variability, the FA composition of 
      ringed and bearded seals showed little evidence of differences in diet between 
      the warm and cold periods. The findings that sympagic production contributes 
      significantly to food webs supporting ice seals, and that the contribution 
      apparently is less in warm years with low sea ice, raise an important concern: 
      Will the projected warming and continuing loss of seasonal sea ice in the Arctic, 
      and the associated decline of organic matter input from sympagic production, be 
      compensated for by pelagic production to satisfy both pelagic and benthic carbon 
      and energy needs?

TI  - DNA-SIP identifies sulfate-reducing Clostridia as important toluene degraders in 
      tar-oil-contaminated aquifer sediment.
PG  - 1314-25
LID - 10.1038/ismej.2010.54 [doi]
AB  - Global groundwater resources are constantly challenged by a multitude of 
      contaminants such as aromatic hydrocarbons. Especially in anaerobic habitats, a 
      large diversity of unrecognized microbial populations may be responsible for 
      their degradation. Still, our present understanding of the respective microbiota 
      and their ecophysiology is almost exclusively based on a small number of cultured 
      organisms, mostly within the Proteobacteria. Here, by DNA-based stable isotope 
      probing (SIP), we directly identified the most active sulfate-reducing toluene 
      degraders in a diverse sedimentary microbial community originating from a 
      tar-oil-contaminated aquifer at a former coal gasification plant. On incubation 
      of fresh sediments with (13)C(7)-toluene, the production of both sulfide and 
      (13)CO(2) was clearly coupled to the (13)C-labeling of DNA of microbes related to 
      Desulfosporosinus spp. within the Peptococcaceae (Clostridia). The screening of 
      labeled DNA fractions also suggested a novel benzylsuccinate synthase 
      alpha-subunit (bssA) sequence type previously only detected in the environment to 
      be tentatively affiliated with these degraders. However, carbon flow from the 
      contaminant into degrader DNA was only ∼50%, pointing toward high ratios of 
      heterotrophic CO(2)-fixation during assimilation of acetyl-CoA originating from 
      the contaminant by these degraders. These findings demonstrate that the 
      importance of non-proteobacterial populations in anaerobic aromatics degradation, 
      as well as their specific ecophysiology in the subsurface may still be largely 
      ungrasped.

AB  - Supporting the recovery of large carnivores is a popular yet challenging 
      endeavour. Estuarine crocodiles in Australia are a large carnivore conservation 
      success story, with the population having extensively recovered from past heavy 
      exploitation. Here, we explored if dietary changes had accompanied this large 
      population recovery by comparing the isotopes δ(13)C and δ(15)N in bones of 
      crocodiles sampled 40 to 55 years ago (small population) with bones from 
      contemporary individuals (large population). We found that δ(13)C and δ(15)N 
      values were significantly lower in contemporary crocodiles than in the historical 
      cohort, inferring a shift in prey preference away from marine and into 
      terrestrial food webs. We propose that an increase in intraspecific competition 
      within the recovering crocodile population, alongside an increased abundance of 
      feral ungulates occupying the floodplains, may have resulted in the crocodile 
      population shifting to feed predominantly upon terrestrial food sources. The 
      number of feral pigs consumed to sustain and grow crocodile biomass may help 
      suppress pig population growth and increase the flow of terrestrially derived 
      nutrients into aquatic ecosystems. The study highlights the significance of prey 
      availability in contributing to large carnivore population recovery.

AB  - Stable isotope analysis of the first fossilized Eremotherium laurillardi remains 
      from Belize offers valuable insights into the conditions within which this 
      individual lived and its ability to adapt to the increasing aridity of the Last 
      Glacial Maximum (LGM). Cathodoluminescence (CL) microscopy was used to identify 
      chemical alteration of the tooth during fossilization. Results demonstrate that 
      the inner orthodentin resists diagenesis, yielding potentially unaltered values. 
      Using an intensive "vacuum milling" technique, the inner orthodentin produced an 
      accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) date of 26,975 ± 120 calibrated years before 
      the present. The stable carbon and oxygen isotope analysis of this layer shows 
      that the tooth recorded two wet seasons separated by one longer dry season and 
      that this sloth was able to adapt its diet to the marked seasonality of the LGM. 
      This study offers new insights into obtaining reliable isotope data from 
      fossilized remains and suggests that this individual adapted to climate shifts, 
      contributing to the conversation surrounding megafauna extinction.

TI  - A basal aquatic-terrestrial trophic link in rivers: algal subsidies via 
      shore-dwelling grasshoppers.
PG  - 261-268
LID - 10.1007/s00442-002-0879-7 [doi]
AB  - Rivers provide important resources for riparian consumers, especially in arid or 
      seasonally arid biomes. Pygmy grasshoppers (Paratettix aztecus and P. mexicanus; 
      Tetrigidae) graze river algae stranded along shorelines of the South Fork Eel 
      River in northern California (39°44'N, 123°39'W) as the river recedes during the 
      summer drought. Densities of tetrigids during the mid to late summer were highest 
      (1 individual/m(2) in July) within 1 m of the river margin, and declined to near 
      zero at 4 m from the margin, especially during peak temperatures in the 
      afternoon. These observations suggested that the distribution of tetrigids was 
      determined by the availability of algae, water, or both. We manipulated the 
      presence/absence of water and beached algae (Cladophora glomerata) in a 2×2 
      factorial design. All treatments were positioned 2 m upslope from the river's 
      edge (about 30 cm above the water table), where the cobble bar was naturally dry 
      and devoid of algae and densities of tetrigids were lower than at the river 
      margin (0.4 individuals/m(2) in July). Tetrigids responded only to the wet 
      Cladophora treatment, which had 30× higher densities than other treatments. 
      Stable isotopic signatures (δ(13)C) of tetrigids (-19.7‰) collected from the same 
      cobble bars were more similar to those of epilithic algae (-20.4‰) than 
      terrestrial plants (-28.2‰), and higher than those of acridid grasshoppers 
      (-27.9‰) from the same habitats. Mixing models suggest that 88-100% of the C in 
      tetrigid grasshoppers at our study site is derived from riverine algae. A 
      preliminary analysis suggests that tetrigids ingested sufficient quantities of 
      algae to easily meet their energetic demands during the summer. This study 
      supports the idea that algae, produced in stream systems, can determine the 
      distribution and relative abundance of a common terrestrial scavenger and provide 
      an additional pathway for energy exchange between rivers and riparian food webs.

TI  - Differences in trophic resources and niches of two juvenile predatory species in 
      three Pangani estuarine zones, Tanzania: stomach contents and stable isotope 
      approaches.

LID - 13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Estuaries are primary habitats that serve as feeding and nursery 
      grounds for most juvenile marine fish. However, estuaries have been used as 
      fishing grounds by the artisanal fishers in Tanzania. The slow-growing predatory 
      fish at juvenile and sub-adult stages are among the most frequently caught 
      species that functionally enhance multiple linkages of energy pathways within the 
      food web. Stomach contents and stable isotopes (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) were used to 
      describe the nutritional sources and trophic niches between the co-existing 
      benthic, predatory species, Carangoides chrysophrys and Epinephelus malabaricus 
      in the Pangani estuary, Tanzania. RESULTS: The findings indicated significant 
      inter-specific variations in dietary composition (PERMANOVA, p = 0.001, 
      pseudo-F = 15.81). The prey-specific index of relative importance (%PSIRI) 
      indicated that juvenile shrimps (%PSIRI = 51.4) and Teleostei (%PSIRI = 26.5) 
      were the main diets of C. chrysophrys while brachyura (%PSIRI = 38.8), juvenile 
      shrimps (%PSIRI = 25.6) and Teleostei (%PSIRI = 23.3) were important diets of E. 
      malabaricus. The isotope mixing models indicated that the predatory fish species 
      accumulate nutrients derived from similar autotrophic sources, microphytobenthos, 
      seagrass and macro-algae via consumption of small fish, including clupeids and 
      mugilids. Yet, they significantly showed different isotopic niche width with 
      varying degree of niche overlap across the longitudinal estuary gradient. This 
      situation was justified by the presence of basal food sources among the estuarine 
      zones that isotopically were different. CONCLUSION: The reliance of both 
      predators on clupeids and mugilid preys that are trophically linked with 
      estuarine and marine basal food sources, is an indication of low estuarine food 
      webs' connectivity to the fresh water related food web. This situation is most 
      likely threatening the stability of the estuarine food web structure. Management 
      strategies and plans in place should be cautiously implemented to ensure the 
      balanced anthropogenic freshwater use in the catchment and fishing activities, 
      for the maintenance of the Pangani estuarine ecosystem health.

      isotopic perceptive.

AB  - Documenting long-term changes in the trophic structure of food webs and how 
      species respond to these changes is essential to forecast their vulnerability and 
      resilience to environmental stressors. Over the past decades, the St. Lawrence 
      marine ecosystem (Canada) has experienced major changes in its physical, 
      chemical, and biological conditions from overfishing, acoustic and chemical 
      pollution, climate change, and the increased abundance of some top predators. 
      These changes have likely affected the trophodynamics of the ecosystem, and are 
      suspected to have deleterious effects on endangered species of mammals and other 
      components of the ecosystem, such as blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus), fin 
      whales (B. physalus), and beluga (Delphinapterus leucas). This study examined the 
      trophic structure of the St. Lawrence marine ecosystem, including the isotopic 
      niche of various species, over two periods of contrasting pressures from 
      anthropogenic and climatic stressors (1995-2003 vs. 2019-2021). Stable isotope 
      ratios were measured in 1240 samples of 21 species of marine invertebrates, 
      fishes, and mammals sampled during both periods. A significant change in the 
      isotopic value and niche position between periods is observed in most of the 
      sampled species. While the direction of change and effect size were not uniform 
      among species, these changes confirmed that substantial modifications in 
      community structure have occurred over time. Niche overlap decreased considerably 
      among some of the pelagic and demersal fishes, and among whale species during the 
      most recent period. Combined with a concomitant reduction in niche breadth in 
      several species, these observations suggested that resource sharing was limited 
      among these species. This study highlighted some degree of dietary plasticity in 
      several species, and a long-term change in the trophic structure of the St. 
      Lawrence marine ecosystem, with likely effects on diet composition and energetics 
      of several populations, including endangered species.

TI  - Cultivation-independent and cultivation-dependent metagenomes reveal genetic and

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cultivation-independent methods, including metagenomics, are tools 
      for the exploration and discovery of biotechnological compounds produced by 
      microbes in natural environments. Glycoside hydrolases (GHs) enzymes are 
      extremely desired and important in the industry of production for goods and 
      biofuel and removal of problematic biofilms and exopolysaccharide (EPS). Biofilms 
      and EPS are complex, requiring a wide range of enzymes for a complete 
      degradation. The aim of this study was to identify potential GH microbial 
      producers and GH genes with biotechnological potential, using EPS-complex 
      structure (WH15EPS) of Acidobacteria Granulicella sp. strain WH15 as an 
      enrichment factor, in cultivation-independent and cultivation-dependent methods. 
      We performed stable isotope probing (SIP) combined with metagenomics on topsoil 
      litter amended with WH15EPS and coupled solid culture-EPS amended medium with 
      metagenomics. RESULTS: SIP metagenome analysis of the soil litter demonstrated 
      that phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Planctomycetes were 
      the most abundant in WH15EPS amended and unamended treatments. The enrichment 
      cultures in solid culture medium coupled to metagenomics demonstrated an 
      enrichment in Proteobacteria, and the metagenome assembly of this enrichment 
      cultures resulted in 4 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of microbes with low 
      identity (42-86%) to known microorganisms. Among all carbohydrate-active enzymes 
      (CAZymes) retrieved genes, glycoside transferase (GT) was the most abundant 
      family, either in culture-independent or culture-based metagenome datasets. 
      Within the glycoside hydrolases (GHs), GH13 was the most abundant family in both 
      metagenome datasets. In the "heavy" fraction of the culture-independent 
      metagenome SIP dataset, GH109 (α-N-acetylgalactosaminidases), GH117 (agarases), 
      GH50 (agarases), GH32 (invertases and inulinases), GH17 (endoglucanases), and 
      GH71 (mutanases) families were more abundant in comparison with the controls. 
      Those GH families are affiliated to microorganism that are probably capable to 
      degrade WH15EPS and potentially applicable for biofilm deconstruction. Subsequent 
      in culture-based metagenome, the assembled 4 MAGs (unclassified Proteobacteria) 
      also contained GH families of interest, involving mannosidases, lysozymes, 
      galactosidases, and chitinases. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that functional 
      diversity induced by the presence of WH15EPS in both culture-independent and 
      culture-dependent approaches was enriched in GHs, such as amylases and 
      endoglucanases that could be applied in chemical, pharmaceutical, and food 
      industrial sectors. Furthermore, WH15EPS may be used for the investigation and 
      isolation of yet unknown taxa, such as unclassified Proteobacteria and 
      Planctomycetes, increasing the number of current cultured bacterial 
      representatives with potential biotechnological traits. Video Abstract.

TI  - Adapt or die-Response of large herbivores to environmental changes in Europe 
      during the Holocene.
PG  - 2915-2930
LID - 10.1111/gcb.14733 [doi]
AB  - Climate warming and human landscape transformation during the Holocene resulted 
      in environmental changes for wild animals. The last remnants of the European 
      Pleistocene megafauna that survived into the Holocene were particularly 
      vulnerable to changes in habitat. To track the response of habitat use and 
      foraging of large herbivores to natural and anthropogenic changes in 
      environmental conditions during the Holocene, we investigated carbon (δ(13) C) 
      and nitrogen (δ(15) N) stable isotope composition in bone collagen of moose 
      (Alces alces), European bison (Bison bonasus) and aurochs (Bos primigenius) in 
      Central and Eastern Europe. We found strong variations in isotope compositions in 
      the studied species throughout the Holocene and diverse responses to changing 
      environmental conditions. All three species showed significant changes in their 
      δ(13) C values reflecting a shift of foraging habitats from more open in the 
      Early and pre-Neolithic Holocene to more forest during the Neolithic and Late 
      Holocene. This shift was strongest in European bison, suggesting higher 
      plasticity, more limited in moose, and the least in aurochs. Significant 
      increases of δ(15) N values in European bison and moose are evidence of a diet 
      change towards more grazing, but may also reflect increased nitrogen in soils 
      following deglaciation and global temperature increases. Among the factors 
      explaining the observed isotope variations were time (age of samples), longitude 
      and elevation in European bison, and time, longitude and forest cover in aurochs. 
      None of the analysed factors explained isotope variations in moose. Our results 
      demonstrate the strong influence of natural (forest expansion) and anthropogenic 
      (deforestation and human pressure) changes on the foraging ecology of large 
      herbivores, with forests playing a major role as a refugial habitat since the 
      Neolithic, particularly for European bison and aurochs. We propose that high 
      flexibility in foraging strategy was the key for survival of large herbivores in 
      the changing environmental conditions of the Holocene.

TI  - Atlantic cod individual spatial behaviour and stable isotope associations in a 
      no-take marine reserve.
PG  - 2333-2347
LID - 10.1111/1365-2656.14014 [doi]
AB  - Foraging is a behavioural process and, therefore, individual behaviour and diet 
      are theorized to covary. However, few comparisons of individual behaviour type 
      and diet exist in the wild. We tested whether behaviour type and diet covary in a 
      protected population of Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua. Working in a no-take marine 
      reserve, we could collect data on natural behavioural variation and diet choice 
      with minimal anthropogenic disturbance. We inferred behaviour using acoustic 
      telemetry and diet from stable isotope compositions (expressed as δ(13) C and 
      δ(15) N values). We further investigated whether behaviour and diet could have 
      survival costs. We found cod with shorter diel vertical migration distances fed 
      at higher trophic levels. Cod δ(13) C and δ(15) N values scaled positively with 
      body size. Neither behaviour nor diet predicted survival, indicating phenotypic 
      diversity is maintained without survival costs for cod in a protected ecosystem. 
      The links between diet and diel vertical migration highlight that future work is 
      needed to understand whether the shifts in this behaviour during environmental 
      change (e.g. fishing or climate), could lead to trophic cascades.

AB  - This study was designed to address a major source of uncertainty pertaining to 
      coupled carbon-water cycles in montane forest ecosystems. The Sierra Nevada of 
      California was used as a model system to investigate connections between the 
      physiological performance of trees and landscape patterns of forest carbon and 
      water use. The intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE)-an index of CO(2) fixed per 
      unit of potential water lost via transpiration-of nine dominant species was 
      determined in replicated transects along an ∼1,500-m elevation gradient, spanning 
      a broad range of climatic conditions and soils derived from three different 
      parent materials. Stable isotope ratios of carbon and oxygen measured at the leaf 
      level were combined with field-based and remotely sensed metrics of stand 
      productivity, revealing that variation in iWUE depends primarily on leaf traits 
      (∼24% of the variability), followed by stand productivity (∼16% of the 
      variability), climatic regime (∼13% of the variability), and soil development 
      (∼12% of the variability). Significant interactions between species composition 
      and soil properties proved useful to predict changes in forest carbon-water 
      relations. On the basis of observed shifts in tree species composition, ongoing 
      since the 1950s and intensified in recent years, an increase in water loss 
      through transpiration (ranging from 10 to 60% depending on parent material) is 
      now expected in mixed conifer forests throughout the region.

TI  - Micropredator niche differentiation between bulk soil and rhizosphere of an 
      agricultural soil depends on bacterial prey.
LID - 10.1093/femsec/fix103 [doi]
AB  - Predation is a fundamental mechanism of all food webs, but its drivers and 
      organismic connectivities, especially at microbial level, are still poorly 
      understood. Specifically, competitive carbon flows in the presence of multiple 
      micropredators, as well as trophic links within and between microbial kingdoms 
      have rarely been resolved. Here, using maize-planted agricultural soil as a model 
      system, we have investigated the predation of amended bacterial prey by both 
      prokaryotic and eukaryotic micropredators. We have queried how soil compartment 
      (rhizosphere vs bulk soil) and nature of prey (Gram-positive vs Gram-negative) 
      influence predation outcomes. We added 13C-labelled biomass of Pseudomonas putida 
      and Arthrobacter globiformis to soil microcosms and found that P. putida was 
      consumed much more rapidly. Bacteria and microeukaryotes specifically responsive 
      to the biomass amendments were identified by RNA-stable isotope probing. Amongst 
      the bacteria, only a few myxobacteria sequestered C from A. globiformis, whereas 
      a considerable diversity of predatory bacteria incorporated C derived from P. 
      putida. Diverse groups of heterotrophic protists, especially amoeba including 
      Glaeseria, Hartmanella and Vahlkampfia spp., were observed to incorporate 13C 
      from both amendments, but with pronounced niche differentiation between 
      rhizosphere and bulk soil. This provides novel insights into niche partitioning 
      between bacterial and eukaryotic micropredators in soil, driven not only by the 
      nature of bacterial prey itself, but also by soil compartments.

AB  - Interdisciplinary knowledge is necessary to achieve sustainable management of 
      natural resources. However, research is still often developed in an exclusively 
      disciplinary manner, hampering the capacity to holistically address environmental 
      issues. This study focuses on páramo, a group of high-elevation ecosystems 
      situated around ∼3000 to ∼5000 m a.s.l. in the Andes from western Venezuela and 
      northern Colombia through Ecuador down to northern Peru, and in the highlands of 
      Panama and Costa Rica in Central America. Páramo is a social-ecological system 
      that has been inhabited and shaped by human activity since ∼10,000 years BP. This 
      system is highly valued for the water-related ecosystem services provided to 
      millions of people because it forms the headwaters of major rivers in the 
      Andean-Amazon region, including the Amazon River. We present a multidisciplinary 
      assessment of peer-reviewed research on the abiotic (physical and chemical), 
      biotic (ecological and ecophysiological), and social-political aspects and 
      elements of páramo water resources. A total of 147 publications were evaluated 
      through a systematic literature review process. We found that thematically 58, 
      19, and 23 % of the analyzed studies are related to the abiotic, biotic, and 
      social-political aspects of páramo water resources, respectively. Geographically, 
      most publications were developed in Ecuador (71 % of the synthesized 
      publications). From 2010 onwards, the understanding of hydrological processes 
      including precipitation and fog dynamics, evapotranspiration, soil water 
      transport, and runoff generation improved, particularly for the humid páramo of 
      southern Ecuador. Investigations on the chemical quality of water generated by 
      páramo are rare, providing little empirical support to the widespread belief that 
      páramo environments generate water of high quality. Most ecological studies 
      examined the coupling between páramo terrestrial and aquatic environments, but 
      few directly assessed in-stream metabolic and nutrient cycling processes. Studies 
      focused on the connection between ecophysiological and ecohydrological processes 
      influencing páramo water balance are still scarce and mainly related to the 
      dominant vegetation in the Andean páramo, i.e., tussock grass (pajonal). 
      Social-political studies addressed páramo governance and the implementation and 
      significance of water funds and payment for hydrological services. Studies 
      directly addressing water use, access, and governance in páramo communities 
      remain limited. Importantly, we found only a few interdisciplinary studies 
      combining methodologies from at least two disciplines of different nature despite 
      their value in supporting decision-making. We expect this multidisciplinary 
      synthesis to become a milestone to foster interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary 
      dialogue among individuals and entities involved in and committed to the 
      sustainable management of páramo natural resources. Finally, we also highlight 
      key frontiers in páramo water resources research, which in our view need to be 
      addressed in the coming years/decades to achieve this goal.

TI  - Leopard seal diets in a rapidly warming polar region vary by year, season, sex, 
      and body size.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Resolving the preferred prey items and dietary proportions of leopard 
      seals is central to understanding food-web dynamics in the rapidly-warming 
      Antarctic Peninsula region. Previous studies have identified a wide range of prey 
      items; however, due to anecdotal or otherwise limited information, leopard seal 
      diets remain unresolved by seal sex, individual, body size, region, and season. 
      Over the 2013, 2014, and 2017 field seasons we collected scat, tissue samples 
      (red blood cells and plasma; n = 23) for stable isotope analyses, and 
      previously-reported animal-borne video from 19 adult leopard seals foraging near 
      mesopredator breeding colonies at Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island. We summarized 
      a priori diet information from scat and video analysis and applied a 
      three-isotope (δ(13)C, δ(15)N, δ(34)S), four-source (fish, fur seal, krill, 
      penguin) Bayesian mixing model to examine temporal variability in both prey 
      sources and leopard seal tissues. RESULTS: The austral spring diets of males and 
      females focused on Antarctic krill (31.7-38.0%), notothen fish (31.6-36.5%), and 
      penguin (24.4-26.9%) and were consistent across all 3 years. Several lines of 
      evidence suggest the transition to summer foraging was distinct for males and 
      females. Female diets transitioned rapidly to higher δ(15)N values (+2.1‰), 
      indicating increased consumption of penguin (29.5-46.2%) and energy-dense 
      Antarctic fur seal pup (21.3-37.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The seasonal increase in 
      leopard seal δ(15)N values, and thus fur seal in their diet, was predictably 
      related to larger body size; it may also be forcing reductions to the largest 
      Antarctic fur seal colony in the Antarctic Peninsula. Our ensemble sampling 
      approach reduces historical biases in monitoring marine apex predator diets. 
      Further, our results are necessary to best inform regional fisheries management 
      planning.

TI  - Maize benefits the predatory beetle, Propylea japonica (Thunberg), to provide 
      potential to enhance biological control for aphids in cotton.
PG  - e44379

LID - e44379
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biological control provided by natural enemies play an important role 
      in integrated pest management. Generalist insect predators provide an important 
      biological service in the regulation of agricultural insect pests. Our goal is to 
      understand the explicit process of oviposition preference, habitat selection and 
      feeding behavior of predators in farmland ecosystem consisting of multiple crops, 
      which is central to devising and delivering an integrated pest management 
      program. METHODOLOGY: The hypotheses was that maize can serve as habitat for 
      natural enemies and benefits predators to provide potential to enhance biological 
      control for pest insects in cotton. This explicit process of a predatory beetle, 
      Propylea japonica, in agricultural ecosystem composed of cotton and maize were 
      examined by field investigation and stable carbon isotope analysis during 
      2008-2010. PRINCIPAL FINDING: Field investigation showed that P. japonica adults 
      will search host plants for high prey abundance before laying eggs, indicating 
      indirectly that P. japonica adults prefer to inhabit maize plants and travel to 
      cotton plants to actively prey on aphids. The δ(13)C values of adult P. japonica 
      in a dietary shift experiment found that individual beetles were shifting from a 
      C(3)- to a C(4)-based diet of aphids reared on maize or cotton, respectively, and 
      began to reflect the isotope ratio of their new C(4) resources within one week. 
      Approximately 80-100% of the diet of P. japonica adults in maize originated from 
      a C(3)-based resource in June, July and August, while approximately 80% of the 
      diet originated from a C(4)-based resource in September. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: 
      Results suggest that maize can serve as a habitat or refuge source for the 
      predatory beetle, P. japonica, and benefits predators to provide potential to 
      enhance biological control for insect pests in cotton.

TI  - Protozoa enhance foraging efficiency of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi for mineral 
      nitrogen from organic matter in soil to the benefit of host plants.
PG  - 203-211
LID - 10.1111/nph.12249 [doi]
AB  - Dead organic matter (OM) is a major source of nitrogen (N) for plants. The 
      majority of plants support N uptake by symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) 
      fungi. Mineralization of N is regulated by microfauna, in particular, protozoa 
      grazing on bacteria. We hypothesized that AM fungi and protozoa interactively 
      facilitate plant N nutrition from OM. In soil systems consisting of an OM patch 
      and a root compartment, plant N uptake and consequences for plant carbon (C) 
      allocation were investigated using stable isotopes. Protozoa mobilized N by 
      consuming bacteria, and the mobilized N was translocated via AM fungi to the host 
      plant. The presence of protozoa in both the OM and root compartment stimulated 
      photosynthesis and the translocation of C from the host plant via AM fungi into 
      the OM patch. This stimulated microbial activity in the OM patch, plant N uptake 
      from OM and doubled plant growth. The results indicate that protozoa increase 
      plant growth by both mobilization of N from OM and by protozoa-root interactions, 
      resulting in increased C allocation to roots and into the rhizosphere, thereby 
      increasing plant nutrient exploitation. Hence, mycorrhizal plants need to 
      interact with protozoa to fully exploit N resources from OM.

TI  - Comparative organochlorine accumulation in two ecologically similar shark species 
      (Carcharodon carcharias and Carcharhinus obscurus) with divergent uptake based on 
      different life history.
PG  - 2051-60

AB  - Trophic position and body mass are traits commonly used to predict organochlorine 
      burdens. Sharks, however, have a variety of feeding and life history strategies 
      and metabolize lipid uniquely. Because of this diversity, and the 
      lipid-association of organochlorines, the dynamics of organochlorine accumulation 
      in sharks may be predicted ineffectively by stable isotope-derived trophic 
      position and body mass, as is typical for other taxa. The present study compared 
      ontogenetic organochlorine profiles in the dusky shark (Carcharhinus obscurus) 
      and white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), which differ in metabolic 
      thermoregulation and trophic position throughout their ontogeny. Although greater 
      organochlorine concentrations were observed in the larger bodied and higher 
      trophic position white shark (e.g., p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene: 20.2 ± 
      2.7 ng/g vs 9.3 ± 2.2 ng/g in the dusky shark), slopes of growth-dilution 
      corrected concentrations with age were equal to those of the dusky shark. Similar 
      ontogenetic trophic position increases in both species, less frequent white shark 
      seal predation than previously assumed, or inaccurate species-specific growth 
      parameters are possible explanations. Inshore habitat use (indicated by δ(13)C 
      values) and mass were important predictors in white and dusky sharks, 
      respectively, of both overall compound profiles and select organochlorine 
      concentrations. The present study clarified understanding of trophic position and 
      body mass as reliable predictors of interspecific organochlorine accumulation in 
      sharks, whereas regional endothermy and diet shifting were shown to have less 
      impact on overall rates of accumulation.

      the Beaufort Sea.

AB  - Arctic ecosystem dynamics are shifting in response to warming temperatures and 
      sea ice loss. Such ecosystems may be monitored by examining the diet of upper 
      trophic level species, which varies with prey availability. To assess interannual 
      variation in the Beaufort Sea ecosystem, we examined spatial and temporal trends 
      in ringed seal (Pusa hispida) δ(13)C and δ(15)N in claw growth layers grown from 
      1964 to 2011. Stable isotopes were correlated with climate indices, environmental 
      conditions, seal population productivity, and geographic location. Sex and age 
      did not influence stable isotopes. Enriched (13)C was linked to cyclonic 
      circulation regimes, seal productivity, and westward sampling locations. Higher 
      δ(15)N was linked to lower sea surface temperatures, a higher percentage of pups 
      in the subsistence harvest, and sample locations that were eastward and further 
      from shore. From the 1960s to 2000s, ringed seal niche width expanded, suggesting 
      a diversification of diet due to expansion of prey and/or seal space use. 
      Overall, trends in ringed seal stable isotopes indicate changes within the 
      Beaufort Sea ecosystem affected by water temperatures and circulation regimes. We 
      suggest that continued monitoring of upper trophic level species will yield 
      insights into changing ecosystem structure with climate change.

TI  - Importance of sulfate reducing bacteria in mercury methylation and demethylation 
      in periphyton from Bolivian Amazon region.
PG  - 911-6
LID - 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2010.10.050 [doi]
AB  - Sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) are important mercury methylators in sediments, 
      but information on mercury methylators in other compartments is ambiguous. To 
      investigate SRB involvement in methylation in Amazonian periphyton, the 
      relationship between Hg methylation potential and SRB (Desulfobacteraceae, 
      Desulfobulbaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae) abundance in Eichhornia crassipes and 
      Polygonum densiflorum root associated periphyton was examined. Periphyton 
      subsamples of each macrophyte were amended with electron donors (lactate, acetate 
      and propionate) or inhibitors (molybdate) of sulfate reduction to create 
      differences in SRB subgroup abundance, which was measured by quantitative 
      real-time PCR with primers specific for the 16S rRNA gene. Mercury methylation 
      and demethylation potentials were determined by a stable isotope tracer technique 
      using 200HgCl and CH3(202)HgCl, respectively. Relative abundance of 
      Desulfobacteraceae (<0.01-12.5%) and Desulfovibrionaceae (0.01-6.8%) were both 
      highly variable among samples and subsamples, but a significant linear 
      relationship (p<0.05) was found between Desulfobacteraceae abundance and net 
      methylmercury formation among treatments of the same macrophyte periphyton and 
      among all P. densiflorum samples, suggesting that Desulfobacteraceae bacteria are 
      the most important mercury methylators among SRB families. Yet, molybdate only 
      partially inhibited mercury methylation potentials, suggesting the involvement of 
      other microorganisms as well. The response of net methylmercury production to the 
      different electron donors and molybdate was highly variable (3-1104 pg g(-1) in 
      12 h) among samples, as was the net formation in control samples (17-164 pg g(-1) 
      in 12 h). This demonstrates the importance of community variability and 
      complexity of microbial interactions for the overall methylmercury production in 
      periphyton and their response to external stimulus.

AB  - Soils deliver crucial ecosystem services, such as climate regulation through 
      carbon (C) storage and food security, both of which are threatened by climate and 
      land use change. While soils are important stores of terrestrial C, anthropogenic 
      impact on the lateral fluxes of C from land to water remains poorly quantified 
      and not well represented in Earth system models. In this study, we tested a novel 
      framework for tracing and quantifying lateral C fluxes from the terrestrial to 
      the aquatic environment at a catchment scale. The combined use of conservative 
      plant-derived geochemical biomarkers n-alkanes and bulk stable δ(13)C and δ(15)N 
      isotopes of soils and sediments allowed us to distinguish between particulate 
      organic C sources from different land uses (i.e. arable and temporary grassland 
      vs. permanent grassland vs. riparian woodland vs. river bed sediments) (p<0.001), 
      showing an enhanced ability to distinguish between land use sources as compared 
      to using just n-alkanes alone. The terrestrial-aquatic proxy (TAR) ratio derived 
      from n-alkane signatures indicated an increased input of terrestrial-derived 
      organic matter (OM) to lake sediments over the past 60years, with an increasing 
      contribution of woody vegetation shown by the C(27)/C(31) ratio. This may be 
      related to agricultural intensification, leading to enhanced soil erosion, but 
      also an increase in riparian woodland that may disconnect OM inputs from arable 
      land uses in the upper parts of the study catchment. Spatial variability of 
      geochemical proxies showed a close coupling between OM provenance and riparian 
      land use, supporting the new conceptualization of river corridors (active river 
      channel and riparian zone) as critical zones linking the terrestrial and aquatic 
      C fluxes. Further testing of this novel tracing technique shows promise in terms 
      of quantification of lateral C fluxes as well as targeting of effective land 
      management measures to reduce soil erosion and promote OM conservation in river 
      catchments.

TI  - Geographical gradients in diet affect population dynamics of Canada lynx.
PG  - 2736-43
AB  - Geographical gradients in the stability of cyclic populations of herbivores and 
      their predators may relate to the degree of specialization of predators. However, 
      such changes are usually associated with transition from specialist to generalist 
      predator species, rather than from geographical variation in dietary breadth of 
      specialist predators. Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) and snowshoe hare (Lepus 
      americanus) populations undergo cyclic fluctuations in northern parts of their 
      range, but cycles are either greatly attenuated or lost altogether in the 
      southern boreal forest where prey diversity is higher. We tested the influence of 
      prey specialization on population cycles by measuring the stable carbon and 
      nitrogen isotope ratios in lynx and their prey, estimating the contribution of 
      hares to lynx diet across their range, and correlating this degree of 
      specialization to the strength of their population cycles. Hares dominated the 
      lynx diet across their range, but specialization on hares decreased in southern 
      and western populations. The degree of specialization correlated with cyclic 
      signal strength indicated by spectral analysis of lynx harvest data, but overall 
      variability of lynx harvest (the standard deviation of natural-log-transformed 
      harvest numbers) did not change significantly with dietary specialization. Thus, 
      as alternative prey became more important in the lynx diet, the fluctuations 
      became decoupled from a regular cycle but did not become less variable. Our 
      results support the hypothesis that alternative prey decrease population cycle 
      regularity but emphasize that such changes may be driven by dietary shifts among 
      dominant specialist predators rather than exclusively through changes in the 
      predator community.

AB  - The feeding habit of large-head hairtail (Trichiurus lepturus) in the northern 
      South China Sea was investigated through isotopic and stomach content analyses. 
      The isotopic features of the hairtail at the same body size differed among 
      regions, with the fish in coastal waters presenting higher δ(15)N and δ(13)C 
      values compared to those in the open sea, indicating different trophic levels 
      (TL), food habits, and isotopic baselines. According to the partial correlation 
      of water depth with δ(15)N values, the sampling stations were divided into three 
      regions based on the depth of water: coastal (20-40 m), near coastal (60-80 m), 
      and open sea (100-200 m) regions. In the coastal region, the hairtail from 
      stations affected by the Pearl River plume exhibited lower δ(15)N and δ(13)C 
      values. The stomach content analysis indicated different feeding habits of the 
      hairtail from different regions. The hairtail in the coastal and near coastal 
      waters fed more on fish and less on crustaceans compared to the hairtail in the 
      open sea. The relationship between δ(15)N and fish size exhibited two contrary 
      patterns. First, the δ(15)N values increased with increasing preanal length in 
      the hairtail sampled from the water depth of 30-40 m in section F (in fish with 
      preanal length < 200 mm) and those samples from the water depth of 100-200 m. 
      This finding reflected an ontogenetic shift in diet and TL. However, the δ(15)N 
      values tended to decrease with the increasing preanal length of the hairtail 
      samples collected from the water depth of 30-40 m in section F (fish with a 
      preanal length of ~200-300 mm). These findings suggested that under the 
      conditions of insufficient availability of high-quality prey, the larger hairtail 
      fed more on low-TL prey to compensate for the increase energy demand, arising due 
      to growth, which led to the observed decrease in δ(15)N values.

AB  - Widespread in citrus fruits, naringin, a natural 2,3-dihydroflavonoid, is of 
      particular interest to scientists and has a broad range of beneficial 
      bioactivities to health. Orally administered naringin remains in the gut tract 
      for a relatively long time because of its low bioavailability. Under the 
      metabolism mediated by human gut microbiota, naringin could be an active 
      precursor for derived metabolites to play important physiological roles. However, 
      naringin and its metabolites are hard to accurately quantify due to severe 
      endogenic interference. In this study, an analytical rapid resolution liquid 
      chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (RRLC-MS/MS) method coupled with stable 
      isotope deuterium-labeling is developed and validated to simultaneously quantify 
      naringin as well as its major human gut microbial metabolites naringenin and 
      3-(4'-hydroxyphenyl) propanoic acid. By eliminating the matrix interferences, 
      this strategy not only confirms naringenin and 3-(4'-hydroxyphenyl) propanoic 
      acid as the predominant metabolites which contribute to the pharmacological 
      effects of naringin but also provides a suitable choice for other flavonoid 
      pharmacokinetics study.

AB  - Emerging aquatic insects link aquatic and adjacent terrestrial food webs by 
      subsidizing terrestrial predators with high-quality prey. One of the main 
      constituents of aquatic subsidy, the non-biting midges (Chironomidae), showed 
      altered emergence dynamics in response to the mosquito control agent Bacillus 
      thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti). As riparian spiders depend on aquatic 
      subsidy, they may be affected by such changes in prey availability. Thus, we 
      conducted a field study in twelve floodplain pond mesocosms (FPMs), six were 
      treated with Bti (2.88 × 10(9) ITU/ha, VectoBac WDG) three times, to investigate 
      if the Bti-induced shift in chironomid emergence dynamics is reflected in their 
      nutritional value and in the diet of riparian spiders. We measured the content of 
      proteins, lipids, glycogen, and carbohydrates in emerged Chironomidae, and 
      determined the stable isotope ratios of female Tetragnatha extensa, a 
      web-building spider living in the riparian vegetation of the FPMs. We analysed 
      the proportion of aquatic prey in spiders' diet, niche size, and trophic 
      position. While the content of nutrients and thus the prey quality was not 
      significantly altered by Bti, effects on the spiders' diet were observed. The 
      trophic position of T. extensa from Bti-treated FPMs was lower compared to the 
      control while the aquatic proportion was only minimally reduced. We assume that 
      spiders fed more on terrestrial prey but also on other aquatic organisms such as 
      Baetidae, whose emergence was unaffected by Bti. In contrast to the partly 
      predaceous Chironomidae, consumption of aquatic and terrestrial primary consumers 
      potentially explains the observed lower trophic position of spiders from 
      Bti-treated FPMs. As prey organisms vary in their quality the suggested dietary 
      shift could transfer previously observed effects of Bti to riparian spiders 
      conceivably affecting their populations. Our results further support that 
      anthropogenic stressors in aquatic ecosystems may translate to terrestrial 
      predators through aquatic subsidy.

TI  - Microbiology and potential applications of aerobic methane oxidation coupled to 
      denitrification (AME-D) process: A review.

AB  - Aerobic methane oxidation coupled to denitrification (AME-D) is an important link 
      between the global methane and nitrogen cycles. This mini-review updates 
      discoveries regarding aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifiers, as a prelude to 
      spotlight the microbial mechanism and the potential applications of AME-D. Until 
      recently, AME-D was thought to be accomplished by a microbial consortium where 
      denitrifying bacteria utilize carbon intermediates, which are excreted by aerobic 
      methanotrophs, as energy and carbon sources. Potential carbon intermediates 
      include methanol, citrate and acetate. This mini-review presents microbial 
      thermodynamic estimations and postulates that methanol is the ideal electron 
      donor for denitrification, and may serve as a trophic link between methanotrophic 
      bacteria and denitrifiers. More excitingly, new discoveries have revealed that 
      AME-D is not only confined to the conventional synergism between methanotrophic 
      bacteria and denitrifiers. Specifically, an obligate aerobic methanotrophic 
      bacterium, Methylomonas denitrificans FJG1, has been demonstrated to couple 
      partial denitrification with methane oxidation, under hypoxia conditions, 
      releasing nitrous oxide as a terminal product. This finding not only 
      substantially advances the understanding of AME-D mechanism, but also implies an 
      important but unknown role of aerobic methanotrophs in global climate change 
      through their influence on both the methane and nitrogen cycles in ecosystems. 
      Hence, further investigation on AME-D microbiology and mechanism is essential to 
      better understand global climate issues and to develop niche biotechnological 
      solutions. This mini-review also presents traditional microbial techniques, such 
      as pure cultivation and stable isotope probing, and powerful microbial 
      techniques, such as (meta-) genomics and (meta-) transcriptomics, for deciphering 
      linked methane oxidation and denitrification. Although AME-D has immense 
      potential for nitrogen removal from wastewater, drinking water and groundwater, 
      bottlenecks and potential issues are also discussed.

TI  - Effect of body lipid content is linked to nutritional adaptation in the 
      acclimation responses of mesic-adapted Paederus to seasonal variations in 
      desiccation stress.

AB  - Desiccation stress causes mesic-adapted arthropods to lose their body water 
      content. However, mesic-adapted Paederus beetles can survive over prolonged 
      periods under dry field conditions, suggesting that these beetles adopt an array 
      of water conservation mechanisms. We investigated the water balance mechanisms of 
      field-collected Paederus adults over a 14-month sampling period. We also assessed 
      their nutritional adaptations by performing a stable isotope analysis to examine 
      their diet. The water loss rate (WLR) of the beetles was significantly associated 
      with the rice crop cycle and saturation deficit. The cuticular permeability (CP) 
      of adult beetles was maintained at < 30 µg cm(-2)h(-1) mmHg(-1); however, CP 
      increased significantly with the WLR. This result indicates that CP might play a 
      minor role in reducing excessive water loss in beetles. The beetles' body water 
      content and percentage total body water content increased when the WLR was high. 
      Trehalose, glucose, and glycogen did not appear to play a central role in 
      enhancing the water reserves in the insects. The body lipid content ranged from 
      0.22 ± 0.06 to 0.87 ± 0.07 mg and was negatively associated with the WLR. This 
      association indicates that the increase in internal metabolic water was mediated 
      by lipid catabolism. Stable isotope analysis results revealed that the Paederus 
      beetles shifted their diet to carbohydrate-rich plants when the saturation 
      deficit increased and the associated WLR reached its peak; otherwise, they 
      consumed a high amount of staple carbohydrate-poor herbivore prey. The 
      accumulation of energy reserves in the form of lipids through seasonal dietary 
      shifts may exert major effects on the survival and population success of 
      mesic-adapted Paederus beetles.

AB  - Aerobic methane (CH(4)) oxidation coupled to denitrification (AME-D) can not only 
      mitigate CH(4) emission into the atmosphere, but also potentially alleviate 
      nitrogen pollution in surface waters and engineered ecosystems, and it has 
      attracted substantial research interest. O(2) concentration plays a key role in 
      AME-D, yet little is understood about how it impacts microbial interactions. 
      Here, we applied isotopically labeled K(15)NO(3) and (13)CH(4) and metagenomic 
      analyses to investigate the metabolic and microbial link of AME-D at different 
      O(2) levels. Among the four experimental O(2) levels of 21%,10%, 5% and 2.5% and 
      a CH(4) concentration of 8% (i.e., the O(2)/CH(4) ratios of 2.62, 1.26, 0.63 and 
      0.31), the highest NO(3)(-)-N removal occurred in the AME-D system incubated at 
      the O(2) concentration of 10%. Methanol and acetate may serve as the trophic 
      linkage between aerobic methanotrophs and denitrifers in the AME-D systems. 
      Methylotrophs including Methylophilus, Methylovorus, Methyloversatilis and 
      Methylotenera were abundant under the O(2)-sufficient condition with the O(2) 
      concentration of 21%, while denitrifiers such as Azoarcus, Thauera and 
      Thiobacillus dominated in the O(2)-limited environment with the O(2) 
      concentration of 10%. The competition of denitrifiers and methylotrophs in the 
      AME-D system for CH(4)-derived carbon, such as methanol and acetate, might be 
      influenced by chemotactic responses. More methane-derived carbon flowed into 
      methylotrophs under the O(2)-sufficient condition, while more methane-derived 
      carbon was used for denitrification in the O(2)-limited environment. These 
      findings can aid in evaluating the distribution and contribution of AME-D and in 
      developing strategies for mitigating CH(4) emission and nitrogen pollution in 
      natural and engineered ecosystems.

TI  - Screening for Natural Variation in Water Use Efficiency Traits in a Diversity Set 
      of Brassica napus L. Identifies Candidate Variants in Photosynthetic 
      Assimilation.
PG  - 1700-1709
LID - 10.1093/pcp/pcx108 [doi]
AB  - Seed yield and quality of crop species are significantly reduced by water 
      deficit. Stable isotope screening (δ13C) of a diversity set of 147 accessions of 
      Brassica napus grown in the field identified several accessions with extremes in 
      water use efficiency (WUE). We next conducted an investigation of the 
      physiological characteristics of selected natural variants with high and low WUE 
      to understand how these characteristics translate to differences in WUE. We 
      identified an interesting Spring accession, G302 (Mozart), that exhibited the 
      highest WUE in the field and high CO2 assimilation rates coupled with an 
      increased electron transport capacity (Jmax) under the imposed conditions. 
      Differences in stomatal density and stomatal index did not translate to 
      differences in stomatal conductance in the investigated accessions. Stomatal 
      conductance response to exogenous ABA was analyzed in selected high and low WUE 
      accessions. Spring lines showed little variation in response to exogenous ABA, 
      while one Semi-Winter line (SW047) showed a significantly more rapid response to 
      exogenous ABA, that corresponded to the high WUE indicated by δ13C measurements. 
      This research illustrates the importance of examining natural variation at a 
      physiological level for investigation of the underlying mechanisms influencing 
      the diversity of carbon isotope discrimination values in the field and identifies 
      natural variants in B. napus with improved WUE and potential relevant traits.

AB  - Ground-level ozone (O3) pollution affects the plant carbon and water balance, but 
      the relative contributions of impaired photosynthesis and the loss of stomatal 
      functioning to the O3-induced reductions in water-use efficiency (WUE) remain 
      unclear. We combined the leaf stable dual isotopic signatures of carbon (δ13C) 
      and oxygen (δ18O) with related instantaneous gas exchange performance to 
      determine the effects of O3 dose on the net photosynthetic rate (An), stomatal 
      conductance (gs) and intrinsic WUE (iWUE = An/gs) in four tree species (one being 
      a hybrid) exposed to five O3 levels. The iWUE declined for each step increase in 
      O3 level, reflecting progressive loss of the coupling between leaf carbon gain 
      and water loss. In ambient compared with charcoal-filtered air, the decreased 
      iWUE was associated with reductions in both An and gs (i.e., decreased δ13C and 
      increased δ18O). In elevated O3 treatments, however, the iWUE declines were 
      caused by reduced An at constant or increased gs. The results show that the dual 
      isotope approach provides a robust way to gather time-integrated information on 
      how O3 pollution affects leaf gas exchange. Our study highlights that O3-induced 
      decoupling between photosynthesis and stomatal regulation causes large and 
      progressive declines in the WUE of forest trees, demonstrating the need for 
      incorporating this hitherto unaccounted for effect into vegetation models.

AB  - We sampled landlocked Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) from four lakes (Small, 
      9-Mile, North, Amituk) in the Canadian High Arctic that span a gradient of 
      mercury contamination. Metals (Hg, Se, Tl, and Fe) were measured in char tissues 
      to determine their relationships with health indices (relative condition factor 
      and hepatosomatic index), stable nitrogen isotope ratios, and liver histology. A 
      subcellular partitioning procedure was employed to determine how metals were 
      distributed between potentially sensitive and detoxified compartments of Arctic 
      char livers from a low- and high-mercury lake (Small Lake and Amituk Lake, 
      respectively). Differences in health indices and metal concentrations among char 
      populations were likely related to differences in feeding ecology. Concentrations 
      of Hg, Se, and Tl were highest in the livers of Amituk char, whereas 
      concentrations of Fe were highest in Small and 9-Mile char. At the subcellular 
      level we found that although Amituk char had higher concentrations of Tl in whole 
      liver than Small Lake char, they maintained a greater proportion of this metal in 
      detoxified fractions, suggesting an attempt at detoxification. Mercury was found 
      mainly in potentially sensitive fractions of both Small and Amituk Lake char, 
      indicating that Arctic char are not effectively detoxifying this metal. 
      Histological changes in char livers, mainly in the form of melano-macrophage 
      aggregates and hepatic fibrosis, could be linked to the concentrations and 
      subcellular distributions of essential or non-essential metals.

AB  - Few studies have systematically investigated differences in performance, 
      morphology and parasitic load of invaders at different stages of an invasion. 
      This study analyzed phenotype-environment correlations in a fish invasion from 
      initial absence until establishment in the headwater reach of the second largest 
      European river, the Danube. Here, the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) formed 
      73% of the fish abundance and 58% of the fish biomass in rip-rap bank habitats 
      after establishment. The time from invasion until establishment was only about 
      two years, indicating rapid expansion. Founder populations from the invasion 
      front were different from longer established round goby populations in 
      demography, morphology, feeding behaviour, sex ratio and parasitic load, 
      indicating that plasticity in these traits determines invasion success. 
      Competitive ability was mostly dependent on growth/size-related traits rather 
      than on fecundity. As revealed by stable isotope analyses, specimens at the 
      invasion front had a higher trophic position in the food web and seem to benefit 
      from lower food competition. Somatic performance seems to be more important than 
      investment in reproduction during the early stages of the invasion process and 
      upstream-directed range expansion is not caused by out-migrating weak or juvenile 
      individuals that were forced to leave high density areas due to high competition. 
      This mechanism might be true for downstream introductions via drift. Greater 
      abundance and densities of acanthocephalan endoparasites were observed at the 
      invasion front, which contradicts the expectation that invasion success is 
      determined by lower parasitic pressure in newly invaded areas. Overall, the 
      pronounced changes in fish and invertebrate communities with a dominance of alien 
      species suggest invasional meltdown and a shift of the upper Danube River towards 
      a novel ecosystem with species that have greater resistance to goby predation. 
      This seems to contribute to overcoming biological resistance and improve rapidity 
      of dispersal.

AB  - Mercury tissue distribution and its dynamics are poorly understood in 
      elasmobranchs. Total mercury was measured in liver and muscle of male Round 
      Stingrays (Urobatis halleri) from Seal Beach, California, an anthropogenically 
      impacted site, and from the offshore island of Santa Catalina, a less impacted 
      site. Stable isotope analysis was also performed on the muscle and red blood 
      cells (RBCs) of a subset of rays over a range of age classes to investigate 
      mercury accumulation with respect to trophic ecology. Mercury in both tissues was 
      found to be significantly greater in adults than juveniles in mainland rays; 
      however, liver mercury accumulation drastically increased after maturity and was 
      significantly greater in mainland adult rays than Catalina rays. There were no 
      patterns in δ(15)N or δ(13)C with size in muscle; however, there were indications 
      of seasonal changes in RBC δ(15)N, suggesting short term shifts in diet or 
      behavior is likely linked to reproductive status as is mercury accumulation.

TI  - Water subsidies from mountains to deserts: their role in sustaining 
      groundwater-fed oases in a sandy landscape.
PG  - 678-94
AB  - In arid regions throughout the world, shallow phreatic aquifers feed natural 
      oases of much higher productivity than would be expected solely from local 
      rainfall. In South America, the presence of well-developed Prosopis flexuosa 
      woodlands in the Monte Desert region east of the Andes has puzzled scientists for 
      decades. Today these woodlands provide crucial subsistence to local populations, 
      including descendants of the indigenous Huarpes. We explore the vulnerability and 
      importance of phreatic groundwater for the productivity of the region, comparing 
      the contributions of local rainfall to that of remote mountain recharge that is 
      increasingly being diverted for irrigated agriculture before it reaches the 
      desert. We combined deep soil coring, plant measurements, direct water-table 
      observations, and stable-isotopic analyses (2H and 18O) of meteoric, surface, and 
      ground waters at three study sites across the region, comparing woodland stands, 
      bare dunes, and surrounding shrublands. The isotopic composition of phreatic 
      groundwaters (delta2H: -137 per thousand +/- 5 per thousand) closely matched the 
      signature of water brought to the region by the Mendoza River (-137 per thousand 
      +/- 6 per thousand), suggestin that mountain-river infiltration rather than in 
      situ rainfall deep drainage (-39 per thousand +/- 19 per thousand) was the 
      dominant mechanism of recharge. Similarly, chloride mass balances determined from 
      deep soil profiles (> 6 m) suggested very low recharge rates. Vegetation in 
      woodland ecosystems, where significant groundwater discharge losses, likely >100 
      mm/yr occurred, relied on regionally derived groundwater located from 6.5 to 9.5 
      m underground. At these locations, daily water-table fluctuations of 10 mm, and 
      stable-isotopic measurements of plant water, indicated groundwater uptake rates 
      of 200-300 mm/yr. Regional scaling suggests that groundwater evapotranspiration 
      reaches 18-42 mm/yr across the landscape, accounting for 7 17% of the Mendoza 
      River flow regionally. Our study highlights the reliance of ecosystem 
      productivity in natural oases on Andean snowmelt, which is increasingly being 
      diverted to one of the largest irrigated regions of the continent. Understanding 
      the ecohydrological coupling of mountain and desert ecosystems here and elsewhere 
      should help managers balance production agriculture and conservation of unique 
      woodland ecosystems and the rural communities that rely on them.

AB  - Examination of the feeding habits of mammalian species such as the African 
      elephant (Loxodonta africana) that range over large seasonally dynamic areas is 
      exceptionally challenging using field-based methods alone. Although much is known 
      of their feeding preferences from field studies, conclusions, especially in 
      relation to differing habits in wet and dry seasons, are often contradictory. 
      Here, two remote approaches, stable carbon isotope analysis and remote sensing, 
      were combined to investigate dietary changes in relation to tree and grass 
      abundances to better understand elephant dietary choice in the Kruger National 
      Park, South Africa. A composited pair of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper 
      satellite images characterising flushed and senescent vegetation states, typical 
      of wet and dry seasons respectively, were used to generate land-cover maps 
      focusing on the forest to grassland gradient. Stable carbon isotope analysis of 
      elephant faecal samples identified the proportion of C(3) (typically browse)/C(4) 
      (typically grass) in elephant diets in the 1-2 days prior to faecal deposition. 
      The proportion of surrounding C(4) land-cover was extracted using concentric 
      buffers centred on faecal sample locations, and related to the faecal %C(4) 
      content. Results indicate that elephants consume C(4) vegetation in proportion to 
      its availability in the surrounding area during the dry season, but during the 
      rainy season there was less of a relationship between C(4) intake and 
      availability, as elephants targeted grasses in these periods. This study 
      illustrates the utility of coupling isotope and cost-free remote sensing data to 
      conduct complementary landscape analysis at highly-detailed, biologically 
      meaningful resolutions, offering an improved ability to monitor animal 
      behavioural patterns at broad geographical scales. This is increasingly important 
      due to potential impacts of climate change and woody encroachment on broad-scale 
      landscape habitat composition, allowing the tracking of shifts in species 
      utilisation of these changing landscapes in a way impractical using field based 
      methods alone.

      enriched in (15)N, but this mostly has been done at small spatial extents or to 
      document effects of point sources. In this study, we sampled 77 sites along a 
      forest to urban land cover gradient to examine food webs and the use of δ(15)N of 
      periphyton and macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups (FFGs) as indicators 
      of watershed development and nitrogen effects on streams. Functional feeding 
      groups had low δ(15)N variability among taxa within sites. Mean absolute 
      differences between individual taxa and their respective site FFG means were < 
      0.55‰, whereas site means of δ(15)N of FFGs had ranges of approximately 7-12‰ 
      among sites. The δ(15)N of periphyton and macroinvertebrate FFGs distinguished 
      least disturbed streams from those with greater watershed urbanization, and they 
      were strongly correlated with increasing nitrogen concentrations and watershed 
      impervious cover. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling, using δ(15)N of taxa, 
      showed that changes in macroinvertebrate assemblages as a whole were associated 
      with forest-to-urban and increasing nitrogen gradients. Assuming an average +3.4‰ 
      per trophic level increase, δ(15)N of biota indicated that detrital pathways 
      likely were important to food web structure, even in streams with highly 
      developed watersheds. We used periphyton and macroinvertebrate FFG δ(15)N to 
      identify possible management goals that can inform decisions affecting nutrients 
      and watershed land use. Overall, the δ(15)N of periphyton and macroinvertebrates 
      were strong indicators of watershed urban development effects on stream 
      ecosystems, and thus, also could make them useful for quantifying the 
      effectiveness of nitrogen, stream, and watershed management efforts.

AB  - Competition for shared resources is commonly assumed to restrict population-level 
      niche width of coexisting species. However, the identity and abundance of 
      coexisting species, the prevailing environmental conditions, and the individual 
      body size may shape the effects of interspecific interactions on species' niche 
      width. Here we study the effects of interspecific and intraspecific interactions, 
      lake area and altitude, and fish body size on the trophic niche width and 
      resource use of a generalist predator, the littoral-dwelling large, sparsely 
      rakered morph of European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus; hereafter LSR 
      whitefish). We use stable isotope, diet and survey fishing data from 14 subarctic 
      lakes along an environmental gradient in northern Norway. The isotopic niche 
      width of LSR whitefish showed a humped-shaped relationship with increasing 
      relative abundance of sympatric competitors, suggesting widest population niche 
      at intermediate intensity of interspecific interactions. The isotopic niche width 
      of LSR whitefish tended to decrease with increasing altitude, suggesting reduced 
      niche in colder, less productive lakes. LSR whitefish typically shifted to a 
      higher trophic position and increased reliance on littoral food resources with 
      increasing body size, although between-lake differences in ontogenetic niche 
      shifts were evident. In most lakes, LSR whitefish relied less on littoral food 
      resources than coexisting fishes and the niche overlap between sympatric 
      competitors was most evident among relatively large individuals (>250 mm). 
      Individual niche variation was highest among >200 mm long LSR whitefish, which 
      likely have escaped the predation window of sympatric predators. We demonstrate 
      that intermediate intensity of interspecific interactions may broaden species' 
      niche width, whereas strong competition for limited resources and high predation 
      risk may suppress niche width in less productive environments. Acknowledging 
      potential humped-shaped relationships between population niche width and 
      interspecific interactions can help us understand species' responses to 
      environmental disturbance (e.g. climate change and species invasions) as well as 
      the driving forces of niche specialization.

AB  - An accurate description of trophic interactions is crucial to understand 
      ecosystem functioning and sustainably manage marine ecosystems exploitation. 
      Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes were coupled with stomach content analyses to 
      investigate whiting (Merlangius merlangus, Linnaeus, 1758) feeding behavior in 
      the Eastern English Channel and Southern North Sea. Whiting juveniles and adults 
      were sampled in autumn and winter to investigate both ontogenetic and seasonal 
      changes. In addition, queen scallops (Aequipecten opercularis) samples were 
      collected along with fish to be used as isotopic benthic baseline. Results 
      indicated an ontogenetic diet change from crustaceans to fish and cephalopods. In 
      autumn, δ15N values generally increased with fish size while in winter, a 
      decrease of δ15N values with fish size was observed, as a potential result of 
      spatial variation in baseline δ15N values. In winter, a nutrient-poor period, an 
      increase in feeding intensity was observed, especially on the copepod Temora 
      longicornis. This study provides further insights into whiting trophic ecology in 
      relation to ontogenetic and seasonal variations, and it confirms the importance 
      of combining several trophic analysis methods to understand ecosystem 
      functioning.

AB  - Crayfish (Orconectes spp.), Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea), northern hog sucker 
      (hog sucker; Hypentelium nigricans), and smallmouth bass (smallmouth; Micropterus 
      dolomieu) from streams in southeastern Missouri (USA) were analyzed for total 
      mercury (HgT) and for stable isotopes of carbon (δ¹³C), nitrogen (δ¹⁵N), and 
      sulfur (δ³⁴S) to discern Hg transfer pathways. HgT concentrations were generally 
      lowest in crayfish (0.005-0.112 μg/g dw) and highest in smallmouth (0.093-4.041 
      μg/g dw), as was δ¹⁵N. HgT was also lower and δ¹⁵N was higher in all biota from a 
      stream draining a more heavily populated historical lead-zinc mining area than 
      from similar sites with mostly undeveloped forested watersheds. δ¹³C in biota was 
      lowest at spring-influenced sites, reflecting CO₂ inputs and temperature 
      influences, and δ³⁴S increased from south to north in all taxa. However, HgT was 
      not strongly correlated with either δ¹³C or δ³⁴S in biota. Trophic position (TP) 
      computed from crayfish δ¹⁵N was lower in hog suckers (mean=2.8) than in 
      smallmouth (mean=3.2), but not at all sites. HgT, δ¹³C, δ³⁴S, and TP in hog 
      suckers increased with total length (length) at some sites, indicating 
      site-specific ontogenetic diet shifts. Changes with length were less evident in 
      smallmouth. Length-adjusted HgT site means in both species were strongly 
      correlated with HgT in crayfish (r²=0.97, P<0.01), but not with HgT in Corbicula 
      (r²=0.02, P>0.05). ANCOVA and regression models incorporating only TP and, for 
      hog suckers, length, accurately and precisely predicted HgT concentrations in 
      both fish species from all locations. Although low compared to many areas of the 
      USA, HgT (and therefore methylmercury) concentrations in smallmouth and hog 
      suckers are sufficiently high to represent a threat to human health and wildlife. 
      Our data indicate that in Ozark streams, Hg concentrations in crayfish are at 
      least partly determined by their diet, with concentrations in hog suckers, 
      smallmouth, and possibly other higher-level consumers largely determined by 
      concentrations in crayfish and other primary and secondary consumers, fish growth 
      rates, and TP.

      regions of a large river.

LID - 10.1007/s004420050692 [doi]
AB  - Analyses of stable isotope (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) and C:N ratios of food webs within 
      a floodplain and a constricted-channel region of the Ohio River during October 
      1993 and July 1994 indicate that the increasingly influential flood pulse concept 
      (FPC) does not, for either location, adequately address food web structure for 
      this very large river. Furthermore, results of this study suggest that the 
      riverine productivity model (RPM) is more appropriate than the widely known river 
      continuum concept (RCC) for the constricted region of this river. 
      These␣conclusions are based on stable isotope analyses of potential sources of 
      organic matter (riparian C(3) trees, riparian C(4) grasses and agricultural 
      crops, submerged macrophytes, benthic filamentous algae, benthic particulate 
      organic matter, and transported organic matter containing detritus and 
      phytoplankton) and various functional feeding groups of invertebrate and fish 
      consumers. The FPC, which stresses the key contribution of organic matter, 
      particularly terrestrial organic matter, originating from the floodplain to 
      riverine food webs, was judged inappropriate for the floodplain region of the 
      Ohio River for hydrodynamic and biotic reasons. The rising limb and peak period 
      of discharge typically occur in November through March when temperatures are low 
      (generally much less than 10°C) and greater than bank-full conditions are 
      relatively unpredictable and short-lived. The major food potentially available to 
      riverine organisms migrating into the floodplain would be decaying vegetation 
      because autotrophic production is temperature and light limited and terrestrial 
      insect production is minimal at that time. It is clear from our data that 
      terrestrial C(4) plants contribute little, if anything, to the consumer food web 
      (based on δ(13)C values), and δ(15)N values for C(3) plants, coarse benthic 
      organic matter, and fine benthic organic matter were too depleted (∼7-12‰ lower 
      than most invertebrate consumer values) for this organic matter to be supporting 
      the food web. The RPM, which emphasizes the primary role of autotrophic 
      production in large rivers, is the most viable of the remaining two ecosystem 
      models for the constricted-channel region of the Ohio based on stable isotope 
      linkage between sources and consumers of organic matter in the food web. The most 
      important form of food web organic matter is apparently transported (suspended) 
      fine (FTOM) and ultra-fine particulate organic matter. We propose that 
      phytoplankton and detritus of an autochthonous origin in the seston would 
      represent a more usable energy source for benthic (bivalve molluscs, hydropsychid 
      caddisflies) and planktonic (microcrustaceans) suspension feeders than the more 
      refractory allochthonous materials derived from upstream processing of 
      terrestrial organic matter. Benthic grazers depend heavily on nonfilamentous 
      benthic algae (based on gut analysis from a separate study), but filamentous 
      benthic algae have no apparent connection to invertebrate consumers (based on 
      δ(13)C values). Amphipod and crayfish show a strong relationship to aquatic 
      macrophytes (possibly through detrital organic matter rather than living plant 
      tissue). These observations contrast with the prediction of the RCC that food 
      webs in large rivers are based principally on refractory FTOM and dissolved 
      organic matter from upstream inefficiencies in organic-matter processing and the 
      bacteria growing upon these suspended or dissolved detrital compounds. The 
      conclusions drawn here for the Ohio River cannot yet be extended to other 
      floodplain and constricted-channel rivers in temperate and tropical latitudes 
      until more comparable data are available on relatively pristine and moderately 
      regulated rivers.

AB  - Increasing aridity and drought severity forecast for many land areas could reduce 
      the land carbon (C) sink. However, with limited long-term direct measures, it is 
      difficult to distinguish direct drying effects from counter effects of CO2 
      enrichment and nitrogen (N) deposition. Here, we document a >50% decline in 
      production of a native C3 grassland over four decades and assign the forcing and 
      timing to increasing aridity and specifically to declining late-summer rainfall. 
      Analysis of C and N stable isotopes in biomass suggests that enhanced water use 
      efficiency via CO2 enrichment may have slightly ameliorated the productivity 
      decline but that changes in N had no effects. Identical declines in a long-term 
      snow-addition experiment definitively identified increasing late-summer dryness 
      as the cause. Our results demonstrate lasting consequences of recent climate 
      change on grassland production and underscore the importance of understanding 
      past climate-ecosystem coupling to predicting future responses to changing 
      climate.

TI  - Bioaccumulation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance in fish from an urban 
      river: Occurrence, patterns and investigation of potential ecological drivers.

AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitous in aquatic environments 
      and a recent shift toward emerging PFAS is calling for new data on their 
      occurrence and fate. In particular, understanding the determinants of their 
      bioaccumulation is fundamental for risk assessment purposes. However, very few 
      studies have addressed the combined influence of potential ecological drivers of 
      PFAS bioaccumulation in fish such as age, sex or trophic ecology. Thus, this work 
      aimed to fill these knowledge gaps by performing a field study in the Seine River 
      basin (France). Composite sediment and fish (European chub, Squalius Cephalus) 
      samples were collected from four sites along a longitudinal transect to 
      investigate the occurrence of 36 PFAS. Sediment molecular patterns were dominated 
      by fluorotelomer sulfonamidoalkyl betaines (i.e. 6:2 and 8:2 FTAB, 46% of ∑PFAS 
      on average), highlighting the non-negligible contribution of PFAS of emerging 
      concern. C(9)-C(14) perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids, perfluorooctane sulfonic 
      acid (PFOS), perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA) and 10:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate 
      (10:2 FTSA) were detected in all fish samples. Conversely, 8:2 FTAB was detected 
      in a few fish from the furthest downstream station only, suggesting the low 
      bioaccessibility or the biotransformation of FTABs. ∑PFAS in fish was in the 
      range 0.22-3.8 ng g(-1) wet weight (ww) and 11-140 ng g(-1) ww for muscle and 
      liver, respectively. Fish collected upstream of Paris were significantly less 
      contaminated than those collected downstream, pointing to urban and industrial 
      inputs. The influence of trophic ecology and biometry on the interindividual 
      variability of PFAS burden in fish was examined through analyses of covariance 
      (ANCOVAs), with sampling site considered as a categorical variable. While the 
      latter was highly significant, diet was also influential; carbon sources and 
      trophic level (i.e. estimated using C and N stable isotope ratios, respectively) 
      equally explained the variability of PFAS levels in fish.

TI  - Phthalate esters (PAEs) concentration pattern reflects dietary habitats (δ(13)C) 
      in blood of Mediterranean loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta).

AB  - Phthalic acid esters (PAEs) are classified as endocrine disruptors, but it 
      remains unclear if they can enter the marine food-web and result in severe health 
      effects for organisms. Loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) can be chronically 
      exposed to PAEs by ingesting plastic debris, but no information is available 
      about PAEs levels in blood, and how these concentrations are related to diet 
      during different life stages. This paper investigated, for the first time, six 
      PAEs in blood of 18 wild-caught Mediterranean loggerhead turtles throughout 
      solid-phase extraction coupled with gas chromatography-ion trap/mass 
      spectrometry. Stable isotope analyses of carbon and nitrogen were also performed 
      to assess the resource use pattern of loggerhead turtles. DEHP (12-63 ng mL(-1)) 
      and DBP (6-57 ng mL(-1)) were the most frequently represented PAEs, followed by 
      DiBP, DMP, DEP and DOP. The total PAEs concentration was highest in three turtles 
      (124-260 ng mL(-1)) whereas three other turtles had concentrations below the 
      detection limit. PAEs were clustered in three groups according to concentration 
      in all samples: DEHP in the first group, DBP, DEP, and DiBP in the second group, 
      and DOP and DMP in the third group. The total phthalates concentration did not 
      differ between large-sized (96.3 ± 86.0 ng mL(-1)) and small-sized 
      (67.1 ± 34.2 ng mL(-1)) turtles (p < 0.001). However, DMP and DEP were found only 
      in large-sized turtles and DiBP and DBP had higher concentrations in large-sized 
      turtles. On the other hand, DEHP and DOP were found in both small- and 
      large-sized turtles with similar concentrations, i.e. ~ 21.0/32.0 ng mL(-1) and ~ 
      7(.1)/9.9 ng mL(-1), respectively. Winsored robust models indicated that δ(13)C 
      is a good predictor for DBP and DiBP concentrations (significant Akaike 
      Information criterion weight, AIC(wt)). Our results indicate that blood is a good 
      matrix to evaluate acute exposure to PAEs in marine turtles. Moreover, this 
      approach is here suggested as a useful tool to explain the internal dose of PAEs 
      in term of dietary habits (δ(13)C), suggesting that all marine species at high 
      trophic levels may be particularly exposed to PAEs, despite their different 
      dietary habitats and levels of exposure.

TI  - Spatial subsidies in spider diets vary with shoreline structure: Complementary 
      evidence from molecular diet analysis and stable isotopes.
PG  - 8431-8439
LID - 10.1002/ece3.2536 [doi]
AB  - Inflow of matter and organisms may strongly affect the local density and 
      diversity of organisms. This effect is particularly evident on shores where 
      organisms with aquatic larval stages enter the terrestrial food web. The 
      identities of such trophic links are not easily estimated as spiders, a dominant 
      group of shoreline predator, have external digestion. We compared trophic links 
      and the prey diversity of spiders on different shore types along the Baltic Sea: 
      on open shores and on shores with a reed belt bordering the water. A priori, we 
      hypothesized that the physical structure of the shoreline reduces the flow 
      between ecosystem and the subsidies across the sea-land interface. To circumvent 
      the lack of morphologically detectable remains of spider prey, we used a 
      combination of stable isotope and molecular gut content analyses. The two tools 
      used for diet analysis revealed complementary information on spider diets. The 
      stable isotope analysis indicated that spiders on open shores had a marine signal 
      of carbon isotopes, while spiders on reedy shores had a terrestrial signal. The 
      molecular analysis revealed a diverse array of dipteran and lepidopteran prey, 
      where spiders on open and reedy shores shared a similar diet with a comparable 
      proportion of chironomids, the larvae of which live in the marine system. 
      Comparing the methods suggests that differences in isotope composition of the two 
      spider groups occurred because of differences in the chironomid diets: as larvae, 
      chironomids of reedy shores likely fed on terrestrial detritus and acquired a 
      terrestrial isotope signature, while chironomids of open shores utilized an algal 
      diet and acquired a marine isotope signature. Our results illustrate how 
      different methods of diet reconstruction may shed light on complementary aspects 
      of nutrient transfer. Overall, they reveal that reed belts can reduce 
      connectivity between habitats, but also function as a source of food for 
      predators.

TI  - (18)O-labeled phosphate applied to soil appears in the shoots of maize after 
      uptake by roots but not after uptake by an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus.
PG  - 787-793
LID - 10.1007/s00572-018-0849-5 [doi]
AB  - The application of (33)P or (32)P isotopes to directly trace phosphorus (P) 
      uptake during arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis is limited by the 
      radioactivity of the two P isotopes, especially under field conditions. A 
      potential alternative method for tracing P uptake in plant-soil systems relies on 
      the analysis of the stable oxygen (O) isotopes of ortho-phosphate (Pi); however, 
      little is known about the fate of the P-O bond during Pi uptake in AM symbioses. 
      This study investigated whether the abundance of (18)O in Pi extracted from the 
      shoots of maize increased after (18)O-labeled Pi added to soil was taken up by 
      either roots of maize or AM extraradical hyphae. A two-compartment culture 
      system, consisting of a root and AM hyphal compartment (RHC, including both roots 
      and AM hyphae) and an AM hyphal compartment (HC, including only hyphae) was 
      designed, and the AM fungus Funneliformis mosseae was used to inoculate the roots 
      of maize. Our results indicated that the abundance of (18)O in Pi extracted from 
      the maize shoots increased significantly 3 months after the addition of 
      (18)O-labeled Pi to the soil in the pots which only contained roots. The 
      abundance of (18)O was much lower than expected, however, which suggests a great 
      majority of (18)O in labeled Pi was lost in the soil or during Pi metabolism in 
      the shoots of maize. The abundance of (18)O in Pi extracted from the maize shoots 
      did not increase 3 months after (18)O-labeled Pi was added to the HC, and 
      therefore, loss of (18)O in labeled Pi may also occur during Pi metabolism in AM 
      hyphae. Use of (18)O-labeled Pi as a qualitative tracer of P uptake during AM 
      symbiosis appears unfeasible for such a long-term (3 months) experiment, although 
      it should be investigated in a short-term labeling experiment.

TI  - [Characteristics of water use efficiency in a succession series of broadleaved 
      Korean pine forests in Changbai Mountain, China.].
PG  - 1221-1229
LID - 10.13287/j.1001-9332.202104.016 [doi]
AB  - Water use efficiency (WUE) is an objective indicator of plant water use, the 
      research of which is helpful to understand the carbon-water coupling mechanism in 
      terrestrial ecosystems. We investigated WUE of dominant tree species in the 
      succession series of broad-leaved Korean pine forests in Changbai Mountain 
      (middle-aged poplar-birch secondary forest, mature poplar-birch secondary forest, 
      broad-leaved Korean pine forest) by using stable carbon isotope technology. The 
      WUE of three forests under different succession stages decreased in order of 
      broad-leaved Korean pine forest > middle-aged poplar-birch secondary forest > 
      mature poplar-birch secondary forest. In addition, the same tree species had 
      different WUE in different forest stands. The WUE of Populus davidiana and Betula 
      platyphylla in the middle-aged poplar-birch secondary forest was higher than that 
      in mature poplar-birch secondary forest. The WUE of Fraxinus mandshurica in 
      broad-leaved Korean pine forest was much higher than that in middle-aged 
      poplar-birch secondary forest. The WUE of Acer mono and Quercus mongolica in 
      broad-leaved Korean pine forest was higher than that in mature poplar-birch 
      secondary forest. The dominant tree species had different WUE as for wood types 
      which generally presented ring-porous wood species>diffuse-porous wood species. 
      There were different seasonal trends during the growing season among the dominant 
      species in the broad-leaved Korean pine forest. The WUE of Fraxinus mandshurica, 
      Acer mono, Quercus mongolica and Tilia amurensis showed first decreasing and then 
      increasing, while that of Pinus koraiensis was opposite. The WUE of the 
      broad-leaved Korean pine forest was negatively correlated with temperature in the 
      growing season. The different WUE was one of the strategies for dominant species 
      in the broad-leaved Korean pine forest in Changbai Mountains to adapt to the 
      community succession and respond to climate and environmental change.

PG  - 1005-1015

AB  - We utilized natural experiment opportunities presented by differential conditions 
      (presence/absence of seabirds and invasive species) on cays in the Bahamas to 
      study whether interisland variations in food resources contributed to gigantism 
      in Allen Cays Rock Iguanas (Cyclura cychlura inornata). We analyzed the stable 
      carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) isotope values from iguana tissues and 
      resources from each island food web to test the predictions that (1) food webs on 
      islands with seabirds exhibit the influence of marine subsidies from seabird 
      guano, whereas those from non-seabird islands do not, and (2) size differences in 
      iguanas among cays were due to either (a) supplemental food availability from 
      mice and/or seabird carcasses killed by barn owls (Tyto alba) and/or (b) access 
      to more nutrient-rich vegetation fertilized by seabird guano. Food web components 
      from the seabird island (Allen Cay) had 5-9‰ higher δ(15)N values than those on 
      the other cays and Allen Cay plants contained nearly two times more nitrogen. 
      Bayesian stable isotope mixing models indicated that C(3) plants dominated iguana 
      diets on all islands and showed no evidence for consumption of mice or 
      shearwaters. The iguanas on Allen Cay were ~ 2 times longer (48.3 ± 11.6 cm) 
      and ~ 6 times heavier (5499 ± 2847 g) than iguanas on other cays and this was 
      likely from marine-derived subsidies from seabird guano which caused an increase 
      in nitrogen concentration in the plants and a resultant increase in the δ(15)N 
      values across the entire food web relative to non-seabird islands.

AB  - Bacterioplankton are the primary trophic conduit for dissolved organic carbon 
      (DOC) and linking community structure with DOC utilization is central to 
      understanding global carbon cycling. We coupled stable isotope probing (SIP) with 
      16S rRNA pyrosequencing in dark seawater culture experiments on euphotic and 
      mesopelagic communities from the Sargasso Sea. Parallel cultures were amended 
      with equimolar quantities of four DO(13) C substrates to simultaneously evaluate 
      community utilization and population-specific incorporation. Of the substrates 
      tested - two cyanobacterial products (exudates or lysates from a culture of 
      Synechococcus) and two defined monosaccharides (glucose or gluconic acid) - the 
      cyanobacterial exudates were incorporated by the greatest diversity of 
      oligotrophic bacterioplankton populations in surface waters, including taxa from 
      > 10 major subclades within the Flavobacteria, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia 
      and Proteobacteria (including SAR11). In contrast, the monosaccharide glucose was 
      not incorporated by any taxa belonging to extant oligotrophic oceanic clades. 
      Conversely, proteobacterial copiotrophs, which were rare in the ambient water 
      (< 0.1% of sequences), grew rapidly on all DOC amendments at both depths, but 
      with different substrate preferences among lineages. We present a new analytical 
      framework for using SIP to detect DOC incorporation across diverse oligotrophic 
      bacterioplankton and discuss implications for the ecology of bacterial-DOC 
      interactions among populations of diverging trophic strategies.

TI  - Inter- and intraspecific variation in mercury bioaccumulation by snakes 
      inhabiting a contaminated river floodplain.
PG  - 1178-86
LID - 10.1002/etc.2157 [doi]
AB  - Although mercury (Hg) is a well-studied contaminant, knowledge about Hg 
      accumulation in snakes is limited. The authors evaluated Hg bioaccumulation 
      within and among four snake species (northern watersnakes, Nerodia sipedon; queen 
      snakes, Regina septemvittata; common garter snakes, Thamnophis sirtalis; and rat 
      snakes, Elaphe obsoleta [Pantherophis alleghaniensis]) from a contaminated site 
      on the South River (Waynesboro, VA, USA) and two nearby reference sites. Total Hg 
      (THg) concentrations in northern watersnake tail tissue at the contaminated site 
      ranged from 2.25 to 13.84 mg/kg dry weight (mean: 4.85 ± 0.29), or 11 to 19 times 
      higher than reference sites. Blood THg concentrations (0.03-7.04 mg/kg wet wt; 
      mean: 2.24 ± 0.42) were strongly correlated with tail concentrations and were the 
      highest yet reported in a snake species. Within watersnakes, nitrogen stable 
      isotope values indicated ontogenetic trophic shifts that correlated with THg 
      bioaccumulation, suggesting that diet plays a substantial role in Hg exposure. 
      Female watersnakes had higher mean THg concentrations (5.67 ± 0.46 mg/kg) than 
      males (4.93 ± 0.49 mg/kg), but no significant differences between sexes were 
      observed after correcting for body size. Interspecific comparisons identified 
      differences in THg concentrations among snake species, with more aquatic species 
      (watersnakes and queen snakes) accumulating higher mean concentrations (5.60 ± 
      0.40 and 4.59 ± 0.38 mg/kg in tail tissue, respectively) than the more 
      terrestrial species, garter snakes and rat snakes (1.28 ± 0.32 and 0.26 ± 0.09 
      mg/kg, respectively). The results of the present study warrant further 
      investigation of potential adverse effects and will aid in prioritizing 
      conservation efforts.

TI  - Conceptual approaches for the development of dynamic specific activity models of 
      14C transfer from surface water to humans.
PG  - 32-51
AB  - Carbon-14 is a particularly interesting radionuclide from the perspective of dose 
      estimation. Many nuclear facilities, including power reactors, release 14C into 
      the environment, and much of this is as 14CO2. This mixes readily with stable 
      CO2, and hence enters the food chain as fundamental biomolecules. This isotopic 
      mixing is often used as the basis for dose assessment models. The present model 
      was developed for the situation of 14C releases to surface waters, where there 
      are distinct changes in the water 14C activity concentrations throughout the 
      year. Complete isotopic mixing (equilibrium) cannot be assumed. The model 
      computes the specific activity (activity of 14C per mass of total C) in water, 
      phytoplankton, fish, crops, meat, milk and air, following a typical 
      irrigation-based food-chain scenario. For most of the biotic compartments, the 
      specific activity is a function of the specific activity in the previous time 
      step, the specific activity of the substrate media, and the C turnover rate in 
      the tissue. The turnover rate is taken to include biochemical turnover, growth 
      dilution and mortality, recognizing that it is turnover of C in the population, 
      not a tissue or an individual, that is relevant. Attention is paid to the 
      incorporation of 14C into the surface water biota and the loss of any remaining 
      14CO2 from the surface water-air interface under its own activity concentration 
      gradient. For certain pathways, variants in the conceptual model are presented, 
      in order to fully discuss the possibilities. As an example, a new model of the 
      soil-to-plant specific activity relationship is proposed, where the degassing of 
      both 14C and stable C from the soil is considered. Selection of parameter values 
      to represent the turnover rates as modeled is important, and is dealt with in a 
      companion paper.

TI  - Does resource exchange in ectomycorrhizal symbiosis vary with competitive context 
      and nitrogen addition?
PG  - 1331-1344
LID - 10.1111/nph.17871 [doi]
AB  - Ectomycorrhizal symbiosis is essential for the nutrition of most temperate forest 
      trees and helps regulate the movement of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) through 
      forested ecosystems. The factors governing the exchange of plant C for fungal N, 
      however, remain obscure. Because competition and soil resources may influence 
      ectomycorrhizal resource movement, we performed a 10-month split-root microcosm 
      study using Pinus muricata seedlings with Thelephora terrestris, Suillus pungens, 
      or no ectomycorrhizal fungus, under two N concentrations in artificial soil. 
      Fungi competed directly with roots and indirectly with each other. We used stable 
      isotope enrichment to track plant photosynthate and fungal N. For T. terrestris, 
      plants received N commensurate with the C given to their fungal partners. 
      Thelephora terrestris was a superior mutualist under high-N conditions. For S. 
      pungens, plant C and fungal N exchange were not coupled. However, in low-N 
      conditions, plants preferentially allocated C to S. pungens rather than T. 
      terrestris. Our results suggest that ectomycorrhizal resource transfer depends on 
      competitive and nutritional context. Plants can exchange C for fungal N, but 
      coupling of these resources can depend on the fungal species and soil N. 
      Understanding the diversity of fungal strategies, and how they change with 
      environmental context, reveals mechanisms driving this important symbiosis.

TI  - Density-dependent resource selection by a terrestrial herbivore in response to 
      sea-to-land nutrient transfer by seals.
PG  - 1929-1937
LID - 10.1002/ecy.1451 [doi]
AB  - Sea-to-land nutrient transfers can connect marine food webs to those on land, 
      creating a dependence on marine webs by opportunistic species. We show how 
      nitrogen, imported by gray seals, Halichoerus grypus, and traced through stable 
      isotope (δ(15) N) measurements in marram grass, Ammophila breviligulata, 
      significantly alters foraging behavior of a free-roaming megaherbivore (feral 
      horses, Equus ferus caballus) on Sable Island, Canada. Values of δ(15) N 
      correlated with protein content of marram and strongly related to pupping-seal 
      densities, and positively influenced selective foraging by horses. The latter was 
      density dependent, consistent with optimal foraging theory. We present the first 
      demonstration of how sea-to-land nutrient transfers can affect the behavioral 
      process of resource selection (resource use relative to availability) of 
      terrestrial consumers. We hypothesize that persistence of horses on Sable Island 
      is being facilitated by N subsidies. Our results have relevance to advancing 
      theory on trophic dynamics in island biogeography and metaecosystem ecology.

TI  - (2) H-fractionations during the biosynthesis of carbohydrates and lipids imprint 
      a metabolic signal on the δ(2) H values of plant organic compounds.
PG  - 479-491
LID - 10.1111/nph.15016 [doi]
AB  - Hydrogen (H) isotope ratio (δ(2) H) analyses of plant organic compounds have been 
      applied to assess ecohydrological processes in the environment despite a large 
      part of the δ(2) H variability observed in plant compounds not being fully 
      elucidated. We present a conceptual biochemical model based on empirical H 
      isotope data that we generated in two complementary experiments that clarifies a 
      large part of the unexplained variability in the δ(2) H values of plant organic 
      compounds. The experiments demonstrate that information recorded in the δ(2) H 
      values of plant organic compounds goes beyond hydrological signals and can also 
      contain important information on the carbon and energy metabolism of plants. Our 
      model explains where (2) H-fractionations occur in the biosynthesis of plant 
      organic compounds and how these (2) H-fractionations are tightly coupled to a 
      plant's carbon and energy metabolism. Our model also provides a mechanistic basis 
      to introduce H isotopes in plant organic compounds as a new metabolic proxy for 
      the carbon and energy metabolism of plants and ecosystems. Such a new metabolic 
      proxy has the potential to be applied in a broad range of disciplines, including 
      plant and ecosystem physiology, biogeochemistry and palaeoecology.

TI  - Isotopic-based evidence for reduced benthic contributions to fish after a 
      whole-lake addition of nanosilver.
LID - 10.1111/jfb.15526 [doi]
AB  - Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are added as antibacterial and anti-odor agents to a 
      wide range of textiles, with high potential for release into aquatic environments 
      via domestic wastewater. Previous work demonstrating the negative impacts of AgNP 
      exposure on periphyton production suggests benthic primary production could be 
      reduced in aquatic ecosystems impacted by AgNP discharge. To evaluate the 
      potential for AgNPs to alter benthic-pelagic coupling in aquatic ecosystems, 
      tissue-stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen from northern pike (Esox 
      lucius) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were measured before, during, and 
      after the addition of AgNPs to a whole-lake ecosystem, and compared to those 
      collected from a nearby reference lake. A shift in carbon isotope ratios toward 
      more negative values was observed in both P. flavescens and E. lucius collected 
      from the lake where AgNPs were added, with no shift in similar magnitude observed 
      in E. lucius from the reference lake. Consequently, Bayesian estimates of benthic 
      energy consumed decreased by 32% for P. flavescens and by 40% for E. lucius 
      collected after AgNP additions relative to pre-addition estimates, greater in 
      magnitude or opposite in direction of trends observed in our reference lake. 
      Analyses suggest no changes in fish nitrogen isotope ratios related to AgNP 
      additions. We hypothesize that the observed reduction in littoral energy use of 
      fish reported here is a response to AgNP settling in littoral benthic 
      habitats-the main habitat in lakes supporting periphyton-as AgNP has been shown 
      elsewhere to significantly reduce the rates of periphyton production. Further, 
      our study highlights the need to broaden the scope of risk assessments for AgNPs 
      and other emerging contaminants prone to settling to consider habitat-specific 
      impacts on resource utilization by organisms after their release into aquatic 
      ecosystems.

TI  - The influence of productivity and width of littoral zone on the trophic position 
      of a large-bodied omnivore.
PG  - 681-90
LID - 10.1007/s00442-008-1019-9 [doi]
AB  - Omnivory is common in many food webs. Omnivores in different habitats can 
      potentially change their feeding behaviour and alter their trophic position and 
      role according to habitat conditions. Here we examine the trophic level and diet 
      of the omnivorous signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) in gradients of 
      trophic status and lake size, both of which have been previously suggested to 
      affect trophic position of predators separately or combined as productive space. 
      We found the trophic position of omnivorous crayfish to be positively correlated 
      with lake trophic status, but found no evidence for any influence of lake size or 
      productive space on crayfish trophic position. The higher trophic position of 
      crayfish in eutrophic lakes was largely caused by a shift in crayfish diet and 
      not by an increase in trophic links in basal parts of the food web. Hence, our 
      results support the "productivity hypothesis," suggesting that food chains can be 
      longer in more productive systems. Furthermore, stable isotope data indicated 
      that larger crayfish are more predatory than smaller crayfish in lakes with wider 
      littoral zones. Wider littoral zones promoted the development of intrapopulation 
      differences in trophic position whereas narrow littoral zones did not. Hence, 
      differences in habitat quality between and within lakes seem to influence the 
      trophic positions of omnivorous crayfish.

AB  - Reproductive success of seabirds is tightly associated with availability of their 
      prey for which the spatiotemporal distribution may be influenced by sea surface 
      temperature (SST) fluctuations. The objective of this study was to investigate 
      whether Northern gannets (Morus bassanus) from the largest colony in North 
      America (Bonaventure Island, Quebec, Canada) were in negative nutritional state 
      during the unprecedented low reproductive success year of 2012, and whether this 
      was associated with changes in SST anomalies and diet. The incubation period of 
      gannets in 2012 was characterized by a significant decline, from early to late 
      incubation, in plasma triglyceride levels that was associated with an increase in 
      plasma corticosterone levels. However, no changes in plasma glycerol and 
      β-hydroxybutyrate levels were noted. SST anomalies recorded in this area (south 
      of the Gulf of St. Lawrence) during the breeding period were consistently higher 
      in 2012 compared to the previous year (a better reproductive success year). Based 
      on signatures of stable carbon (δ(13)C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) isotopes in gannet 
      red blood cells and in whole fish homogenates of three major preys (mackerel, 
      herring, and capelin), a minor dietary shift was noted between those years and 
      incubation periods. In light of these findings, it is suggested that the extreme 
      warm-water perturbation event that prevailed in the Gulf of St. Lawrence during 
      summer 2012 was associated with a rapid deterioration of nutritional condition of 
      Bonaventure Island gannets during the incubation. These suboptimal physiological 
      changes likely contributed to the dramatic decline in reproductive success 
      reported in this colony.

      Middle Pleistocene Snake Cave in Northeastern Thailand.

AB  - Thailand's geographical location in the tropics and almost complete, relatively 
      uninterrupted forest cover makes it valuable for paleodiet and paleoclimate 
      research. We present the first dietary and environmental reconstructions in 
      Northeastern Thailand, using stable isotope abundances in mammalian tooth enamel 
      from the late Middle Pleistocene locality, Tham Wiman Nakin (Snake Cave), which 
      reflect a much higher (over 70%) than modern (13%) occurrence of C4 plants. 
      Bovids and cervids appear to have had almost entirely a C4 plant diet. Carnivores 
      consumed a mixture of C3 (suids) and C4 (bovids, cervids) consumers. Rhinoceroses 
      and orangutan appear to have maintained their preference through time for 
      forested or open C3 environment, respectively. (13)C/(12)C from bone bioapatite, 
      horn and hair of modern Southeast Asian mammals almost exclusively demonstrate C3 
      vegetation dominance. C4 consumption is rare in analysed modern species and it 
      could be related to anthropogenic influences such as ingestion of domestic crops 
      or livestock. Interesting implications emerge in the C4 vegetation distribution 
      in southern Eurasian ecosystems, indicating that Southeast Asia, south of the 
      Tibet, could be part of the global C4 vegetation spread, which occurred around 7 
      Ma. However, the C4 percentage in ecosystems varied geographically. Despite 
      modern reversal towards C3 habitats due to factors such as increasing CO(2), we 
      think that anthropological influences may be responsible for habitat and dietary 
      changes in extant species. Bovids demonstrate the most significant shift in diet 
      and habitat through time, from C4-dominated open habitats to C3-dominated 
      habitats indicative of dense forest understory.

AB  - Theories attempting to explain species coexistence in plant communities have 
      argued in favour of species' capacities to occupy a multidimensional niche with 
      spatial, temporal and biotic axes. We used the concept of hydrological niche 
      segregation to learn how ecological niches are structured both spatially and 
      temporally and whether small scale humidity gradients between adjacent niches are 
      the main factor explaining water partitioning among tree species in a highly 
      water-limited semiarid forest ecosystem. By combining geophysical methods, 
      isotopic ecology, plant ecophysiology and anatomical measurements, we show how 
      coexisting pine and oak species share, use and temporally switch between diverse 
      spatially distinct niches by employing a set of functionally coupled plant traits 
      in response to changing environmental signals. We identified four geospatial 
      niches that turned into nine, when considering the temporal dynamics of the 
      wetting/drying cycles in the substrate and the particular plant species 
      adaptations to garner, transfer, store and use water. Under water scarcity, pine 
      and oak exhibited water use segregation from different niches, yet under maximum 
      drought when oak trees crossed physiological thresholds, niche overlap occurred. 
      The identification of niches and mechanistic understanding of when and how 
      species use them will help unify theories of plant coexistence and competition.

TI  - Simulated eutrophication and browning alters zooplankton nutritional quality and 
      determines juvenile fish growth and survival.
PG  - 2671-2687
LID - 10.1002/ece3.3832 [doi]
AB  - The first few months of life is the most vulnerable period for fish and their 
      optimal hatching time with zooplankton prey is favored by natural selection. 
      Traditionally, however, prey abundance (i.e., zooplankton density) has been 
      considered important, whereas prey nutritional composition has been largely 
      neglected in natural settings. High-quality zooplankton, rich in both essential 
      amino acids (EAAs) and fatty acids (FAs), are required as starting prey to 
      initiate development and fast juvenile growth. Prey quality is dependent on 
      environmental conditions, and, for example, eutrophication and browning are two 
      major factors defining primary producer community structures that will directly 
      determine the nutritional quality of the basal food sources (algae, bacteria, 
      terrestrial matter) for zooplankton. We experimentally tested how eutrophication 
      and browning affect the growth and survival of juvenile rainbow trout 
      (Oncorhynchus mykiss) by changing the quality of basal resources. We fed the fish 
      on herbivorous zooplankton (Daphnia) grown with foods of different nutritional 
      quality (algae, bacteria, terrestrial matter), and used GC-MS, stable isotope 
      labeling as well as bulk and compound-specific stable isotope analyses for 
      detecting the effects of different diets on the nutritional status of fish. The 
      content of EAAs and omega-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) in basal foods and 
      zooplankton decreased in both eutrophication and browning treatments. The 
      decrease in ω-3 PUFA and especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was reflected to 
      fish juveniles, but they were able to compensate for low availability of EAAs in 
      their food. Therefore, the reduced growth and survival of the juvenile fish was 
      linked to the low availability of DHA. Fish showed very low ability to convert 
      alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) to DHA. We conclude that eutrophication and browning 
      decrease the availability of the originally phytoplankton-derived DHA for 
      zooplankton and juvenile fish, suggesting bottom-up regulation of food web 
      quality.

AB  - Bioaccumulation through diet is the predominant source of metal(loid)s in fishes; 
      however, the trophic transfer of metal(loid)s from the diet to aquatic organisms 
      remains largely unclear. In this study, aquatic organisms and five potential food 
      sources (leaf litter, coarse and fine particulate organic matter (CPOM and FPOM, 
      respectively), epilithon and fish) were collected around the Shimen Realgar Mine 
      of China. Stomach content analysis and stable nitrogen and carbon isotope 
      analysis, combined with a new Bayesian mixing model (MixSIAR), were used to 
      quantify diet compositions of aquatic organisms. The δ(13)C and δ(15)N values 
      varied among fish sizes and sampling sites and were probably related to the diet 
      shift of aquatic organisms. The MixSIAR modelling results showed that the aquatic 
      organisms' food sources were mainly composed of FPOM (9%-68%) and epilithon 
      (15%-65%), with leaf litter, CPOM and fish accounting for smaller proportions 
      (2%-30%). Concentrations ranged from 0.91 to 1298 mg/kg for As, 0.01-1.30 mg/kg 
      for Cd, 0.12-37.79 mg/kg for Pb, 0.63-1158 mg/kg for Cr, 1.22-411 mg/kg for Cu, 
      0.82-1772 mg/kg for Mn, 0.31-542 mg/kg for Ni and 21.84-1414 mg/kg for Zn in all 
      the collected samples, including the aquatic organisms and the relevant food 
      sources. The metal(loid) concentrations in the CPOM, FPOM and epilithon were 
      significantly higher than those in aquatic organisms and leaf litter. In 
      addition, the biomagnification factors were all less than 1, indicating a 
      biodilution from diet to freshwater organisms. The predominant As species were 
      organic As in aquatic organisms, while inorganic As was common in their food 
      sources, indicating that As biotransformation occurred within the freshwater food 
      chain.

      partitioning in tree growth, resource acquisition and C sequestration. However, 
      this is associated with challenges as regards the choice of a tracer, the methods 
      of tracing labelled C in tree and soil compartments and the quantitative analysis 
      of C dynamics. Based on data from 47 studies, the rate of transfer differs 
      between broadleaved and coniferous species and decreases as temperature and soil 
      water content decrease. Labelled C is rapidly transferred belowground-within a 
      few days or less-and this transfer is slowed down by drought. Half-lives of 
      labelled C in phloem sap (transfer pool) and in mature leaves (source organs) are 
      short, while those of sink organs (growing tissues, seasonal storage) are longer. 
      (13)C measurements in respiratory efflux at high temporal resolution provide the 
      best estimate of the mean residence times of C in respiratory substrate pools, 
      and the best basis for compartmental modelling. Seasonal C dynamics and 
      allocation patterns indicate that sink strength variations are important drivers 
      for C fluxes. We propose a conceptual model for temperate and boreal trees, which 
      considers the use of recently assimilated C versus stored C. We recommend best 
      practices for designing and analysing pulse-labelling experiments, and identify 
      several topics which we consider of prime importance for future research on C 
      allocation in trees: (i) whole-tree C source-sink relations, (ii) C allocation to 
      secondary metabolism, (iii) responses to environmental change, (iv) effects of 
      seasonality versus phenology in and across biomes, and (v) carbon-nitrogen 
      interactions. Substantial progress is expected from emerging technologies, but 
      the largest challenge remains to carry out in situ whole-tree labelling 
      experiments on mature trees to improve our understanding of the environmental and 
      physiological controls on C allocation.

AB  - We present four datasets that provide information on primary production, nitrogen 
      (N) uptake and allocation in two salt marsh grasses, short-form Spartina 
      alterniflora and Distichlis spicata. These four datasets were generated during a 
      month-long stable isotope ((15)N) tracer study described in the companion 
      manuscript (Hill et al., 2018). They include an allometry dataset containing mass 
      and height data for individual plants harvested from Colt State Park, Bristol, 
      Rhode Island and used to nondestructively estimate plant masses. A second dataset 
      contains weekly stem height measurements collected over the course of the (15)N 
      tracer study. Also included are high resolution data from 49 vegetated 
      compartments (leaves, stems, fine/coarse roots, rhizomes) and bulk sediment depth 
      intervals, reporting the mass, carbon and N concentrations, and stable isotope 
      ratios measured following the harvest of cores over time. Additionally, we 
      provide a complementary dataset with estimates of microbial removal from 
      potential and ambient denitrification enzyme assays. These data, along with 
      source code used in their analysis, are compiled in the NitrogenUptake2016 R 
      package available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network.

TI  - Soil-plant N processes in a High Arctic ecosystem, NW Greenland are altered by 
      long-term experimental warming and higher rainfall.
PG  - 3529-39
LID - 10.1111/gcb.12318 [doi]
AB  - Rapid temperature and precipitation changes in High Arctic tundra ecosystems are 
      altering the biogeochemical cycles of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), but in ways 
      that are difficult to predict. The challenge grows from the uncertainty of N 
      cycle responses and the extent to which shifts in soil N are coupled with the C 
      cycle and productivity of tundra systems. We used a long-term (since 2003) 
      experiment of summer warming and supplemental summer water additions to a High 
      Arctic ecosystem in NW Greenland, and applied a combination of discrete sampling 
      and in situ soil core incubations to measure C and N pools and seasonal microbial 
      processes that might control plant-available N. We hypothesized that elevated 
      temperature and increased precipitation would stimulate microbial activity and 
      net inorganic N mineralization, thereby increasing plant N-availability through 
      the growing season. While we did find increased N mineralization rates under both 
      global change scenarios, water addition also significantly increased net 
      nitrification rates, loss of NO3 (-) -N via leaching, and lowered rates of labile 
      organic N production. We also expected the chronic warming and watering would 
      lead to long-term changes in soil N-cycling that would be reflected in soil δ(15) 
      N values. We found that soil δ(15) N decreased under the different climate change 
      scenarios. Our results suggest that temperature accelerates biological processes 
      and existing C and N transformations, but moisture increases soil hydraulic 
      connectivity and so alters the pathways, and changes the fate of the products of 
      C and N transformations. In addition, our findings indicate that warmer, wetter 
      High Arctic tundra will be cycling N and C in ways that may transform these 
      landscapes in part leading to greater C sequestration, but simultaneously, N 
      losses from the upper soil profile that may be transported to depth dissolved in 
      water and or transported off site in lateral flow.

TI  - A U-Turn for Mercury Concentrations over 20 Years: How Do Environmental 
      Conditions Affect Exposure in Arctic Seabirds?
PG  - 2443-2454
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.1c07633 [doi]
AB  - Mercury (Hg) is highly toxic in its methylated form (MeHg), and global change is 
      likely to modify its bioavailability in the environment. However, it is unclear 
      how top predators will be impacted. We studied blood Hg concentrations of 
      chick-rearing black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla (2000-2019) in Svalbard 
      (Norway). From 2000 to 2019, Hg concentrations followed a U-shaped trend. The 
      trophic level, inferred from nitrogen stable isotopes, and chlorophyll a (Chl a) 
      concentrations better predicted Hg concentrations, with positive and U-shaped 
      associations, respectively. As strong indicators of primary productivity, Chl a 
      concentrations can influence production of upper trophic levels and, thus, fish 
      community assemblage. In the early 2000s, the high Hg concentrations were likely 
      related to a higher proportion of Arctic prey in kittiwake's diet. The gradual 
      input of Atlantic prey in kittiwake diet could have resulted in a decrease in Hg 
      concentrations until 2013. Then, a new shift in the prey community, added to the 
      shrinking sea ice-associated release of MeHg in the ocean, could explain the 
      increasing trend of Hg observed since 2014. The present monitoring provides 
      critical insights about the exposure of a toxic contaminant in Arctic wildlife, 
      and the reported increase since 2014 raises concern for Arctic seabirds.

TI  - Disparate movement behavior and feeding ecology in sympatric ecotypes of Atlantic 
      cod.
PG  - 11477-11490
LID - 10.1002/ece3.7939 [doi]
AB  - Coexistence of ecotypes, genetically divergent population units, is a widespread 
      phenomenon, potentially affecting ecosystem functioning and local food web 
      stability. In coastal Skagerrak, Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) occur as two such 
      coexisting ecotypes. We applied a combination of acoustic telemetry, genotyping, 
      and stable isotope analysis to 72 individuals to investigate movement ecology and 
      food niche of putative local "Fjord" and putative oceanic "North Sea" 
      ecotypes-thus named based on previous molecular studies. Genotyping and 
      individual origin assignment suggested 41 individuals were Fjord and 31 were 
      North Sea ecotypes. Both ecotypes were found throughout the fjord. Seven percent 
      of Fjord ecotype individuals left the study system during the study while 42% of 
      North Sea individuals left, potentially homing to natal spawning grounds. Home 
      range sizes were similar for the two ecotypes but highly variable among 
      individuals. Fjord ecotype cod had significantly higher δ(13)C and δ(15)N stable 
      isotope values than North Sea ecotype cod, suggesting they exploited different 
      food niches. The results suggest coexisting ecotypes may possess innate 
      differences in feeding and movement ecologies and may thus fill different 
      functional roles in marine ecosystems. This highlights the importance of 
      conserving interconnected populations to ensure stable ecosystem functioning and 
      food web structures.

AB  - How different functional responses of consumers exploiting pulsed resources 
      affect community dynamics is an ongoing question in ecology. Tree masting is a 
      common resource pulse in terrestrial ecosystems that can drive rodent population 
      cycles. Using stable isotope (δ(13)C, δ(15)N) analyses, we investigated the 
      dietary response of two fluctuating rodent species, the yellow-necked mouse 
      Apodemus flavicollis and the bank vole Myodes glareolus, to mast events in 
      Białowieża Forest (NE Poland). Rodent hair samples were obtained non-invasively 
      from faeces of their predators for an 11-year period that encompassed two mast 
      events. Spectacular seed crops of deciduous trees, namely oak Quercus robur and 
      hornbeam Carpinus betulus, occur after several intermediate years of moderate 
      seed production, with a post-mast year characterised by a nil crop. While a 
      Bayesian isotopic (SIAR) mixing model showed a variety of potential vegetation 
      inputs to rodent diets, the isotopic niche of the yellow-necked mouse was 
      strongly associated with mast of deciduous trees (>80% of diet), showing no 
      variation among years of different seed crop. However, bank voles showed a strong 
      functional response; in mast years the vole shifted its diet from herbs in 
      deciduous forest (~66% of diet) to mast (~74%). Only in mast years did the 
      isotopic niche of both rodent species overlap. Previous research showed that bank 
      voles, subordinate and more generalist than mice, showed higher fluctuations in 
      numbers in response to masting. This study provides unique data on the functional 
      response of key pulse consumers in forest food webs, and contributes to our 
      understanding of rodent population fluctuations and the mechanisms governing 
      pulse-consumer interactions.

AB  - Oxygen isotope signatures of transpiration (δ (E) ) are powerful tracers of water 
      movement from plant to global scale. However, a mechanistic understanding of how 
      leaf morphological/physiological traits effect δ (E) is missing. A laser 
      spectrometer was coupled to a leaf-level gas-exchange system to measure fluxes 
      and isotopic signatures of plant transpiration under controlled conditions in 
      seven distinct species (Fagus sylvatica, Pinus sylvestris, Acacia longifolia, 
      Quercus suber, Coffea arabica, Plantago lanceolata, Oxalis triangularis). We 
      analyzed the role of stomatal conductance (g(s) ) and leaf water content (W) on 
      the temporal dynamics of δ (E) following changes in relative humidity (rH). 
      Changes in rH were applied from 60 to 30% and from 30 to 60%, which is probably 
      more than covering the maximum step changes occurring under natural conditions. 
      Further, the impact of g(s) and W on isotopic non-steady state isofluxes was 
      analyzed. Following changes in rH, temporal development of δ (E) was well 
      described by a one-pool modeling approach for most species. Isofluxes of δ (E) 
      were dominantly driven by stomatal control on E, particularly for the initial 
      period of 30 min following a step change. Hence, the deviation of isofluxes from 
      isotopic steady state can be large, even though plants transpire near to isotopic 
      steady state. Notably, not only transpiration rate and stomatal conductance, but 
      also the leaf traits stomatal density (as a measure of g(max)) and leaf water 
      content are significantly related to the time constant (τ) and non-steady-state 
      isofluxes. This might provide an easy-to-access means of a priori assumptions for 
      the impact of isotopic non-steady-state transpiration in various ecosystems. We 
      discuss the implications of our results from leaf to ecosystem scale.

TI  - The effect of nutrients on carbon and nitrogen fixation by the UCYN-A-haptophyte 
      symbiosis.
PG  - 1635-47
LID - 10.1038/ismej.2014.253 [doi]
AB  - Symbiotic relationships between phytoplankton and N2-fixing microorganisms play a 
      crucial role in marine ecosystems. The abundant and widespread unicellular 
      cyanobacteria group A (UCYN-A) has recently been found to live symbiotically with 
      a haptophyte. Here, we investigated the effect of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), 
      iron (Fe) and Saharan dust additions on nitrogen (N2) fixation and primary 
      production by the UCYN-A-haptophyte association in the subtropical eastern North 
      Atlantic Ocean using nifH expression analysis and stable isotope incubations 
      combined with single-cell measurements. N2 fixation by UCYN-A was stimulated by 
      the addition of Fe and Saharan dust, although this was not reflected in the nifH 
      expression. CO2 fixation by the haptophyte was stimulated by the addition of 
      ammonium nitrate as well as Fe and Saharan dust. Intriguingly, the single-cell 
      analysis using nanometer scale secondary ion mass spectrometry indicates that the 
      increased CO2 fixation by the haptophyte in treatments without added fixed N is 
      likely an indirect result of the positive effect of Fe and/or P on UCYN-A N2 
      fixation and the transfer of N2-derived N to the haptophyte. Our results reveal a 
      direct linkage between the marine carbon and nitrogen cycles that is fuelled by 
      the atmospheric deposition of dust. The comparison of single-cell rates suggests 
      a tight coupling of nitrogen and carbon transfer that stays balanced even under 
      changing nutrient regimes. However, it appears that the transfer of carbon from 
      the haptophyte to UCYN-A requires a transfer of nitrogen from UCYN-A. This tight 
      coupling indicates an obligate symbiosis of this globally important diazotrophic 
      association.

AB  - Many remote montane ecosystems are experiencing biogeochemical changes driven by 
      warming climate and atmospheric pollution. Compared with circumpolar and 
      temperate lakes, the responses of subtropical montane lakes to these external 
      stressors have been less investigated. Here we present sedimentary multi-proxies 
      records (i.e. chironomids, elements and stable isotope of carbon and nitrogen) in 
      (210)Pb-dated cores from two montane ponds (central China). Before the 1900s, low 
      biomass and the dominance of opportunistic species (e.g. Chironomus 
      anthracinus-type) in both ponds might be in response to cold and harsh condition. 
      Thereafter, chironomid communities in both ponds experienced pronounced shifts. 
      Nutrient-tolerant/warm-adapted species (e.g. Chironomus sp., Polypedilum 
      nubeculosum-type and Endochironomus impar-type) proliferated and biomass 
      increased synchronously after the 1900s, suggestive of favorable condition for 
      chironomid growth. Redundancy analyses revealed that changes in chironomid 
      communities in both ponds were significantly correlated with rising temperature 
      and δ(15)N depletion. Prolonged growing season and nitrogen subsidy would 
      increase primary productivity, and hence enhancing food availability for 
      chironomids. Catchment-mediated indirect effects of warming and nitrogen 
      deposition, such as hydrological changes and terrestrial organic matter inputs, 
      would impose further influences on chironomid communities. Taken together, the 
      combined effects of climate warming and nitrogen deposition have caused 
      significant shifts in primary consumers of these montane ponds, and imposed 
      cascading effects on structure and function of subtropical montane aquatic 
      ecosystems.

AB  - Abstract  Human induced alterations to rivers and steams have resulted in 
      significant changes to the structure and diversity of riparian and aquatic plant 
      communities. These changes will impact on the dynamics of riverine carbon cycles 
      and food web structure and function. Here we investigate the principal sources of 
      organic carbon supporting local shredder communities across a gradient in 
      different levels of anthropogenic development along riverine reaches, in South 
      Australia. In forested/wooded reaches with minimum to limited development, 
      semi-emergent macrophytes were the principal sources of organic carbon supporting 
      the local shredder communities. However, in developed reaches, course particulate 
      organic matter and filamentous algae were the principal food sources. The C:N 
      ratios of the food sources in developed reaches were higher than those of their 
      consumers indicating a stoichiometric mismatch. This imbalanced consumer-resource 
      nutrient ratio in those developed reaches is likely to impose constraints on the 
      growth and reproduction of their aquatic shredder communities with probable 
      knock-on effects to higher trophic levels.

TI  - Does allochthony in lakes change across an elevation gradient?
PG  - 3281-91
AB  - Ecosystems are subsidized with inputs of mass and energy from their surroundings. 
      These allochthonous inputs regulate many ecosystem characteristics. In inland 
      waters, terrestrial inputs of organic matter regulate food-web structure, 
      ecosystem metabolism, water clarity, and thermal stratification. Future changes 
      in allochthony may be especially pronounced in high-elevation ecosystems due to 
      increases in vegetation and precipitation associated with climate change. Several 
      techniques exist to characterize the degree of allochthony of organic matter in 
      aquatic systems, including metrics such as ΔH, the net isotopic discrimination 
      between water and particulate organic matter (POM) of deuterium stable isotopes, 
      and the fluorescence index (FI), which characterizes the fluorescence of 
      dissolved organic matter (DOM). Despite the importance of allochthonous organic 
      carbon inputs, little is known about either how allochthony varies across 
      elevation gradients or whether different metrics are similarly related to 
      allochthony. We measured AH, FI, and a suite of related water-quality 
      characteristics in 30 lakes across a montane to alpine elevation gradient (2340 
      to 3205 m) in the Beartooth Mountains of Montana and Wyoming, USA, to understand 
      how FI and AH varied with elevation, with one another, and with other 
      allochthony-related water-quality characteristics. We hypothesized that 
      allochthony of POM and DOM would decrease at higher elevations, with alpine lakes 
      above treeline being more autochthonous compared with low-elevation lakes below 
      treeline. We observed a significant inverse linear relationship between AH and 
      Fl, with both metrics indicating a decrease in allochthony at higher elevations. 
      Characteristics including the natural log of the ratio of concentrations of 
      dissolved organic carbon to chlorophyll a (ln(DOC: Chl)), the spectral slope 
      ratio between different spectra of two wavebands (SR, ratio of spectra at 275-295 
      to 350-400 nm), and a ratio of diffuse attenuation coefficients at 320 and 380 nm 
      (KR, Kd320: Kd380) varied with both ΔH and FI while pH varied only with ΔH. 
      High-elevation systems were characterized by low ln(DOC: Chl) and K(R), and high 
      S(R) and pH. These results indicate that high-elevation lakes are more 
      autochthonous than low-elevation lakes. The relationships among ΔH, FI, 
      elevation, and other water-quality characteristics provide important insights to 
      understand future changes in carbon cycling in mountain ecosystems.

TI  - Toxaphene congeners in the Canadian Great Lakes basin: temporal and spatial food 
      web dynamics.
PG  - 1221-6
AB  - Samples of a top predator fish species, lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) and 
      predominant forage species including smelt (Osmerus mordax), alewife (Alosa 
      pseudoharengus), slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus), deepwater sculpin 
      (Myoxocephalus quadricornis) and lake herring (Coregonus artedii) were, collected 
      from throughout 4 of the 5 Great Lakes (Superior, Huron, Erie and Ontario) (Fig. 
      1). Lake trout were also collected from three isolated lake systems (Lakes 
      Nipigon, Simcoe and Opeongo), all located within the basin. All the samples were 
      analysed for body burdens of total toxaphene and 22 toxaphene congeners. In 
      addition, from each of the Great Lakes sites samples of major invertebrate 
      dietary items, which included Mysis relicta, Diporeia hoyi and plankton, were 
      similarly analysed. Whole lake trout samples, archived at -80 degrees C, were 
      reanalysed to determine historical trends of toxaphene congeners plus carbon and 
      nitrogen stable isotope signatures. The Lake Superior food web consistently had 
      the highest levels of total toxaphene of all the Great Lakes monitored. The 
      primary source of toxaphene to Lake Superior has been identified as atmospheric 
      transport and deposition from sites in the southern US, Mexico and Central 
      America (Hoff, R.M., Strachan, W.M.J., Sweet, C.W., Chan, C.H., Shackelton, M., 
      Bidleman, T.F., Brice, K.A., Burnison, D.A., Cussion, S., Gatz, D.F., Harlin, K., 
      Schroeder, W.H., 1996. Atmospheric deposition of toxic chemicals to the Great 
      Lakes: A review of data through 1994. Atmospheric Environ. 30, 3505-3527). Of the 
      offsystem lakes surveyed. Lake Nipigon, situated due north of Lake Superior and 
      with a Lake Basin area of about 6% of Lake Superior (Hendendorf, C.E., 1982. J. 
      Great Lakes Res. 8(3), 379-412) had total toxaphene levels in lake trout 
      equivalent to about 50% of those found in lake trout from Lake Superior. Temporal 
      trend toxaphene congener analysis was conducted on archived whole fish samples 
      collected over the period 1980 through to the 1990's. Initially a 
      nonachlorobornane congener (Parlar #50) was predominant, with congeners #40, #62 
      and #21 being the next most prominent in the 1980 samples. Samples from the 
      1990's showed a significant decline in the presence of lower chlorinated 
      congeners #40 and #21. Analysis of total toxaphene in food webs, indicated 
      elevated levels in lower trophic level species such as Diporeia and Cottus sp. 
      which have a benthic association. The stable isotope temporal trend 13C signature 
      identified a significant shift in the lake trout diet over the period 1993 to 
      1996.

TI  - Using DNA-based stable isotope probing to reveal novel propionate- and 
      acetate-oxidizing bacteria in propionate-fed mesophilic anaerobic chemostats.
PG  - 17396

LID - 17396
AB  - Propionate is one of the most important intermediates of anaerobic fermentation. 
      Its oxidation performed by syntrophic propionate-oxidizing bacteria coupled with 
      hydrogenotrophic methanogens is considered to be a rate-limiting step for methane 
      production. However, the current understanding of SPOB is limited due to the 
      difficulty of pure culture isolation. In the present study, two anaerobic 
      chemostats fed with propionate as the sole carbon source were operated at 
      different dilution rates (0.05 d(-1) and 0.15 d(-1)). The propionate- and 
      acetate-oxidizing bacteria in the two methanogenic chemostats were investigated 
      combining DNA-stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) and 16S rRNA gene high-throughput 
      sequencing. The results of DNA-SIP with (13)C-propionate/acetate suggested that, 
      Smithella, Syntrophobacter, Cryptanaerobacter, and unclassified Rhodospirillaceae 
      may be putative propionate-oxidizing bacteria; unclassified Spirochaetaceae, 
      unclassified Synergistaceae, unclassified Elusimicrobia, Mesotoga, and 
      Gracilibacter may contribute to acetate oxidation; unclassified Syntrophaceae and 
      Syntrophomonas may be butyrate oxidizers. By DNA-SIP, unclassified OTUs with 16S 
      rRNA gene abundance higher than 62% of total Bacteria in the PL chemostat and 38% 
      in the PH chemostat were revealed to be related to the degradation of propionate. 
      These results suggest that a variety of uncultured bacteria contribute to 
      propionate degradation during anaerobic digestion. The functions and metabolic 
      characteristics of these bacteria require further investigation.

TI  - Sulfidic Habitats in the Gypsum Karst System of Monte Conca (Italy) Host a 
      Chemoautotrophically Supported Invertebrate Community.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19052671 [doi]
LID - 2671
AB  - The great diversity of the invertebrate community thriving in the deepest 
      sections of the gypsum karst system of the Monte Conca sinkhole (Sicily, Italy) 
      suggests the existence of a complex food web associated with a sulfidic pool and 
      chemoautotrophic microbial activity. To shed light on the peculiarity of this 
      biological assemblage, we investigated the species composition of the 
      invertebrate community and surveyed trophic interactions by stable isotope 
      analysis. The faunal investigation conducted by visual censuses and hand sampling 
      methods led to the discovery of a structured biological assemblage composed of 
      both subterranean specialized and non-specialized species, encompassing all 
      trophic levels. The community was remarkably diverse in the sulfidic habitat and 
      differed from other non-sulfidic habitats within the cave in terms of stable 
      isotope ratios. This pattern suggests the presence of a significant 
      chemoautotrophic support by the microbial communities to the local food web, 
      especially during the dry season when the organic input from the surface is 
      minimal. However, when large volumes of water enter the cave due to local 
      agricultural activities (i.e., irrigation) or extreme precipitation events, the 
      sulfidic habitat of the cave is flooded, inhibiting the local autotrophic 
      production and threatening the conservation of the entire ecosystem.

      white-tailed sea eagles from Germany: Implications for prioritisation and future 
      risk management.

AB  - The increasing use of chemicals in the European Union (EU) has resulted in 
      environmental emissions and wildlife exposures. For approving a chemical within 
      the EU, producers need to conduct an environmental risk assessment, which 
      typically relies on data generated under laboratory conditions without 
      considering the ecological and landscape context. To address this gap and add 
      information on emerging contaminants and chemical mixtures, we analysed 30 livers 
      of white-tailed sea eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla) from northern Germany with high 
      resolution-mass spectrometry coupled to liquid and gas chromatography for the 
      identification of >2400 contaminants. We then modelled the influence of trophic 
      position (δ(15)N), habitat (δ(13)C) and landscape on chemical residues and 
      screened for persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) properties using an in 
      silico model to unravel mismatches between predicted PBT properties and observed 
      exposures. Despite having generally low PBT scores, most detected contaminants 
      were medicinal products with oxfendazole and salicylamide being most frequent. 
      Chemicals of the Stockholm Convention such as 4,4'-DDE and PCBs were present in 
      all samples below toxicity thresholds. Among PFAS, especially PFOS showed 
      elevated concentrations compared to other studies. In contrast, PFCA levels were 
      low and increased with δ(15)N, which indicated an increase with preying on 
      piscivorous species. Among plant protection products, spiroxamine and simazine 
      were frequently detected with increasing concentrations in agricultural 
      landscapes. The in silico model has proven to be reliable for predicting PBT 
      properties for most chemicals. However, chemical exposures in apex predators are 
      complex and do not solely rely on intrinsic chemical properties but also on other 
      factors such as ecology and landscape. We therefore recommend that ecological 
      contexts, mixture toxicities, and chemical monitoring data should be more 
      frequently considered in regulatory risk assessments, e.g. in a weight of 
      evidence approach, to trigger risk management measures before adverse effects in 
      individuals or populations start to manifest.

TI  - Environmental Control on Microbial Turnover of Leaf Carbon in Streams - 
      Ecological Function of Phototrophic-Heterotrophic Interactions.

AB  - In aquatic ecosystems, light availability can significantly influence microbial 
      turnover of terrestrial organic matter through associated metabolic interactions 
      between phototrophic and heterotrophic communities. However, particularly in 
      streams, microbial functions vary significantly with the structure of the 
      streambed, that is the distribution and spatial arrangement of sediment grains in 
      the streambed. It is therefore essential to elucidate how environmental factors 
      synergistically define the microbial turnover of terrestrial organic matter in 
      order to better understand the ecological role of photo-heterotrophic 
      interactions in stream ecosystem processes. In outdoor experimental streams, we 
      examined how the structure of streambeds modifies the influence of light 
      availability on microbial turnover of leaf carbon (C). Furthermore, we 
      investigated whether the studied relationships of microbial leaf C turnover to 
      environmental conditions are affected by flow intermittency commonly occurring in 
      streams. We applied leaves enriched with a (13)C-stable isotope tracer and 
      combined quantitative and isotope analyses. We thereby elucidated whether 
      treatment induced changes in C turnover were associated with altered use of leaf 
      C within the microbial food web. Moreover, isotope analyses were combined with 
      measurements of microbial community composition to determine whether changes in 
      community function were associated with a change in community composition. In 
      this study, we present evidence, that environmental factors interactively 
      determine how phototrophs and heterotrophs contribute to leaf C turnover. Light 
      availability promoted the utilization of leaf C within the microbial food web, 
      which was likely associated with a promoted availability of highly bioavailable 
      metabolites of phototrophic origin. However, our results additionally confirm 
      that the structure of the streambed modifies light-related changes in microbial C 
      turnover. From our observations, we conclude that the streambed structure 
      influences the strength of photo-heterotrophic interactions by defining the 
      spatial availability of algal metabolites in the streambed and the composition of 
      microbial communities. Collectively, our multifactorial approach provides 
      valuable insights into environmental controls on the functioning of stream 
      ecosystems.

TI  - Soil moisture drives differences in the diversity and trophic complexity of high 
      Arctic tundra soils.
LID - fiad050 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/femsec/fiad050 [doi]
AB  - The Arctic soil communities play a vital role in stabilizing and decomposing soil 
      carbon, which affects the global carbon cycling. Studying the food web structure 
      is critical for understanding biotic interactions and the functioning of these 
      ecosystems. Here, we studied the trophic relationships of (microscopic) soil 
      biota of two different Arctic spots in Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, within a natural 
      soil moisture gradient by combining DNA analysis with stable isotopes as trophic 
      tracers. The results of our study suggested that the soil moisture strongly 
      influenced the diversity of soil biota, with the wetter soil, having a higher 
      organic matter content, hosting a more diverse community. Based on a Bayesian 
      mixing model, the community of wet soil formed a more complex food web, in which 
      bacterivorous and detritivorous pathways were important in supplying carbon and 
      energy to the upper trophic levels. In contrast, the drier soil showed a less 
      diverse community, lower trophic complexity, with the green food web (via 
      unicellular green algae and gatherer organisms) playing a more important role in 
      channelling energy to higher trophic levels. These findings are important to 
      better understand the soil communities inhabiting the Arctic, and for predicting 
      how the ecosystem will respond to the forthcoming changes in precipitation 
      regimes.

TI  - The influence of climate and habitat on stable isotope signatures and the 
      isotopic niche of nestling White-headed Woodpeckers (Dryobates albolarvatus).
PG  - 9827-9840
LID - 10.1002/ece3.6624 [doi]
AB  - The majority of landbird species feed their nestlings arthropods and variation in 
      arthropod populations can impact reproductive outcomes in these species. 
      Arthropod populations in turn are influenced by climate because temperature 
      affects survival and reproduction, and larval development. Thus, climate factors 
      have the potential to influence many bird species during their reproductive 
      phases. In this study, we assessed climate factors that impact the diet of 
      nestling White-headed Woodpecker (Dryobates albolarvatus), an at-risk keystone 
      species in much of its range in western North America. To do this, we measured 
      stable isotope signatures (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) in 152 nestlings across six years 
      and linked variation in isotopic values to winter (December-February) and spring 
      (June) precipitation and temperature using mixed effects models. We also explored 
      habitat factors that may impact δ(13)C and δ(15)N and the relationship between 
      δ(15)N and nest productivity. Last, we estimated isotopic niche width for 
      nestlings in different watersheds and years using Bayesian standard ellipses, 
      which allowed us to compare dietary niche width and overlap. We found that colder 
      winter temperatures were associated with an increase in δ(15)N and δ(15)N levels 
      had a weak positive relationship with nest productivity. We also found that sites 
      with a more diverse tree community were associated with a broader isotopic niche 
      width in nestlings. Our findings suggest that nestling diet is affected by 
      climate, and under future warming climate scenarios, White-headed Woodpecker 
      nestling diet may shift in favor of lower trophic level prey (prey with lower 
      δ(15)N levels). The impact of such changes on woodpecker populations merits 
      further study.

TI  - Allocation of freshly assimilated carbon into primary and secondary metabolites 
      after in situ ¹³C pulse labelling of Norway spruce (Picea abies).
PG  - 1176-91
LID - 10.1093/treephys/tpv083 [doi]
AB  - Plants allocate carbon (C) to sink tissues depending on phenological, 
      physiological or environmental factors. We still have little knowledge on C 
      partitioning into various cellular compounds and metabolic pathways at various 
      ecophysiological stages. We used compound-specific stable isotope analysis to 
      investigate C partitioning of freshly assimilated C into tree compartments 
      (needles, branches and stem) as well as into needle water-soluble organic C 
      (WSOC), non-hydrolysable structural organic C (stOC) and individual chemical 
      compound classes (amino acids, hemicellulose sugars, fatty acids and alkanes) of 
      Norway spruce (Picea abies) following in situ (13)C pulse labelling 15 days after 
      bud break. The (13)C allocation within the above-ground tree biomass demonstrated 
      needles as a major C sink, accounting for 86% of the freshly assimilated C 6 h 
      after labelling. In needles, the highest allocation occurred not only into the 
      WSOC pool (44.1% of recovered needle (13)C) but also into stOC (33.9%). Needle 
      growth, however, also caused high (13)C allocation into pathways not involved in 
      the formation of structural compounds: (i) pathways in secondary metabolism, (ii) 
      C-1 metabolism and (iii) amino acid synthesis from photorespiration. These 
      pathways could be identified by a high (13)C enrichment of their key amino acids. 
      In addition, (13)C was strongly allocated into the n-alkyl lipid fraction (0.3% 
      of recovered (13)C), whereby (13)C allocation into cellular and cuticular 
      exceeded that of epicuticular fatty acids. (13)C allocation decreased along the 
      lipid transformation and translocation pathways: the allocation was highest for 
      precursor fatty acids, lower for elongated fatty acids and lowest for the 
      decarbonylated n-alkanes. The combination of (13)C pulse labelling with 
      compound-specific (13)C analysis of key metabolites enabled tracing relevant C 
      allocation pathways under field conditions. Besides the primary metabolism 
      synthesizing structural cell compounds, a complex network of pathways consumed 
      the assimilated (13)C and kept most of the assimilated C in the growing needles.

AB  - Exploitation and changing ocean conditions have resulted in altered species 
      interactions and varied population dynamics within marine fish communities off 
      northeast Newfoundland and southern Labrador, Canada. To understand contemporary 
      species interactions, we quantified the isotopic niches, niche overlap, and 
      ontogenetic niche change among seven dominant fish species using stable isotope 
      analyses. Analyses used fishes from three regions differing in fish and prey 
      diversities. Differences in fish and diet composition diversity among regions 
      were found using Simpson's inverse diversity index. The regions of lowest 
      diversities had higher instances of niche overlap and higher percentage of niche 
      overlap area. The region of highest diversity had the widest spread of niches 
      with greater distances from the community centroid. Ontogenetic shifts were 
      observed such that larger individuals shifted towards the community centroid with 
      the exception of Atlantic cod. Atlantic cod in particular was found to 
      consistently be the top predator of the analyzed species. Our results reveal: (a) 
      overlap in isotopic niches and spread within niche space was correlated with fish 
      and diet diversity; (b) ontogenetic shifts are important when considering a 
      species' niche and quantifying spatial variation in community niche profiles.

AB  - Anthropogenic land-use change alters wildlife habitats and modifies species 
      composition, diversity, and contacts among wildlife, livestock, and humans. Such 
      human-modified ecosystems have been associated with emerging infectious diseases, 
      threatening human and animal health. However, human disturbance also creates new 
      resources that some species can exploit. Common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) 
      in Latin America constitute an important example, as their adaptation to 
      human-modified habitats and livestock blood-feeding has implications for e.g., 
      rabies transmission. Despite the well-known links between habitat degradation and 
      disease emergence, few studies have explored how human-induced disturbance 
      influences wildlife behavioural ecology and health, which can alter disease 
      dynamics. To evaluate links among habitat disturbance, diet shifts, gut 
      microbiota, and immunity, we quantified disturbance around roosting caves of 
      common vampire bats in Costa Rica, measured their long-term diet preferences 
      (livestock or wildlife blood) using stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen, 
      evaluated innate and adaptive immune markers, and characterized their gut 
      microbiota. We observed that bats from roosting caves with more cattle farming 
      nearby fed more on cattle blood. Moreover, gut microbial richness and the 
      abundance of specific gut microbes differed according to feeding preferences. 
      Interestingly, bats feeding primarily on wildlife blood harboured a higher 
      abundance of the bacteria Edwardsiella sp., which tended to be associated with 
      higher immunoglobulin G levels. Our results highlight how human land-use change 
      may indirectly affect wildlife health and emerging infectious diseases through 
      diet-induced shifts in microbiota, with implications for host immunity and 
      potential consequences for susceptibility to pathogens.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Species-specific strategies for financing the costs of reproduction 
      are well understood, forming a continuum ranging from high to low reliance on 
      stored nutrients. Animals relying mostly on stored reserves are termed 'capital 
      breeders', whereas 'income breeders' rely mostly on concurrent intake when 
      financing the costs of reproduction. The role and adaptive value of individual 
      variation in these strategies remain elusive. Life-history theory posits that 
      capital breeding should be favoured when offspring reproductive value peaks, 
      typically occurring early in the season, and that current income should 
      increasingly be used with progressing season. Because resource limitation may 
      hamper flexible resource allocation, a corollary prediction is that only 
      good-condition individuals may show the expected seasonal shift in resource use. 
      To test this prediction, we examined stable isotopes (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) in blood 
      and lipid-free egg yolk of breeding eider females (Somateria mollissima) from the 
      Baltic Sea to assess the role of individual variation in the use of proteins from 
      local diet vs. stored reserves. RESULTS: We show for the first time that 
      individuals from a single population differ in their utilization of stored 
      reserves and concurrent intake to finance the costs of reproduction. Consistent 
      with our prediction, heavy females predominantly used stored reserves for 
      producing egg yolks early in the season, increasingly relying on local feeding 
      with later onset of breeding, whereas light females showed no seasonal change in 
      allocation strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Stable isotope profiling at the individual 
      level is a powerful tool for monitoring relative changes in investment strategies 
      through time, showing promise as an early warning indicator of ecological change 
      in food webs.

AB  - Isotopic measurements on junipers growing in southern California during the last 
      glacial, when the ambient atmospheric [CO(2)] (c(a)) was ~180 ppm, show the 
      leaf-internal [CO(2)] (c(i)) was approaching the modern CO(2) compensation point 
      for C(3) plants. Despite this, stem growth rates were similar to today. Using a 
      coupled light-use efficiency and tree growth model, we show that it is possible 
      to maintain a stable c(i)/c(a) ratio because both vapour pressure deficit and 
      temperature were decreased under glacial conditions at La Brea, and these have 
      compensating effects on the c(i)/c(a) ratio. Reduced photorespiration at lower 
      temperatures would partly mitigate the effect of low c(i) on gross primary 
      production, but maintenance of present-day radial growth also requires a ~27% 
      reduction in the ratio of fine root mass to leaf area. Such a shift was possible 
      due to reduced drought stress under glacial conditions at La Brea. The necessity 
      for changes in allocation in response to changes in [CO(2)] is consistent with 
      increased below-ground allocation, and the apparent homoeostasis of radial 
      growth, as c(a) increases today.

AB  - To evaluate the effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation on energy acquisition and 
      consumption, the copepod Paracyclopina nana was irradiated with several doses 
      (0-3kJ/m(2)) of UV. After UV radiation, we measured the re-brooding success, 
      growth pattern of newly hatched nauplii, ingestion rate, and assimilation of 
      diet. In addition, we checked the modulated patterns of DNA repair and heat shock 
      protein (hsp) chaperoning genes of P. nana. UV-B radiation induced a significant 
      reduction (7-87%) of the re-brooding rate of ovigerous females, indicating that 
      UV-induced egg sac damage is closely correlated with a reduction in the hatching 
      rate of UV-irradiated ovigerous female offspring. Using chlorophyll a and stable 
      carbon isotope incubation experiments, we found a dose-dependent decrease 
      (P<0.05) in food ingestion and the rate of assimilation to the body in response 
      to UV radiation, implying that P. nana has an underlying ability to shift its 
      balanced-energy status from growth and reproduction to DNA repair and adaptation. 
      Also, expression of P. nana base excision repair (BER)-associated genes and hsp 
      chaperoning genes was significantly increased in response to UV radiation in P. 
      nana. These findings indicate that even 1kJ/m(2) of UV radiation induces a 
      reduction in reproduction and growth patterns, alters the physiological balance 
      and inhibits the ability to cope with UV-induced damage in P. nana.

TI  - Dietary shift of an invasive predator: rats, seabirds and sea turtles.
PG  - 428-437
AB  - Rats have reached about 80% of the world's islands and are among the most 
      successful invasive mammals. Rats are opportunistic predators that are notorious 
      for their impact on a variety of animal and plant species. However, little 
      documented evidence on the complexities of these interactions is available.In our 
      study, we assessed the impact of black rats Rattus rattus introduced on a small 
      uninhabited island with a relatively simple ecosystem, Surprise Island, New 
      Caledonia. We also compared the diet of R. rattus in the presence and absence of 
      breeding seabirds, assessing the dietary compensation for this potentially 
      important food source. From 2002 to 2005, we used live trapping studies combined 
      with stable isotope analysis and conventional diet analyses (direct observations, 
      gut and faecal contents) to characterize the diet of rats.Our results suggest a 
      heavy predatory impact on seabirds, which could constitute as much as 24% of the 
      rat diet. Moreover, in the absence of birds, rats compensated marginally by 
      preying more heavily on other components of their diet but mostly acquired a new 
      resource. They shifted their diet by preying heavily upon another endangered 
      species, the hatchlings of sea turtles Chelonia mydas, which could constitute the 
      main resource in the diet of R. rattus in those periods. Abundance, body 
      condition and distribution of the rats were consistent with heavy predation upon 
      this additional resource.Synthesis and applications. In island ecosystems 
      invasive rats prey mainly upon seabird eggs and chicks, thereby threatening their 
      populations. Although rats are certainly capable of surviving on terrestrial 
      foods outside the seabird nesting season, their ability to prey upon ephemeral 
      but abundant resources, such as hatchling sea turtles, may contribute to 
      maintaining their populations. This may explain their success on Surprise Island, 
      an ecosystem of extreme conditions, and suggests that biologists and managers 
      working with threatened species should be aware of the possibility of temporary 
      diet shifts by introduced rodents that may cause unexpected heavy predation on 
      these species. This dietary shift from one endangered taxa to another has major 
      implications for the conservation of seabirds and sea turtles world-wide and more 
      generally for the biodiversity of invaded insular communities.

AB  - Urban-dwelling species present feeding and behavioural innovation that enable 
      them to adjust to anthropogenic food subsidies available in cities. In 2020, the 
      SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak resulted in unprecedented reduction in the human 
      activity worldwide associated with the human lockdown. This situation opened an 
      excellent opportunity to investigate the capability of urban wildlife to cope 
      with this anthropopause event. Here, we investigated the effects of the COVID-19 
      lockdown on the feeding strategies of the urban yellow-legged gull (Larus 
      michahellis) population inhabiting the highly dense city of Barcelona (NE Spain). 
      We compared the diet of chicks (through stomach content and stable isotope 
      analyses) sampled randomly around the city of Barcelona before (2018 and 2019), 
      during (2020) and after (2021) the COVID-19 lockdown. The results revealed that 
      the anthropopause associated with the lockdown had an effect on the diet of this 
      urban-dwelling predator. The diversity of prey consumed during the lockdown was 
      lower, and consumption of urban birds (pigeons and parakeets) and marine prey 
      (fishery discards and natural prey) decreased during the year of lockdown. 
      Although it was not analysed, these diet changes probably were associated with 
      variations in the availability of these resources due to the decrease in human 
      activity during the lockdown. These results demonstrate the trophic flexibility 
      of urban-dwelling species to cope with the changes in the availability of 
      human-related anthropogenic resources in urban marine ecosystems.

TI  - Integrating multiple chemical tracers to elucidate the diet and habitat of 
      Cookiecutter Sharks.

AB  - The Cookiecutter shark (Isistius brasiliensis) is an ectoparasitic, mesopelagic 
      shark that is known for removing plugs of tissue from larger prey, including 
      teleosts, chondrichthyans, cephalopods, and marine mammals. Although this species 
      is widely distributed throughout the world's tropical and subtropical oceanic 
      waters, like many deep-water species, it remains very poorly understood due to 
      its mesopelagic distribution. We used a suite of biochemical tracers, including 
      stable isotope analysis (SIA), fatty acid analysis (FAA), and environmental DNA 
      (eDNA), to investigate the trophic ecology of this species in the Central Pacific 
      around Hawaii. We found that large epipelagic prey constituted a relatively minor 
      part of the overall diet. Surprisingly, small micronektonic and forage species 
      (meso- and epipelagic) are the most important prey group for Cookiecutter sharks 
      across the studied size range (17-43 cm total length), with larger mesopelagic 
      species or species that exhibit diel vertical migration also being important 
      prey. These results were consistent across all the tracer techniques employed. 
      Our results indicate that Cookiecutter sharks play a unique role in pelagic food 
      webs, feeding on prey ranging from the largest apex predators to small, low 
      trophic level species, in particular those that overlap with the depth 
      distribution of the sharks throughout the diel cycle. We also found evidence of a 
      potential shift in diet and/or habitat with size and season. Environmental DNA 
      metabarcoding revealed new prey items for Cookiecutter sharks while also 
      demonstrating that eDNA can be used to identify recent prey in stomachs frozen 
      for extended periods. Integrating across chemical tracers is a powerful tool for 
      investigating the ecology of elusive and difficult to study species, such as 
      meso- and bathypelagic chondrichthyans, and can increase the amount of 
      information gained from small sample sizes. Better resolving the foraging ecology 
      of these mesopelagic predators is critical for effective conservation and 
      management of these taxa and ecosystems, which are intrinsically vulnerable to 
      overfishing and exploitation.

TI  - Ecotoxicology of mercury concentrations in arctic lamprey (Lethenteron 
      camtschaticum).

AB  - Arctic lamprey (Lethenteron camtschaticum) is an important dietary resource for 
      rural and indigenous communities in parts of Alaska, with some commercial use. As 
      with many fish species harvested for human consumption, there are concerns 
      regarding mercury concentrations ([Hg]) in Arctic lamprey that may impact human 
      health. To date, information regarding the life cycle and diet of Arctic lamprey 
      is scarce, with no published studies examining [Hg] in Arctic lamprey tissues. 
      Our goals were to investigate the feeding ecology of Arctic lamprey from the 
      Bering Sea, determine how diet and potential dietary shifts might influence [Hg] 
      in muscle, and determine if current [Hg] may pose a human health risk. The mean 
      total [Hg] in Arctic lamprey muscle (n = 98) was 19 ng/g wet-weight. Log 
      transformed total [Hg] were not associated with any measured biological variables 
      including length, mass, δ(13)C values, or δ(15)N values. A stable isotope mixing 
      model estimated that capelin (Mallotus villosus) accounted for 40.0 ± 4.0% of the 
      Arctic lamprey diet, while Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus) and Pacific 
      herring (Clupea pallasii) accounted for 37.8 ± 3.1% and 22.2 ± 3.5% respectively. 
      Finally, diet percentage compositions shifted based on size class (i.e., medium 
      versus large). These results indicated that feeding location, bioaccumulation, 
      and biomagnification are not important drivers of [Hg] in Arctic lamprey and 
      current [Hg] do not pose a human health risk. Taken together, this research 
      further expands our knowledge of Arctic lamprey trophic ecology in the eastern 
      Bering Sea.

TI  - Energy acquisition strategy for reproduction in a semelparous squid.
PG  - 28
LID - 10.1186/s12983-022-00473-w [doi]
LID - 28
AB  - BACKGROUND: Energy demand for reproduction leads to a wide diversity of foraging 
      and life-history strategy among wild animals, linking to a common objective to 
      maximize reproductive success. Semelparous squid species in particular can use up 
      to 50% of the total energy intake for reproduction. However, the energy 
      acquisition strategy for reproduction is still a controversial issue regarding 
      whether the squid shift in diet ontogenetically. Here we used Argentinean 
      shortfin squid (Illex argentinus) as a case study to investigate the strategy of 
      energy acquisition for reproduction, by analyzing energy density of the squid's 
      reproductive tissues including ovary, nidamental glands and oviduct eggs, and 
      stable isotopes and fatty acids of the squid's ovary. RESULTS: The reproductive 
      energy (the sum of the energy accumulated in ovary, nidamental glands and oviduct 
      eggs) increased significantly with maturation. The ovary nitrogen stable isotopes 
      (δ(15)N) showed a significant increase with maturation, but the increase by 
      maturity stage was not equal to the typical enrichment of about 3‰ per trophic 
      level. Isotopic niche width showed an increasing trend with maturation, and 
      isotopic niche space exhibited greater overlap at advanced maturity stages. The 
      relative amounts of 16:0, 20:5n3 and 20:4n6 in the ovary, tracing for carnivores 
      and top predators, increased after the onset of maturation. The overall fatty 
      acid profiles of the ovary showed significant differences among maturity stages, 
      but obvious overlaps were found for mature squids. Mixed-effects model results 
      revealed that reproductive energy was positively correlated with δ(15)N values. 
      The reproductive energy was also positively related to the relative amounts of 
      18:0 and 20:4n6, respectively tracing for herbivores and top predators. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results validate that the squid shifts to feed on higher trophic 
      prey for reproduction as energy demand increases once maturation commences. 
      However, the squid does not shift feeding habits at a trophic level but instead 
      broadens prey spectrum, coupled with increasing intake of higher trophic prey 
      items, to meet the energy demand for reproduction. Such energy acquisition 
      strategy may be selected by the squid to maximize reproductive success by 
      balancing energy intake and expenditure from foraging, warranting future studies 
      that aim to clarify such strategy for reproduction among semelparous species.

PG  - 109-119
LID - 10.1007/s004420050766 [doi]
AB  - Concentration and isotopic composition (δ(13)C and δ(18)O) of ambient CO(2) and 
      water vapour were determined within a Quercus petraea canopy, Northumberland, UK. 
      From continuous measurements made across a 36-h period from three heights within 
      the forest canopy, we generated mixing lines (Keeling plots) for δ(a)(13)CO(2), 
      δ(a) C(18)O(16)O and δ(a) H(2)(18)O, to derive the isotopic composition of the 
      signal being released from forest to atmosphere. These were compared directly 
      with measurements of different respective pools within the forest system, i.e. 
      δ(13)C of organic matter input for δ(a)(13)CO(2), δ(18)O of exchangeable water 
      for δ(a) C(18)O(16)O and transpired water vapour for δ(a) H(2)(18)O. [CO(2)] and 
      δ(a)(13)CO(2) showed strong coupling, where the released CO(2) was, on average, 4 
      per mil enriched compared to the organic matter of plant material in the system, 
      suggesting either fractionation of organic material before eventual release as 
      soil-respired CO(2), or temporal differences in ecosystem discrimination. δ(a) 
      C(18)O(16)O was less well coupled to [CO(2)], probably due to the heterogeneity 
      and transient nature of water pools (soil, leaf and moss) within the forest. 
      Similarly, δ(a) H(2)(18)O was less coupled to [H(2)O], again reflecting the 
      transient nature of water transpired to the forest, seen as uncoupling during 
      times of large changes in vapour pressure deficit. The δ(18)O of transpired water 
      vapour, inferred from both mixing lines at the canopy scale and direct 
      measurement at the leaf level, approximated that of source water, confirming that 
      an isotopic steady state held for the forest integrated over the daily cycle. 
      This demonstrates that isotopic coupling of CO(2) and water vapour within a 
      forest canopy will depend on absolute differences in the isotopic composition of 
      the respective pools involved in exchange and on the stability of each of these 
      pools with time.

AB  - Microbial communities drive soil ecosystem function but are also susceptible to 
      environmental disturbances. We investigated whether exposure to manure sourced 
      from cattle either administered or not administered antibiotics affected 
      microbially mediated terrestrial ecosystem function. We quantified changes in 
      microbial community composition via amplicon sequencing, and terrestrial 
      elemental cycling via a stable isotope pulse-chase. Exposure to manure from 
      antibiotic-treated cattle caused: (i) changes in microbial community structure; 
      and (ii) alterations in elemental cycling throughout the terrestrial system. This 
      exposure caused changes in fungal : bacterial ratios, as well as changes in 
      bacterial community structure. Additionally, exposure to manure from cattle 
      treated with pirlimycin resulted in an approximate two-fold increase in ecosystem 
      respiration of recently fixed-carbon, and a greater proportion of recently added 
      nitrogen in plant and soil pools compared to the control manure. Manure from 
      antibiotic-treated cattle therefore affects terrestrial ecosystem function via 
      the soil microbiome, causing decreased ecosystem carbon use efficiency, and 
      altered nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Allochthonous aquatic subsidies alleviate predation pressure in terrestrial 
      ecosystems.
PG  - e03074
LID - 10.1002/ecy.3074 [doi]
AB  - The input of external energy and matter in recipient ecosystems can act as a 
      bottom-up force that subsidizes consumers, with subsequent cascading effects 
      throughout the food web. Depending on the amount of input, dietary preference, 
      and the strength of trophic links, allochthonous resources generally play a 
      stabilizing role on food webs. In this study, we investigated the stabilizing 
      role of allochthonous aquatic resources on intraguild predation (IGP) and their 
      consequences on shared prey in a terrestrial ecosystem. To this end, we 
      manipulated the input of emergent aquatic insects (the allochthonous resources) 
      from streams to land, and predation pressure by bats and birds (the top 
      predators), in a multitrophic food web using an orthogonal exclusion experiment. 
      Using stable isotope metrics, we found that bats, birds, and spiders (the 
      mesopredators), were highly subsidized by emergent aquatic insects. Moreover, 
      among terrestrial prey, top predators fed more on spiders than insects. As 
      predicted, spiders were strongly affected by the presence of top predators when 
      allochthonous resources were excluded. Consequently, in this scenario terrestrial 
      insects were two times more abundant. Because spiders showed a higher preference 
      for consuming aquatic resources, we suggest that nonconsumptive effects of 
      spiders upon terrestrial insects could be mediating the strong response of those 
      shared prey. We demonstrate that the input of allochthonous aquatic resources can 
      play a fundamental role in stabilizing terrestrial trophic interactions and 
      trophic cascades in riparian zones via decreasing predation pressure.

TI  - Body size is negatively correlated with trophic position among cyprinids.
PG  - 150652
LID - 10.1098/rsos.150652 [doi]
LID - 150652
AB  - Body size has many ecological and evolutionary implications that extend across 
      multiple levels of organization. Body size is often positively correlated with 
      species traits such as metabolism, prey size and trophic position (TP) due to 
      physiological and mechanical constraints. We used stable isotope analysis to 
      quantify TP among minnows across multiple assemblages that differed in their 
      species composition, diversity and food web structure. Body size significantly 
      predicted TP across different lineages and assemblages, and indicated a 
      significant negative relationship. The observed negative relationship between 
      body size and TP is contrary to conventional knowledge, and is likely to have 
      arisen owing to highly clade-specific patterns, such that clades consist of 
      either large benthic species or small pelagic species. Cyprinids probably subvert 
      the physiological and mechanical constraints that generally produce a positive 
      relationship between body size and TP using anatomical modifications and by 
      consuming small-bodied prey, respectively. The need for herbivorous cyprinids to 
      digest cellulose-rich foods probably selected for larger bodies to accommodate 
      longer intestinal tracts and thereby to facilitate digestion of nutrient-poor 
      resources, such as algae. Therefore, body size and TP are likely to have 
      coevolved in cyprinids in association with specialization along the benthic to 
      pelagic resource axis.

TI  - Ecological data for western Indian Ocean tuna.
PG  - 1245
LID - 10.1002/ecy.2218 [doi]
AB  - Tuna are marine apex predators that inhabit the tropical and sub-tropical waters 
      of the Indian Ocean where they support socially and economically important 
      fisheries. Key component of pelagic communities, tuna are bioindicator species of 
      anthropogenic and climate-induced changes through modifications of the structure 
      and related energy-flow of food webs and ecosystems. The IndianEcoTuna dataset 
      provides a panel of ecological tracers measured in four soft tissues (white 
      muscle, red muscle, liver, gonads) from 1,364 individuals of four species, i.e., 
      the albacore (ALB, Thunnus alalunga), the bigeye (BET, T. obesus), the skipjack 
      (SKJ, Katsuwomus pelamis), and the yellowfin (YFT, T. albacares), collected 
      throughout the western Indian Ocean from 2009 to 2015. Sampling was carried out 
      during routine monitoring programs, at sea by observers onboard professional 
      vessels or at landing. For each record, the type of fishing gear, the 
      conservation mode, as well as the fishing date and catch location are provided. 
      Individuals were sampled to span a wide range of body sizes: 565 ALB with fork 
      length from 58 to 118 cm, 155 BET from 29.5 to 173 cm, 304 SKJ from 30 to 74 cm, 
      and 340 YFT from 29 to 171.5 cm. The IndianEcoTuna dataset combines: (1) 9,512 
      records of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (percent element weights, δ(13) C 
      and δ(15) N values) in 1,185 fish, (2) 887 concentrations of total proteins in 
      242 fish, (3) 8,356 concentrations of total lipids and three lipid classes 
      (triacylglycerols TAG; phospholipids PL; sterols ST) in 695 fish, and (4) 1,150 
      and 1,033 profiles of neutral and polar fatty acids in 397 and 342 fish, 
      respectively. Information on sex and weights of the whole fish, gonads, liver and 
      stomach is provided. Because of the essential trophic role and wide-ranging of 
      tuna in marine systems, and the large panel of tropho-energetic tracers and 
      derived-key quantitative parameters provided (e.g., niche width, trophic 
      position, condition indices), the IndianEcoTuna dataset should be of high 
      interest for global and regional research on marine trophic ecology and food web 
      analysis, as well as on the impacts of anthropogenic changes on Indian Ocean 
      marine ecosystems. There are no copyright restrictions for research and/or 
      teaching purposes. Usage of the dataset must include citation of this Data Paper.

TI  - Elevated CO2 increases plant uptake of organic and inorganic N in the desert 
      shrub Larrea tridentata.
PG  - 257-66

AB  - Resource limitations, such as the availability of soil nitrogen (N), are expected 
      to constrain continued increases in plant productivity under elevated atmospheric 
      carbon dioxide (CO(2)). One potential but under-studied N source for supporting 
      increased plant growth under elevated CO(2) is soil organic N. In arid 
      ecosystems, there have been no studies examining plant organic N uptake to date. 
      To assess the potential effects of elevated atmospheric CO(2) on plant N uptake 
      dynamics, we quantified plant uptake of organic and inorganic N forms in the 
      dominant desert shrub Larrea tridentata under controlled environmental 
      conditions. Seedlings of L. tridentata were grown in the Mojave Desert (NV, USA) 
      soils that had been continuously exposed to ambient or elevated atmospheric CO(2) 
      for 8 years at the Nevada Desert FACE Facility. After 6 months of growth in 
      environmentally controlled chambers under ambient (380 micromol mol(-1)) or 
      elevated (600 micromol mol(-1)) CO(2), pots were injected with stable 
      isotopically labeled sole-N sources ((13)C-[2]-(15)N glycine, (15)NH(4) (+), or 
      (15)NO(3) (-)) and moved back to their respective chambers for the remainder of 
      the study. Plants were destructively harvested at 0, 2, 10, 24, and 49 days. 
      Plant uptake of soil N derived from glycine, NH(4) (+), and NO(3) (-) increased 
      under elevated CO(2) at days 2 and 10. Further, root uptake of organic N as 
      glycine occurred as intact amino acid within the first hour after N treatment, 
      indicated by approximately 1:1 M enrichment ratios of (13)C:(15)N. Plant N uptake 
      responses to elevated CO(2) are often species-specific and could potentially 
      shift competitive interactions between co-occurring species. Thus, physiological 
      changes in root N uptake dynamics coupled with previously observed changes in the 
      availability of soil N resources could impact plant community structure as well 
      as ecosystem nutrient cycling under increasing atmospheric CO(2) levels in the 
      Mojave Desert.

TI  - Water-Level Fluctuation Control of the Trophic Structure of a Yangtze River 
      Oxbow.
LID - 10.3390/biology12101359 [doi]
LID - 1359
AB  - Seasonal water-level fluctuations can profoundly impact nutrient dynamics in 
      aquatic ecosystems, influencing trophic structures and overall ecosystem 
      functions. The Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow of the Yangtze River is China's first ex situ 
      reserve and the world's first successful case of ex situ conservation for 
      cetaceans. In order to better protect the Yangtze finless porpoise, the effects 
      of water-level fluctuations on the trophic structure in this oxbow cannot be 
      ignored. Therefore, we employed stable isotope analysis to investigate the 
      changes in the trophic position, trophic niche, and contribution of basal food 
      sources to fish during the wet and dry seasons of 2021-2022. The research results 
      indicate that based on stable isotope analysis of the trophic levels of different 
      dietary fish species, fish trophic levels during the wet season were generally 
      higher than those during the dry season, but the difference was not significant 
      (p > 0.05). Fish communities in the Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow exhibited broader trophic 
      niche space and lower trophic redundancy during the wet season (p < 0.05), 
      indicating a more complex and stable food web structure. In both the wet and dry 
      seasons, fish in the oxbow primarily relied on endogenous carbon sources, but 
      there were significant differences in the way they were utilized between the two 
      seasons (p < 0.05). In light of the changes in the trophic structure of the fish 
      during the wet and dry seasons, and to ensure the stable development of the 
      Yangtze finless porpoise population, we recommend strengthening the connectivity 
      between the Tian-e-Zhou Oxbow and the Yangtze River.

AB  - Heat waves (HWs) are a type of extreme weather event that is of growing concern 
      in the scientific community. Yet field data based on sound experiment on the 
      variation of ecosystem CO(2) levels under HWs remain rare. Additionally, 
      ecosystems react to HWs and the coupled human activities (such as grazing in 
      grasslands) are unknown. Thus, a 3-year field experiment was conducted to 
      simulate HWs in conjunction with different mowing intensities that mimicking 
      grazing in a Stipa krylovii steppe on the Mongolian Plateau. HWs significantly 
      decreased ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO(2), ecosystem respiration (Re) and gross 
      ecosystem productivity (GEP) by 31%, 5% and 16%, respectively, over the three 
      years. Continuous HWs over multiple years produced cumulative effects by reducing 
      NEE at 20%, 34% and 40% in the first, second and third HW years, respectively. 
      During three pre-defined three periods of HWs (during HW period, after HW period 
      in the same year, and after HW period in the next year), variations in water use 
      efficiency indicated that the grassland ecosystem exhibited a strategy for 
      adapting to the continuous HWs to a certain extent, by adjusting community 
      structure or increasing litter biomass. Finally, mowing increased the effects of 
      HWs by extending the legacy effect, such that restoration of the grassland 
      required a greater amount of time under the combination of HWs and mowing.

AB  - Analysis of individual animal bodies can provide numerous useful insights in 
      archeology, including how humans provisioned such animals, which in turn informs 
      on a variety of other past behaviors such as human dietary patterns. In this 
      study, we conducted stable carbon (δ (13)C) and nitrogen (δ (15)N) isotope 
      analysis of collagen and keratin from four types of tissues from a dog burial at 
      the Ust'-Polui site in the Iamal region of Arctic Russia. Ust'-Polui is an Iron 
      Age site located on the Lower Ob River, a major northern fishery characterized by 
      extreme seasonal shifts in fish presence. During a 6-month period stretching over 
      the coldest months of the year, fish are nearly entirely absent in the Lower Ob 
      River. Despite this, the stable isotope compositions of the dog's bone and 
      dentine collagen and hair and nail keratin all indicate a monotonous diet 
      focusing on local fish. This pattern indicates the dog was provisioned year-round 
      with fish. This was likely accomplished by mass harvesting of fish using nets or 
      traps. Such fish were then processed and frozen for consumption during the 
      non-fishing season. These findings suggest that people in the Ust'-Polui region 
      also relied to some extent on fish throughout the year. Stored fish likely 
      provided a dietary buffer for uneven returns from reindeer and bird hunting, both 
      of which also are well-evidenced at the site.

      ratios: field and laboratory evidence.
PG  - 108-113
LID - 10.1007/s004420050064 [doi]
AB  -  Quantifying pathways of energy transfer between plants, pests, and beneficial 
      insects is a necessary step toward maintaining pest stable agroecosystems in the 
      absence of chemical subsidies. A diet switching experiment utilizing a predatory 
      ladybird beetle, Hippodamia variegata (Goeze), evaluated the use of naturally 
      occurring stable C and N isotopes as an economically feasible and safe method for 
      quantifying pathways of energy flow within agroecosystems. Stable isotope values 
      of the ladybird beetle Coleomegilla maculata lengi (Timberlake) collected from an 
      agroecosystem were used to estimate the relative amount of C and N derived from 
      agricultural plants and incorporated by ladybird beetles based on mass balance 
      equations. At the beginning of the diet-switching experiment δ(13)C and δ(15)N 
      values of H. variegata (-12.0‰ and 6.3‰, respectively) differed by -0.2‰ and 2.9‰ 
      from the aphids that were provided exclusively as their diet. These data are 
      consistent with previous estimates of trophic level isotope effects. After 
      switching the diet of H. variegata to an alternative food, isotope values of H. 
      variegata gradually shifted toward expected values for individuals fed this diet 
      (-22.9‰ and 8.8‰ for δ(13)C and δ(15)N values, respectively). Isotope values of 
      another ladybird beetle, C. maculata, collected from the field indicated that in 
      May, alfalfa and maize (pollen) obtained in the previous year contributed 32% and 
      68% of the C or N to the diets of these individuals and in August, 52%, 6%, and 
      42% of the C or N assimilated by these insects was derived from alfalfa, wheat, 
      and maize, respectively. These data are consistent with expectations based on the 
      relative abundance of C. maculata in various crops during the season. The field 
      and laboratory data are a clear indication that isotope values are sensitive to 
      dietary changes on a relatively short time scale (days) and provide a strong 
      basis for the use stable C and N isotope to trace energy flow patterns of these 
      beneficial organisms within agroecosystems.

AB  - Carbon isotopic fractionations in the processes of CH4 emission from paddy field 
      remain poorly understood. The δ(13)C-values of CH4 in association with 
      production, oxidation and transport of CH4 in different pools of a paddy field 
      were determined, and the stable carbon isotope fractionations were calibrated to 
      assess relative contribution of acetate to CH4 production (fac) and fraction of 
      CH4 oxidized (fox) by different pathways. The apparent isotope fractionation for 
      CO2 conversion to CH4 (αapp) was 1.041-1.056 in the soil and 1.046-1.080 on the 
      roots, indicating that fac was 10-60% and 0-50%, respectively. Isotope 
      fractionation associated with CH4 oxidation (αox) was 1.021 ± 0.007 in the soil 
      and 1.013 ± 0.005 on the roots, and the transport fractionation (εtransport) by 
      rice plants was estimated to be -16.7‰ ~ -11.1‰. Rhizospheric fox was about 
      30-100%, and it was more important at the beginning but decreased fast towards 
      the end of season. Large value of fox was also observed at the soil-water 
      interface and soil and roots surfaces, respectively. The results demonstrate that 
      carbon isotopic fractionations which might be different in different conditions 
      were sensitive to the estimations of fac and fox in paddy field.

TI  - Attack on all fronts: functional relationships between aerial and root parasitic 
      plants and their woody hosts and consequences for ecosystems.

AB  - This review discusses how understanding of functional relationships between 
      parasitic plants and their woody hosts have benefited from a range of approaches 
      to their study. Gross comparisons of nutrient content between infected and 
      uninfected hosts, or parts of hosts, have been widely used to infer basic 
      differences or similarities between hosts and parasites. Coupling of nutrient 
      information with additional evidence of key processes such as transpiration, 
      respiration and photosynthesis has helped elucidate host-parasite relationships 
      and, in some cases, the anatomical nature of their connection and even the 
      physiology of plants in general. For example, detailed analysis of xylem sap from 
      hosts and parasites has increased our understanding of the spatial and temporal 
      movement of solutes within plants. Tracer experiments using natural abundance or 
      enriched application of stable isotopes ((15)N, (13)C, (18)O) have helped us to 
      understand the extent and form of heterotrophy, including the effect of the 
      parasite on growth and functioning of the host (and its converse) as well as 
      environmental effects on the parasite. Nutritional studies of woody hosts and 
      parasites have provided clues to the distribution of parasitic plants and their 
      roles in ecosystems. This review also provides assessment of several corollaries 
      to the host-parasite association.

TI  - Dietary glutamine, glutamic acid and nucleotide supplementation accelerate carbon 
      turnover (δ(13)C) on stomach of weaned piglets.
PG  - 225-231
LID - 10.1016/j.aninu.2017.04.006 [doi]
AB  - The use of stable isotope analysis as a tool for characterization of carbon 
      turnover (δ(13)C) in piglet's tissues by tracing its feeding system has drawn 
      attention. Thus, this study aimed at evaluating the influence of dietary 
      glutamine, glutamic acid and nucleotides supplementation on carbon turnover in 
      fundic-stomach region of weaned piglets at an average age of 21 days. The diets 
      consisted of additive-free diet - control (C); 1% glutamine (G); 1% glutamic acid 
      (GA) and 1% nucleotides (Nu). At weaning day (day 0: baseline), 3 piglets were 
      slaughtered to quantify the δ(13)C of stomach. The remaining 120 piglets were 
      blocked by weight and sex, randomly assigned to pens with 3 piglets slaughtered 
      per treatment at days 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 13, 20, 27 and 49 after weaning in order 
      to verify the fundic-stomach isotopic composition by treatments. Samples were 
      analyzed in terms of (13)C/(1)(2)C ratio by mass spectrometry and converted to 
      relative isotopic enrichment values (δ(13)C ‰) used to plot the first order 
      exponential curves over time using OriginPro 8.0 software. The inclusion of 
      glutamine, glutamate and nucleotides in piglet's diets has accelerated the carbon 
      turnover in stomach during the post-weaning period, demonstrating also that 
      glutamate has guaranteed fastest (13)C incorporation rate on fundic-stomach 
      region and pH-lowering. Besides that, stable isotopes technique (δ(13)C) has 
      proved to be an important methodology to determine the time-scales at which 
      piglets shift among diets with different isotopic values, characterizing the 
      trophic effects of additives and the phenotypic flexibility of stomach.

AB  - We used stable isotope analyses to characterise the feeding dynamics of a 
      population of red swamp crayfish in Lake Naivasha, Kenya, after the crash of 
      submerged macrophytes and associated macroinvertebrates, and during a natural 
      draw-down of the lake water level. We expected a heavy reliance upon a diet of 
      detrital matter to sustain the population as a consequence, and indeed, for the 
      majority of the crayfish population caught from the lake, we saw a concomitant 
      shift in isotopic values reflecting a dietary change. However, we also caught 
      individual crayfish that had occupied the footprints of hippopotamus and 
      effectively extended their range beyond the lake up to 40 m into the riparian 
      zone. Isotopic analysis confirmed limited nocturnal observations that these 
      individuals were consuming living terrestrial plants in the vicinity of the 
      footprints. These are the first empirical data to demonstrate direct use of 
      terrestrial resources by an aquatic crayfish species and further highlight the 
      traits that make red swamp crayfish such opportunistic and successful invaders.

AB  - The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) mediated by microorganisms is a key 
      process in the reduction of methane emissions, and AOM-coupled electron acceptors 
      have been shown to regulate methane emissions into the atmosphere in marine 
      systems. Paddy fields are a significant source of methane and account for 20% of 
      global methane emissions, but the effect of electron acceptors on the methane 
      emission process in flooded paddy fields has been poorly characterized. This 
      study aimed to determine whether the electron acceptors ferric iron and nitrate, 
      and biochar, acting as an electron shuttle, can regulate the AOM process in paddy 
      soil, with or without interaction between biochar and these two electron 
      acceptors. We also aimed to characterize which microorganisms are actively 
      involved. Here, we added (13)C-labeled CH(4) ((13)CH(4)) into anaerobic 
      microcosms to evaluate the role of electron acceptors by measuring the methane 
      oxidation rate and the enrichment of (13)C-labeled CO(2) ((13)CO(2)). We then 
      combined DNA-stable isotope probing with amplicon sequencing to study the active 
      microorganisms. We found for the first time that, in addition to nitrate, ferric 
      iron can also effectively promote AOM in paddy soil. However, there was no 
      significant effect of biochar. Ferric iron-dependent AOM was mainly carried out 
      by iron-reducing bacteria (Geobacter, Ammoniphilus and Clostridium), and 
      nitrate-dependent AOM was mainly by nitrate-reducing bacteria (Rhodanobacter, 
      Paenibacillus and Planococcus). Our results demonstrate that the AOM process, 
      regulated by the electron acceptors ferric iron and nitrate, can alleviate 
      methane emission from paddy soil. The potentially active microorganisms related 
      to electron acceptor reduction may be crucial for this methane sink and deserve 
      further research.

AB  - Energy flows from land to sea and between pelagic and benthic environments have 
      the potential to increase the connectivity between estuaries and adjacent 
      ecosystems as well as among estuarine habitats. To identify such energy flows and 
      the main trophic pathways of energy transfer in the Minho River estuary, we 
      investigated the spatial and temporal fluctuations of carbon and nitrogen stable 
      isotope ratios in benthic (and their potential food sources) and epibenthic 
      consumers. Sampling was conducted along the estuarine salinity gradient from 
      winter to summer of 2011. We found that the carbon (δ(13)C = (13)C/(12)C) and 
      nitrogen (δ(15)N = (15)N/(14)N) stable isotope ratios of the most abundant 
      benthic and epibenthic consumers varied along the salinity gradient. The δ(13)C 
      values increased seaward, whereas the opposite pattern was found for the δ(15)N, 
      especially during the summer. The stable isotope ratios revealed two trophic 
      pathways in the Minho estuary food web. The first pathway is supported by 
      phytoplankton and represented by filter feeders such as zooplankton and some 
      deposit feeders, particularly amphipods and polychaetes. The second pathway is 
      supported by detritus and composed essentially of deposit feeders, which by being 
      consumed, allow detritus to be incorporated into higher trophic levels. Spatial 
      and temporal feeding variations in the estuarine benthic food web are driven by 
      hydrology and proximity to adjacent ecosystems (terrestrial, marine). During high 
      river discharge periods, the δ(13)C(POC) (ca. -28‰) and C: N(POM) (>10) values 
      suggested an increase of terrestrial-derived OM to the particulate OM pool, which 
      was then used by suspension feeders. During low river discharge periods, marine 
      intrusion increased upriver, which was reflected in benthic consumers' 
      (13)C-enriched stable isotope values. No relationship was found between food 
      quality (phytoplankton vs. detritus) and food chain length because the lowest and 
      highest values were associated with freshwater and saltmarsh areas, respectively, 
      both dominated by the detrital pathway. This study demonstrates that benthic 
      consumers enhance the connectivity between estuaries and its adjacent ecosystems 
      by utilizing subsidies of terrestrial and marine origin and that benthic-pelagic 
      coupling is an important energy transfer mechanism to the benthic food web.

AB  - In marine and freshwater oxygen-deficient zones, the remineralization of sinking 
      organic matter from the photic zone is central to driving nitrogen loss. Deep 
      blooms of photosynthetic bacteria, which form the suboxic/anoxic chlorophyll 
      maximum (ACM), widespread in aquatic ecosystems, may also contribute to the local 
      input of organic matter. Yet, the influence of the ACM on nitrogen and carbon 
      cycling remains poorly understood. Using a suite of stable isotope tracer 
      experiments, we examined the transformation of nitrogen and carbon under an ACM 
      (comprising of Chlorobiaceae and Synechococcales) and a non-ACM scenario in the 
      anoxic zone of Lake Tanganyika. We find that the ACM hosts a tight coupling of 
      photo/litho-autotrophic and heterotrophic processes. In particular, the ACM was a 
      hotspot of organic matter remineralization that controlled an important supply of 
      ammonium driving a nitrification-anammox coupling, and thereby played a key role 
      in regulating nitrogen loss in the oxygen-deficient zone.

TI  - Reconstructing the life of an unknown (ca. 500 years-old South American Inca) 
      mummy--multidisciplinary study of a Peruvian Inca mummy suggests severe Chagas 
      disease and ritual homicide.
PG  - e89528

AB  - The paleopathological, paleoradiological, histological, molecular and forensic 
      investigation of a female mummy (radiocarbon dated 1451-1642 AD) provides 
      circumstantial evidence for massive skull trauma affecting a young adult female 
      individual shortly before death along with chronic infection by Trypanosoma cruzi 
      (Chagas disease). The mummy (initially assumed to be a German bog body) was 
      localized by stable isotope analysis to South America at/near the 
      Peruvian/Northern Chilean coast line. This is further supported by New World 
      camelid fibers attached to her plaits, typical Inca-type skull deformation and 
      the type of Wormian bone at her occiput. Despite an only small transverse wound 
      of the supraorbital region computed tomography scans show an almost complete 
      destruction of face and frontal skull bones with terrace-like margins, but 
      without evidence for tissue reaction. The type of destruction indicates massive 
      blunt force applied to the center of the face. Stable isotope analysis indicates 
      South American origin: Nitrogen and hydrogen isotope patterns indicate an 
      extraordinarily high marine diet along with C4-plant alimentation which fits best 
      to the coastal area of Pacific South America. A hair strand over the last ten 
      months of her life indicates a shift to a more "terrestric" nutrition pattern 
      suggesting either a move from the coast or a change in her nutrition. 
      Paleoradiology further shows extensive hypertrophy of the heart muscle and a 
      distended large bowel/rectum. Histologically, in the rectum wall massive fibrosis 
      alternates with residual smooth muscle. The latter contains multiple inclusions 
      of small intracellular parasites as confirmed by immunohistochemical and 
      molecular ancient DNA analysis to represent a chronic Trypanosoma cruzi 
      infection. This case shows a unique paleopathological setting with massive blunt 
      force trauma to the skull nurturing the hypothesis of a ritual homicide as 
      previously described in South American mummies in an individual that suffered 
      from severe chronic Chagas disease.

LID - 181869
AB  - Soil detritivores such as Collembola impact plant growth, tissue nutrient 
      concentration and gene expression. Using a model system with pedunculate oak 
      (Quercus robur) microcuttings that display a typical endogenous rhythmic growth 
      with alternating shoot (SF) and root flushes (RF), we investigated the 
      transcriptomic response of oak with and without mycorrhiza (Piloderma croceum) to 
      the presence of Collembola (Protaphorura armata), and linked it to changes in 
      resource allocation by pulse labelling the plants with (13)C and (15)N. 
      Collembola impacted Gene Ontology (GO) terms as well as plant morphology and 
      elemental ratios with the effects varying markedly with developmental phases. 
      During SF Collembola increased GO terms related to primary growth and this was 
      mirrored in increased (13)C and (15)N excess in aboveground plant compartments. 
      During RF, Collembola increased GO terms related to plant secondary metabolism 
      and physical fortification. Further, Collembola presence resulted in an increase 
      in plant defence-related GO terms suggesting that Collembola in the rhizosphere 
      prime oak shoots against the attack by fungi or herbivores. Notably, the impact 
      of Collembola on growth, resource allocation and oak gene expression was modified 
      by presence of P. croceum. The results indicate that oaks clearly react to the 
      presence of Collembola in the rhizosphere and respond in a complex way by 
      changing the expression of genes of both primary and secondary metabolism, and 
      this resulted in concomitant changes in plant morphology and physiology.

TI  - We are what we eat, plus some per mill: Using stable isotopes to estimate diet 
      composition in Gyps vultures over space and time.
PG  - e8726
LID - 10.1002/ece3.8726 [doi]
LID - e8726
AB  - Dietary studies in birds of prey involve direct observation and examination of 
      food remains at resting and nesting sites. Although these methods accurately 
      identify diet in raptors, they are time-consuming, resource-intensive, and 
      associated with biases from the feeding ecology of raptors like Gyps vultures. 
      Our study set out to estimate diet composition in Gyps vultures informed by 
      stable isotopes that provide a good representation of assimilated diet from local 
      systems.We hypothesized that differences in Gyps vulture diet composition is a 
      function of sampling location and that these vultures move between Serengeti 
      National Park and Selous Game Reserve to forage. We also theorized that grazing 
      ungulates are the principal items in Gyps vulture diet.Through combined linear 
      and Bayesian modeling, diet derived from δ(13)C in Gyps vultures consisted of 
      grazing herbivores across sites, with those in Serengeti National Park consuming 
      higher proportions of grazing herbivores (>87%). δ(13)C differences in vulture 
      feather subsets did not indicate shifts in vulture diet and combined with blood 
      δ(13)C, vultures fed largely on grazers for ~159 days before they were sampled. 
      Similarly, δ(15)N values indicated Gyps vultures fed largely on herbivores. 
      δ(34)S ratios separated where vultures fed when the two sites were compared. 
      δ(34)S variation in vultures across sites resulted from baseline differences in 
      plant δ(34)S values, though it is not possible to match δ(34)S to specific 
      locations.Our findings highlight the relevance of repeated sampling that 
      considers tissues with varying isotopic turnover and emerging Bayesian techniques 
      for dietary studies using stable isotopes. Findings also suggested limited 
      vulture movement between the two local systems. However, more sampling coupled 
      with environmental data is required to fully comprehend this observation and its 
      implications to Gyps vulture ecology and conservation.

      Calamagrostis canadensis. The very low δ(15)N values (-7.7 ‰) suggest that (1) 
      Picea mainly uses inorganic nitrogen (probably mainly ammonium) or organic N in 
      fresh litter, (2) Vaccinium (-4.3 ‰) with its ericoid mycorrhizae uses more 
      stable organic matter, and (3) Calamagrostis (+0.9 ‰) exploits deeper soil 
      horizons with higher δ(15)N values of soil N. We conclude that species limited by 
      the same nutrient may coexist by drawing on different pools of soil N in a 
      nutrient-deficient environment. The differences among life-forms decrease with 
      increasing N availability. The different levels of δ(15)N are associated with 
      different nitrogen concentrations in leaves, Picea having a lower N concentration 
      (0.62 mmol g(-1)) than Vaccinium (0.98 mmol g(-1)) or Calamagrostis (1.33 mmol 
      g(-1)). An extended vector analysis by Timmer and Armstrong (1987) suggests that 
      N is the most limiting element for Picea in this habitat, causing needle 
      yellowing at N concentrations below 0.5 mmol g(-1) or N contents below 2 mmol 
      needle(-1). Increasing N supply had an exponential effect on twig and needle 
      growth. Phosphorus, potassium and magnesium are at marginal supply, but no 
      interaction between ammonium supply and needle Mg concentration could be 
      detected. Calcium is in adequate supply on both calcareous and acidic soils. The 
      results are compared with European conditions of excessive N supply from 
      anthropogenic N depositions.

AB  - Wildlife inhabiting environments contaminated by radionuclides face putative 
      detrimental effects of exposure to ionizing radiation, with biomarkers such as an 
      increase in DNA damage and/or oxidative stress commonly associated with radiation 
      exposure. To examine the effects of exposure to radiation on gene expression in 
      wildlife, we conducted a de novo RNA sequencing study of liver and spleen tissues 
      from a rodent, the bank vole Myodes glareolus. Bank voles were collected from the 
      Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (CEZ), where animals were exposed to elevated levels of 
      radionuclides, and from uncontaminated areas near Kyiv, Ukraine. Counter to 
      expectations, we did not observe a strong DNA damage response in animals exposed 
      to radionuclides, although some signs of oxidative stress were identified. 
      Rather, exposure to environmental radionuclides was associated with upregulation 
      of genes involved in lipid metabolism and fatty acid oxidation in the livers - an 
      apparent shift in energy metabolism. Moreover, using stable isotope analysis, we 
      identified that fur from bank voles inhabiting the CEZ had enriched isotope 
      values of nitrogen: such an increase is consistent with increased fatty acid 
      metabolism, but also could arise from a difference in diet or habitat between the 
      CEZ and elsewhere. In livers and spleens, voles inhabiting the CEZ were 
      characterized by immunosuppression, such as impaired antigen processing, and 
      activation of leucocytes involved in inflammatory responses. In conclusion, 
      exposure to low dose environmental radiation impacts pathways associated with 
      immunity and lipid metabolism, potentially as a stress-induced coping mechanism.

TI  - Invasive crayfish impacts on native fish diet and growth vary with fish life 
      stage.
PG  - 113-125
LID - 10.1007/s00027-016-0483-2 [doi]
AB  - Assessing the impacts of invasive organisms is a major challenge in ecology. Some 
      widespread invasive species such as crayfish are potential competitors and 
      reciprocal predators of ecologically and recreationally important native fish 
      species. Here, we examine the effects of signal crayfish (Pacifastacus 
      leniusculus) on the growth, diet, and trophic position of the chub (Squalius 
      cephalus) in four rivers in Britain. Growth rates of 0+ chub were typically lower 
      in sympatric populations with signal crayfish compared with allopatric 
      populations, and this effect could be traced through to 2+ chub in one river. 
      However, growth rates of older chub (5+ to 6+) were typically higher in the 
      presence of crayfish. Sympatry with crayfish resulted in lower chub length-at-age 
      and mass-at-age in half of the rivers sampled, with no change detected in the 
      other rivers. Stable isotope analyses (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) revealed that both chub 
      and crayfish were omnivorous, feeding at multiple trophic levels and occupying 
      similar trophic positions. We found some evidence that chub trophic position was 
      greater at invaded sites on one river, with no difference detected on a second 
      river. Mixing models suggested crayfish were important food items for both small 
      and large chub at invaded sites. This study provides evidence that invasive 
      species can have both positive and negative effects on different life stages of a 
      native species, with the net impact likely to depend on responses at the 
      population level.

AB  - •  Translocation is shown of phosphorus, nitrogen, potassium and magnesium to a 
      P-deficient host from ectomycorrhizal fungal hyphae. •  Mycorrhizal (with 
      Paxillus involutus) and nonmycorrhizal P-deficient spruce (P. abies) seedlings 
      were grown in a two-compartment sand-culture system. Hyphal translocation of 
      nutrients from the inner compartment (penetrated only by hyphae) to the host was 
      measured using mass balance (for N, P and K) or stable isotope ((15) N and (25) 
      Mg) methods. •  Addition of P to the hyphal compartment strongly stimulated 
      hyphal growth, and this also increased both seedling P status and growth. Hyphae 
      translocated nonlimiting elements in addition to P, contributing 52, 17, 5 and 
      3-4%, respectively, to total P, N, K or Mg plant uptake. The potential role of 
      the ectomycorrhizal mycelium in K acquisition was demonstrated. Translocation to 
      mycorrhizal seedings of N, K and Mg was strongly reduced when hyphal P-fluxes 
      ceased; this translocation of nonlimiting nutrients depended on simultaneous 
      translocation of P. •  The ectomycorrhizal mycelium has an active role in P 
      acquisition from sources not available to roots. Nutrient fluxes within fungal 
      hyphae are interdependent and strong coupling of N, K and Mg fluxes with 
      long-distance P translocation in the mycorrhizal mycelium occurs.

TI  - Different Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi Cocolonizing on a Single Plant Root System 
      Recruit Distinct Microbiomes.
LID - 10.1128/mSystems.00929-20 [doi]
LID - e00929-20
AB  - Plant roots are usually colonized by various arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal 
      species, which vary in morphological, physiological, and genetic traits. This 
      colonization constitutes the mycorrhizal nutrient uptake pathway (MP) and 
      supplements the pathway through roots. Simultaneously, the extraradical hyphae of 
      each AM fungus is associated with a community of bacteria. However, whether the 
      community structure and function of the microbiome on the extraradical hyphae 
      differ between AM fungal species remains unknown. In order to understand the 
      community structure and the predicted functions of the microbiome associated with 
      different AM fungal species, a split-root compartmented rhizobox cultivation 
      system, which allowed us to inoculate two AM fungal species separately in two 
      root compartments, was used. We inoculated two separate AM fungal species 
      combinations, (i) Funneliformis mosseae and Gigaspora margarita and (ii) 
      Rhizophagus intraradices and G. margarita, on a single root system of cotton. The 
      hyphal exudate-fed, active microbiome was measured by combining (13)C-DNA stable 
      isotope probing with MiSeq sequencing. We found that different AM fungal species, 
      which were simultaneously colonizing a single root system, hosted active 
      microbiomes that were distinct from one another. Moreover, the predicted 
      potential functions of the different microbiomes were distinct. We conclude that 
      the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal component of the system is responsible for the 
      recruitment of distinct microbiomes in the hyphosphere. The potential 
      significance of the predicted functions of the microbial ecosystem services is 
      discussed.IMPORTANCE Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form tight symbiotic 
      relationships with the majority of terrestrial plants and play critical roles in 
      plant P acquisition, adding a further dimension of complexity. The plant-AM 
      fungus-bacterium system is considered a continuum, with the bacteria colonizing 
      not only the plant roots, but also the associated mycorrhizal hyphal network, 
      known as the hyphosphere microbiome. Plant roots are usually colonized by 
      different AM fungal species which form an independent phosphorus uptake pathway 
      from the root pathway, i.e., the mycorrhizal pathway. The community structure and 
      function of the hyphosphere microbiome of different AM species are completely 
      unknown. In this novel study, we found that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 
      cocolonizing on single plant roots recruit their own specific microbiomes, which 
      should be considered in evaluating plant microbiome form and function. Our 
      findings demonstrate the importance of understanding trophic interactions in 
      order to gain insight into the plant-AM fungus-bacterium symbiosis.

AB  - The first step of nitrification, the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite, is 
      important for reducing eutrophication in freshwater environments when coupled 
      with anammox (anaerobic ammonium oxidation) or denitrification. We analyzed 
      active formerly biofilm-associated aerobic ammonia-oxidizing communities 
      originating from Ammerbach (AS) and Leutra South (LS) stream water (683 ± 550 
      [mean ± standard deviation] and 16 ± 7 μM NH(4)(+), respectively) that were 
      developed in a flow-channel experiment and incubated under three temperature 
      regimens. By stable-isotope probing using (13)CO(2), we found that members of the 
      Bacteria and not Archaea were the functionally dominant autotrophic ammonia 
      oxidizers at all temperatures under relatively high ammonium loads. The copy 
      numbers of bacterial amoA genes in (13)C-labeled DNA were lower at 30°C than at 
      13°C in both stream enrichment cultures. However, the community composition of 
      the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in the (13)C-labeled DNA responded 
      differently to temperature manipulation at two ammonium concentrations. In LS 
      enrichments incubated at the in situ temperature (13°C), Nitrosomonas 
      oligotropha-like sequences were retrieved with sequences from Nitrosospira AmoA 
      cluster 4, while the proportion of Nitrosospira sequences increased at higher 
      temperatures. In AS enrichments incubated at 13°C and 20°C, AmoA cluster 4 
      sequences were dominant; Nitrosomonas nitrosa-like sequences dominated at 30°C. 
      Biofilm-associated AOB communities were affected differentially by temperature at 
      two relatively high ammonium concentrations, implicating them in a potential role 
      in governing contaminated freshwater AOB distributions.

AB  - The success of many sessile invertebrates in marine benthic communities is linked 
      to their ability to efficiently remove suspended organic matter from the 
      surrounding water column. To investigate the diet of the barnacle Amphibalanus 
      eburneus, a dominant suspension feeder within the Indian River Lagoon (IRL) of 
      central Florida, we compared the stable isotopes ratios (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) of 
      barnacle tissue to those of particulate organic matter (POM). Collections were 
      carried out quarterly for a year from 29 permanent sites and at sites impacted by 
      an Aureoumbra lagunensis bloom. δ(13)C and δ(15)N values of Amphibalanus eburneus 
      varied across sites, but δ(15)N was more stable over time. There was a range of 
      δ(15)N values of Amphibalanus eburneus tissue from 6.0‰ to 10.5‰ across sites. 
      Because land-based sources such as sewage are generally enriched in (15)N, this 
      suggests a continuum of anthropogenic influence across sites in the IRL. Over 70% 
      of the variation in δ(15)N values of Amphibalanus eburneus across sites was 
      driven by the δ(15)N values of POM, supporting a generalist feeding strategy on 
      available sources of suspended organic matter. The dominance of this generalist 
      consumer in the IRL may be linked to its ability to consume spatially and 
      temporally variable food resources derived from natural and anthropogenic 
      sources, as well as Aureoumbra lagunensis cells. Generalist consumers such as 
      Amphibalanus eburneus serve an important ecological role in this ecosystem and 
      act as a sentinel species and recorder of local, site-specific isotopic 
      baselines.

TI  - Coupled CH(4) production and oxidation support CO(2) supersaturation in a 
      tropical flood pulse lake (Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia).
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2107667119 [doi]

AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) supersaturation in lakes and rivers worldwide is commonly 
      attributed to terrestrial-aquatic transfers of organic and inorganic carbon (C) 
      and subsequent, in situ aerobic respiration. Methane (CH(4)) production and 
      oxidation also contribute CO(2) to freshwaters, yet this remains largely 
      unquantified. Flood pulse lakes and rivers in the tropics are hypothesized to 
      receive large inputs of dissolved CO(2) and CH(4) from floodplains characterized 
      by hypoxia and reducing conditions. We measured stable C isotopes of CO(2) and 
      CH(4), aerobic respiration, and CH(4) production and oxidation during two flood 
      stages in Tonle Sap Lake (Cambodia) to determine whether dissolved CO(2) in this 
      tropical flood pulse ecosystem has a methanogenic origin. Mean CO(2) 
      supersaturation of 11,000 ± 9,000 μatm could not be explained by aerobic 
      respiration alone. (13)C depletion of dissolved CO(2) relative to other sources 
      of organic and inorganic C, together with corresponding (13)C enrichment of 
      CH(4), suggested extensive CH(4) oxidation. A stable isotope-mixing model shows 
      that the oxidation of (13)C depleted CH(4) to CO(2) contributes between 47 and 
      67% of dissolved CO(2) in Tonle Sap Lake. (13)C depletion of dissolved CO(2) was 
      correlated to independently measured rates of CH(4) production and oxidation 
      within the water column and underlying lake sediments. However, mass balance 
      indicates that most of this CH(4) production and oxidation occurs elsewhere, 
      within inundated soils and other floodplain habitats. Seasonal inundation of 
      floodplains is a common feature of tropical freshwaters, where high reported 
      CO(2) supersaturation and atmospheric emissions may be explained in part by 
      coupled CH(4) production and oxidation.

AB  - Offshore wind farms (OWFs) and their associated cables, foundations and scour 
      protection are often constructed in soft-sediment environments. This introduction 
      of hard substrate has been shown to have similar effects as artificial reefs by 
      providing food resources and offering increased habitat complexity, thereby 
      aggregating fish around the turbines and foundations. However, as most studies 
      have focused their efforts on fish species that are typically associated with 
      reef structures, knowledge on how soft sediment species are affected by OWFs is 
      still largely lacking. In this study, we analysed the trophic ecology and 
      condition of plaice, a flatfish species of commercial interest, in relation to a 
      Belgian OWF. The combination of a stomach and intestine content analysis with the 
      use of biomarkers (i.e. fatty acids and stable isotopes) identified a clear shift 
      in diet with increased occurrences of typical hard-substrate prey species for 
      fish in the vicinity of the foundations and this both on the short and the long 
      term. Despite some condition indices suggesting that the hard substrate provides 
      increased food availability, no clear increases of overall plaice condition or 
      fecundity were found. Samples from within the wind farm, however, contained 
      larger fish and had a higher abundance of females compared to control areas, 
      potentially indicating a refuge effect caused by the cessation of fisheries 
      activities within the OWF. These results suggest that soft-sediment species can 
      potentially benefit from the presence of an OWF, which could lead to fish 
      production. However, more research is still needed to further elucidate the 
      behavioral ecology of plaice within OWFs to make inferences on how they can 
      impact fish populations on a larger spatial scale.

AB  - The operation of modern wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is driven by 
      activated sludge microbiota, a complex assemblage of trophically interacting 
      microorganisms. Microbial predation is crucial to fundamental understanding of 
      how biological interactions drive microbiome structuring and functioning of 
      WWTPs. However, predatory bacteria have received little attention regarding their 
      diversity, activity, and ecological function in activated sludge, limiting the 
      exploitation of food web interactions for wastewater microbiome engineering. 
      Here, by using rRNA-stable isotope probing of activated sludge microbiota with 
      (13)C-labeled prey bacteria, we uncovered diverse as-yet-uncultivated putative 
      predatory bacteria that actively incorporated (13)C-biomass. Myxobacteria, 
      especially Haliangium and the mle1-27 clade, were found as the dominant active 
      predators, refreshing conventional views based on a few predatory isolates of 
      Bdellovibrionota from WWTPs. The identified predatory bacteria showed more 
      selective predation on prey compared with the protists dominated by ciliates, 
      providing in situ evidence for inter-domain predation behavior divergence in 
      activated sludge. Putative predatory bacteria were tracked over a two-year 
      microbiome monitoring effort at a local WWTP, revealing the predominance of 
      Myxococcota (6.5 ± 1.3%) over Bdellovibrionota (1.0 ± 0.2%) lineages. 
      Phylogenetic analysis unveiled highly diverse myxobacteria inhabiting activated 
      sludge and suggested a habitat filtering effect in global WWTPs. Further mining 
      of a global activated sludge microbiome dataset revealed the prevalence of 
      Myxococcota (5.4 ± 0.1%) species and potential impacts of myxobacterial predation 
      on process performance. Collectively, our findings provided unique insights into 
      the predating activity, diversity, and prevalence of Myxococcota species in 
      activated sludge, highlighting their links with wastewater treatment processes 
      via trophic regulation of enteric and functional bacteria.

TI  - The influence of hydrogeological disturbance and mining on coal seam microbial 
      communities.
PG  - 163-75
LID - 10.1111/gbi.12166 [doi]
AB  - The microbial communities present in two underground coal mines in the Bowen 
      Basin, Queensland, Australia, were investigated to deduce the effect of pumping 
      and mining on subsurface methanogens and methanotrophs. The micro-organisms in 
      pumped water from the actively mined areas, as well as, pre- and post-mining 
      formation waters were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The 
      methane stable isotope composition of Bowen Basin coal seam indicates that 
      methanogenesis has occurred in the geological past. More recently at the mine 
      site, changing groundwater flow dynamics and the introduction of oxygen in the 
      subsurface has increased microbial biomass and diversity. Consistent with 
      microbial communities found in other coal seam environments, pumped coal mine 
      waters from the subsurface were dominated by bacteria belonging to the genera 
      Pseudomonas and the family Rhodocyclaceae. These environments and bacterial 
      communities supported a methanogen population, including Methanobacteriaceae, 
      Methanococcaceae and Methanosaeta. However, one of the most ubiquitous 
      micro-organisms in anoxic coal mine waters belonged to the family 'Candidatus 
      Methanoperedenaceae'. As the Archaeal family 'Candidatus Methanoperedenaceae' has 
      not been extensively defined, the one studied species in the family is capable of 
      anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to nitrate reduction. This introduces the 
      possibility that a methane cycle between archaeal methanogenesis and 
      methanotrophy may exist in the anoxic waters of the coal seam after 
      hydrogeological disturbance.

TI  - Exploring the partitioning of hydrophobic organic compounds between water, 
      suspended particulate matter and diverse fish species in a German river 
      ecosystem.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bioaccumulation of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) along 
      freshwater food chains is a major environmental concern as top predators in food 
      webs are relevant for human consumption. To characterize and manage the 
      associated risks, considerable numbers of organisms are sampled regularly for 
      monitoring purposes. However, ethical and financial issues call for an 
      alternative, more generic and more robust approach for assessing the internal 
      exposure of fish that circumvents large variability in biota sampling due to 
      interindividual differences. Passive sampling devices (PSDs) offer a 
      fugacity-based approach for pollutant enrichment from different abiotic 
      environmental compartments with a subsequent estimation of bioaccumulation in 
      fish which we explored and compared to HOC concentrations in fish as determined 
      using traditional approaches. RESULTS: In this study, concentrations in 
      silicone-based PSDs applied to the water phase and suspended particulate matter 
      (SPM) of a river polluted with HOCs were used to estimate the concentration in 
      model lipids at thermodynamic equilibrium with either environmental compartment. 
      For comparison, muscle tissue of seven fish species (trophic level 1.8 to 2.8) 
      was extracted using traditional exhaustive solvent extraction, and the 
      lipid-normalized concentrations of HOCs were determined. The PSD-based data from 
      SPM proved to be a more conservative estimator for HOCs accumulated in fish than 
      those from water. Body length of the fish was found to be more suitable to 
      describe increasing accumulation of HOCs than their trophic level as derived from 
      stable isotope analysis and might offer a suitable alternative for future 
      studies. CONCLUSIONS: By combining fugacity-based sampling in the abiotic 
      environment, translation into corresponding concentrations in model lipids and 
      body length as an indicator for increasing bioaccumulation in fish, we present a 
      suggestion for a robust approach that may be a meaningful addition to 
      conventional monitoring methods. This approach potentially increases the 
      efficiency of existing monitoring programs without the need to 
      regularly sacrifice vertebrate species. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online 
      version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12302-022-00644-w.

LID - 10.1007/s00572-022-01080-7 [doi]
AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi colonise plant roots, and by doing so forge the 
      'mycorrhizal uptake pathway(s)' (MUP) that provide passageways for the trade of 
      resources across a specialised membrane at the plant-fungus interface. The 
      transport of nutrients such as phosphorus (P), nitrogen and zinc from the fungus, 
      and carbon from the plant, via the MUP have mostly been quantified using stable 
      or radioactive isotope labelling of soil in a specialised hyphae-only 
      compartment. Recent advances in the study of AM fungi have used tracing studies 
      to better understand how the AM association will function in a changing climate, 
      the extent to which the MUP can contribute to P uptake by important crops, and 
      how AM fungi trade resources in interaction with plants, other AM fungi, and 
      friend and foe in the soil microbiome. The existing work together with 
      well-designed future experiments will provide a valuable assessment of the 
      potential for AM fungi to play a role in the sustainability of managed and 
      natural systems in a changing climate.

TI  - Disturbance-Induced Trophic Niche Shifts In Ground Beetles (Coleoptera: 
      Carabidae) In Restored Grasslands.

AB  - Ecosystem restoration is a critical component of land management, countering the 
      loss of native biodiversity. Restoration efforts are enhanced by reintroducing 
      naturally occurring ecosystem processes, including disturbances that may impact 
      species characteristics such as niche position or niche size. In grasslands, 
      grazing and fire affect plant diversity and habitat complexity, which potentially 
      influence insect dietary behaviors and thus their contributions to functions like 
      seed and arthropod predation. Using carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes, we 
      characterized variation in the dietary niche of six ground beetle species 
      (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in response to grazing by reintroduced bison and 
      prescribed fire disturbances in twenty tallgrass prairies. Management 
      disturbances did not affect activity density for most beetle species and mean 
      trophic position was mostly unaffected. However, five of six species exhibited 
      increased trophic niche area and breadth with disturbances, indicating a switch 
      to a more generalist diet that incorporated a wider range of food items. The 
      combination of bison and fire impacts may increase vegetation patchiness and 
      heterogeneity, driving these diet changes. Morphological traits and microhabitat 
      preferences might mediate response to disturbances and the resulting 
      heterogeneity. Combining prescribed fire and grazing, which increases plant 
      diversity and vegetation structural diversity, may help beetle communities 
      establish over time and support the ecological functions to which these insects 
      contribute.

TI  - Endogenous versus exogenous carbohydrate oxidation measured by stable isotopes in 
      pre-pubescent children plus (13)C abundances in foods consumed three days prior.

LID - 100041
AB  - PURPOSE: The purposes of the present study were to (a) examine resting 
      metabolism, substrate utilization, and endogenous versus exogenous carbohydrate 
      (CHO) oxidation before and after 30-g rapidly-digesting carbohydrate (RDC) 
      ingestion using indirect calorimetry and breath test analysis of stable isotope 
      concentrations in pre-pubescent children and (b) report the (13)C abundances in 
      foods consumed for three days prior. METHODS: Nineteen children (n = 10 boys, 
      n = 9 girls) at Tanner stage I or II participated (mean age ± 95% 
      CI = 9.84 ± 0.77 y) in this study. Food was administered to the children for 
      three days preceding their scheduled breath tests. Breath tests and indirect 
      calorimetry were performed after an 8-h fast before and 60 min following 
      consumption of a 30-g simple RDC drink consisting of maltodextrin and sucrose. 
      Open circuit spirometry and indirect calorimetry monitored resting metabolism and 
      CHO oxidation. Separate breath samples were taken every 15 min. Samples of all 
      foods and breath samples were analyzed for (13)C and (12)C abundances with a 
      stable-isotope mass spectrometer. RESULTS: (13)C in expired breath samples 
      were -23.81 ± 1.64‰ at baseline and increased every 15 min after consumption of 
      the CHO drink (p < 0.001-0.009). Cumulative total, endogenous, and exogenous CHO 
      utilization increased during the post-prandial period (p < 0.001). Endogenous CHO 
      oxidation was consistently greater than exogenous CHO oxidation 
      (p < 0.001-0.002).Blood glucose was elevated from baseline at 30- and 60-min 
      post-prandial (p < 0.001). Insulin did not change over time (p = 0.184). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The foods provided during the 3-day controlled diet effectively 
      minimized (13)C variation prior to metabolic testing. The (13)C abundances of 
      foods reported herein should serve as practical recommendations to reduce (13)C 
      intake before breath tests. While endogenous CHO oxidation remained greater in 
      proportion to exogenous CHO oxidation, these findings suggest that even a 
      relatively small amount of RDC can increase exogenous CHO oxidation and blood 
      glucose in normal-weight children. To further examine shifts in endogenous versus 
      exogenous CHO utilization, we recommend that future studies take steps to 
      minimize (13)C variation before breath tests and examine changes in substrate 
      metabolism at rest and during exercise in normal weight and overweight 
      pre-pubescent children. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03185884.

TI  - Resource partitioning is not coupled with assortative mating in sympatrically 
      divergent ricefish in a Wallacean ancient lake.
PG  - 1133-1143
LID - 10.1111/jeb.13874 [doi]
AB  - Sympatric speciation is considered to be difficult without the coupling between 
      ecological traits that allow resource partitioning and reproductive traits that 
      allow assortative mating. Such "magic traits" are known to be involved in most of 
      the compelling examples of sympatric speciation. In this study, we report a 
      possible case of sympatric speciation without magic traits. Three species of 
      ricefish (genus Oryzias) are suggested to have diverged sympatrically within Lake 
      Poso, an ancient lake in Sulawesi. An analysis of genome-wide single-nucleotide 
      polymorphisms showed that these three species are reproductively isolated from 
      each other throughout the lake. Stable isotope analyses revealed that the three 
      species use different food resources, which reflect differences in their feeding 
      morphologies (gill rakers and digestive tracts) and feeding sites. Field and 
      laboratory observations showed that O. nebulosus and O. orthognathus share a 
      mating habitat of cobbles, where they scatter fertilized eggs, whereas this site 
      is never used by O. nigrimas, indicating that assortative mating is partly 
      achieved by spatial isolation. The small, less-adhesive eggs of O. nebulosus and 
      O. orthognathus probably reflect their adaptation to spawning on cobble beaches. 
      Laboratory mating experiments showed strong prezygotic isolation between 
      O. nebulosus and O. orthognathus, which is achieved by strong species recognition 
      presumably by both sexes based on species-specific mating dances and nuptial 
      coloration. In summary, the assortative mating of O. nebulosus and 
      O. orthognathus is probably not coupled to resource partitioning. We discussed 
      how sympatric speciation among these species might have been achieved even 
      without magic traits.

TI  - Ecological divergence among colour morphs mediated by changes in spatial network 
      structure associated with disturbance.
PG  - 1490-500
LID - 10.1111/1365-2656.12252 [doi]
AB  - Differences in individual behaviour affect social interactions and contribute to 
      the spatial structuring of animal populations. However, disturbance should also 
      affect spatial networks by altering habitat heterogeneity and resource 
      availability. Variation in resource availability should perturb the frequency and 
      nature of social and ecological interactions within a population by affecting the 
      spatial distribution of individuals. In disturbed habitats where resources are 
      limiting, spatial relationships should reflect behavioural differences among 
      individuals, with higher-quality resources controlled by dominant individuals. In 
      contrast, all individuals may exploit preferred resources in resource-rich 
      habitats. Environmental variation and population reorganization may also result 
      in variation in morphological, behavioural and ecological traits, which 
      ultimately affect fitness. We addressed these considerations for male tree 
      lizards (Urosaurus ornatus) at three sites that differ in levels of disturbance. 
      The habitats at these localities differed in the availability of live trees, the 
      preferred microhabitat of U. ornatus. In addition, male U. ornatus exhibits a 
      polymorphism in dewlap colour linked with differences in aggression, which should 
      influence their position in a network and access to resources. We applied a 
      network framework to characterize the spatial organization of male morphs at each 
      site and quantified male aggressive behaviour in the laboratory. We also compared 
      body size, body condition, number of bite marks, parasite load and the 
      microhabitat use and diet, of males among the sites. We detected no significant 
      differences in spatial network structure between unburned and infrequently burned 
      sites. However, at a frequently burned site, the network shifted towards 
      geographically closer, heteromorphic male neighbour associations. Males at this 
      site were also larger, more aggressive and had more bite marks but fewer 
      parasites than males at the other sites. Moreover, we detected divergence in 
      microhabitat use and diet among the morphs at the frequently burned site that 
      reflected the shift in spatial network structure and differences in morph 
      behaviour. That is, only more aggressive morphs usurped trees and consumed prey 
      from higher trophic levels. We conclude that environmental variation may 
      influence animal spatial network structure. Jointly, behavioural and 
      environmental variation may promote despotic social dynamics and ecological 
      divergence in resource-limited habitats.

LID - 20202817
AB  - Seasonal resource pulses can have enormous impacts on species interactions. In 
      marine ecosystems, air-breathing predators often drive their prey to deeper 
      waters. However, it is unclear how ephemeral resource pulses such as near-surface 
      phytoplankton blooms alter the vertical trade-off between predation avoidance and 
      resource availability in consumers, and how these changes cascade to the diving 
      behaviour of top predators. We integrated data on Weddell seal diving behaviour, 
      diet stable isotopes, feeding success and mass gain to examine shifts in vertical 
      foraging throughout ice break-out and the resulting phytoplankton bloom each 
      year. We also tested hypotheses about the likely location of phytoplankton bloom 
      origination (advected or produced in situ where seals foraged) based on sea ice 
      break-out phenology and advection rates from several locations within 150 km of 
      the seal colony. In early summer, seals foraged at deeper depths resulting in 
      lower feeding rates and mass gain. As sea ice extent decreased throughout the 
      summer, seals foraged at shallower depths and benefited from more efficient 
      energy intake. Changes in diving depth were not due to seasonal shifts in seal 
      diets or horizontal space use and instead may reflect a change in the vertical 
      distribution of prey. Correspondence between the timing of seal shallowing and 
      the resource pulse was variable from year to year and could not be readily 
      explained by our existing understanding of the ocean and ice dynamics. 
      Phytoplankton advection occurred faster than ice break-out, and seal dive 
      shallowing occurred substantially earlier than local break-out. While there 
      remains much to be learned about the marine ecosystem, it appears that an 
      increase in prey abundance and accessibility via shallower distributions during 
      the resource pulse could synchronize life-history phenology across trophic levels 
      in this high-latitude ecosystem.

AB  - Niche theory fundamentally contributed to the understanding of animal diversity. 
      However, in soil, the diversity of animals seems enigmatic since the soil is a 
      rather homogeneous habitat, and soil animals are often generalist feeders. A new 
      approach to understand soil animal diversity is the use of ecological 
      stoichiometry. The elemental composition of animals may explain their occurrence, 
      distribution, and density. This approach has been used before in soil macrofauna, 
      but this study is the first to investigate soil mesofauna. Using inductively 
      coupled plasma optic emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), we analyzed the 
      concentration of a wide range of elements (Al, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P, S, 
      Zn) in 15 soil mite taxa (Oribatida, Mesostigmata) from the litter of two 
      different forest types (beech, spruce) in Central Europe (Germany). Additionally, 
      the concentration of carbon and nitrogen, and their stable isotope ratios 
      ((15)N/(14)N, (13)C/(12)C), reflecting their trophic niche, were measured. We 
      hypothesized that (1) stoichiometry differs between mite taxa, (2) stoichiometry 
      of mite taxa occurring in both forest types is not different, and (3) element 
      composition is correlated to trophic level as indicated by (15)N/(14)N ratios. 
      The results showed that stoichiometric niches of soil mite taxa differed 
      considerably indicating that elemental composition is an important niche 
      dimension of soil animal taxa. Further, stoichiometric niches of the studied taxa 
      did not differ significantly between the two forest types. Calcium was negatively 
      correlated with trophic level indicating that taxa incorporating calcium 
      carbonate in their cuticle for defense occupy lower trophic positions in the food 
      web. Furthermore, a positive correlation of phosphorus with trophic level 
      indicated that taxa higher in the food web have higher energetic demand. Overall, 
      the results indicate that ecological stoichiometry of soil animals is a promising 
      tool for understanding their diversity and functioning.

TI  - Exploring diet shifts and ecology in modern sharks using calcium isotopes and 
      trace metal records of their teeth.
LID - 10.1111/jfb.15211 [doi]
AB  - Sharks occupy all living environments of the marine realm as well as some 
      freshwater systems. They display varied and flexible feeding behaviours, but 
      understanding their diet remains challenging due to their elusive ecology and the 
      invasiveness of stomach content analyses in regard of their threatened status. As 
      a potential alternative, we discuss the variability in δ(44/42) Ca values 
      recorded in the tooth enamel of size-graded individuals belonging to three 
      species of large sharks with distinct diets (Isurus oxyrinchus, Hexanchus griseus 
      and Carcharodon carcharias). The preliminary results highlight shifts in diet 
      linked to ontogeny (I. oxyrinchus and H. griseus) and spatial distribution (C. 
      carcharias) characterizing feeding behaviour in these species at individual and 
      population level. These outcomes agree with the results of traditional stomach 
      analyses supporting that nontraditional stable isotopes thus represent new 
      perspectives for the study of modern and extinct shark ecology. In addition, for 
      the first time, the Sr/Ca elemental ratios measured in H. griseus reflect sexual 
      differences that could be interpreted in terms of spatial segregation or 
      physiological heterogeneities.

TI  - Syntrophic Acetate-Oxidizing Microbial Consortia Enriched from Full-Scale 
      Mesophilic Food Waste Anaerobic Digesters Showing High Biodiversity and 
      Functional Redundancy.
PG  - e0033922

AB  - Syntrophic acetate oxidation (SAO) coupled with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis 
      (HM) plays a vital role in the anaerobic digestion of protein-rich feedstocks 
      such as food wastes. However, current knowledge of the biodiversity and genetic 
      potential of the involved microbial participants, especially syntrophic 
      acetate-oxidizing bacteria (SAOB), is limited due to the low abundance of these 
      microorganisms and challenges in their isolation. The intent of this study was to 
      enrich and identify potential SAOB. Therefore, we conducted continuous acetate 
      feeding under high ammonia concentrations using two separate inoculum consortia 
      of microorganisms that originated from full-scale mesophilic food waste 
      digesters, which lasted for more than 200 days. Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon and 
      metagenomic analyses, we observed a convergence of the experimental microbial 
      communities during the enrichment regarding taxonomic composition and metabolic 
      functional composition. Stable carbon isotope analyses of biogas indicated that 
      SAO-HM was the dominant methanogenic pathway during the enrichment process. The 
      hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanoculleus dominated the archaeal community. The 
      enriched SAO community featured high biodiversity and metabolic functional 
      redundancy. By analyzing the metagenome-assembled genomes, the known SAOB 
      Syntrophaceticus schinkii and six uncultured populations were identified to have 
      the genetic potential to perform SAO through the conventional reversed 
      Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, while another six bacteria were found to encode the 
      reversed Wood-Ljungdahl pathway combined with a glycine cleavage system as novel 
      SAOB candidates. These results showed that the food waste anaerobic digesters 
      harbor diverse SAOB and highlighted the importance of the glycine cleavage system 
      for acetate oxidation. IMPORTANCE Syntrophic acetate oxidation to CO(2) and H(2), 
      together with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, contributes to much of the carbon 
      flux in the anaerobic digestion of organic wastes, especially at high ammonia 
      concentrations. A deep understanding of the biodiversity, metabolic genetic 
      potential, and ecology of the SAO community can help to improve biomethane 
      production from wastes for clean energy production. Here, we enriched the SAO-HM 
      functional guild obtained from full-scale food waste anaerobic digesters and 
      recorded dynamic changes in community taxonomic composition and functional 
      profiles. By reconstructing the metabolic pathways, diverse known and novel 
      bacterial members were found to have SAO potential via the reversed 
      Wood-Ljungdahl (WL) pathway alone, or via the reversed WL pathway with a glycine 
      cleavage system (WLP-GCS), and those catalyzing WLP-GCS showed higher microbial 
      abundance. This study revealed the biodiversity and metabolic functional 
      redundancy of SAOB in full-scale anaerobic digester systems and provided 
      inspiration for further genome-centric studies.

AB  - Hydrothermal sulfide chimneys located along the global system of oceanic 
      spreading centers are habitats for microbial life during active venting. 
      Hydrothermally extinct, or inactive, sulfide deposits also host microbial 
      communities at globally distributed sites. The main goal of this study is to 
      describe Fe transformation pathways, through precipitation and 
      oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions, and examine transformation products for 
      signatures of biological activity using Fe mineralogy and stable isotope 
      approaches. The study includes active and inactive sulfides from the East Pacific 
      Rise 9°50'N vent field. First, the mineralogy of Fe(III)-bearing precipitates is 
      investigated using microprobe X-ray absorption spectroscopy (μXAS) and X-ray 
      diffraction (μXRD). Second, laser-ablation (LA) and micro-drilling (MD) are used 
      to obtain spatially-resolved Fe stable isotope analysis by 
      multicollector-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). Eight 
      Fe-bearing minerals representing three mineralogical classes are present in the 
      samples: oxyhydroxides, secondary phyllosilicates, and sulfides. For Fe 
      oxyhydroxides within chimney walls and layers of Si-rich material, enrichments in 
      both heavy and light Fe isotopes relative to pyrite are observed, yielding a 
      range of δ(57)Fe values up to 6‰. Overall, several pathways for Fe transformation 
      are observed. Pathway 1 is characterized by precipitation of primary sulfide 
      minerals from Fe(II)aq-rich fluids in zones of mixing between vent fluids and 
      seawater. Pathway 2 is also consistent with zones of mixing but involves 
      precipitation of sulfide minerals from Fe(II)aq generated by Fe(III) reduction. 
      Pathway 3 is direct oxidation of Fe(II) aq from hydrothermal fluids to form 
      Fe(III) precipitates. Finally, Pathway 4 involves oxidative alteration of 
      pre-existing sulfide minerals to form Fe(III). The Fe mineralogy and isotope data 
      do not support or refute a unique biological role in sulfide alteration. The 
      findings reveal a dynamic range of Fe transformation pathways consistent with a 
      continuum of micro-environments having variable redox conditions. These 
      micro-environments likely support redox cycling of Fe and S and are consistent 
      with culture-dependent and -independent assessments of microbial physiology and 
      genetic diversity of hydrothermal sulfide deposits.

TI  - Testing foraging optimization models in brown bears: Time for a paradigm shift in 
      nutritional ecology?
PG  - e4228
LID - 10.1002/ecy.4228 [doi]
AB  - How organisms obtain energy to survive and reproduce is fundamental to ecology, 
      yet researchers use theoretical concepts represented by simplified models to 
      estimate diet and predict community interactions. Such simplistic models can 
      sometimes limit our understanding of ecological principles. We used a polyphagous 
      species with a wide distribution, the brown bear (Ursus arctos), to illustrate 
      how disparate theoretical frameworks in ecology can affect conclusions regarding 
      ecological communities. We used stable isotope measurements (δ(13) C, δ(15) N) 
      from hairs of individually monitored bears in Sweden and Bayesian mixing models 
      to estimate dietary proportions of ants, moose, and three berry species to 
      compare with other brown bear populations. We also developed three hypotheses 
      based on predominant foraging literature, and then compared predicted diets to 
      field estimates. Our three models assumed (1) bears forage to optimize caloric 
      efficiency (optimum foraging model), predicting bears predominately eat berries 
      (~70% of diet) and opportunistically feed on moose (Alces alces) and ants 
      (Formica spp. and Camponotus spp; ~15% each); (2) bears maximize meat intake 
      (maximizing fitness model), predicting a diet of 35%-50% moose, followed by ants 
      (~30%), and berries (~15%); (3) bears forage to optimize macronutrient balance 
      (macronutrient model), predicting a diet of ~22% (dry weight) or 17% 
      metabolizable energy from proteins, with the rest made up of carbohydrates and 
      lipids (~49% and 29% dry matter or 53% and 30% metabolizable energy, 
      respectively). Bears primarily consumed bilberries (Vaccinium myrtillus; 
      50%-55%), followed by lingonberries (V. vitis-idaea; 22%-30%), crowberries 
      (Empetrum nigrum; 8%-15%), ants (5%-8%), and moose (3%-4%). Dry matter dietary 
      protein was lower than predicted by the maximizing fitness model and the 
      macronutrient balancing model, but protein made up a larger proportion of the 
      metabolizable energy than predicted. While diets most closely resembled 
      predictions from optimal foraging theory, none of the foraging hypotheses fully 
      described the relationship between foraging and ecological niches in brown bears. 
      Acknowledging and broadening models based on foraging theories is more likely to 
      foster novel discoveries and insights into the role of polyphagous species in 
      ecosystems and we encourage this approach.

TI  - Individual dietary specialization reduces intraspecific competition, rather than 
      feeding activity, in black amur bream (Megalobrama terminalis).

AB  - Individual specialization and high plasticity in feeding activity are common in 
      natural populations. However, the role of these two in intraspecific competition 
      is unclear. In this study, the rhythm of feeding activity, dietary composition, 
      niche width, niche overlap, and individual specialization was explored in four 
      different size groups of black amur bream (Megalobrama terminalis), using 
      microscopic identification of foregut contents and stable isotope analysis 
      (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) of dorsal muscle. Both methods observed ontogenetic shifts in 
      dietary preference and individual specializations, and revealed that the total 
      niche width of large individuals was greater than small individuals. Mixed linear 
      models indicated that feeding activity was significantly influenced by time 
      (p < 0.0001), and no significant changes among size groups was evident 
      (p = 0.244). Niche overlaps revealed that there was intensive diet competition 
      between different size groups of black amur bream. Individual specialization in 
      small juveniles was likely to be stronger than sub-adult and adult groups. 
      Pearson's correlation analysis revealed that the individual specialization was 
      positively correlated with mean diet similarity within a group. The results 
      indicated that intraspecific competition is reduced mainly by individual dietary 
      specialization, rather than shift in feeding activity.

TI  - Changes in Root-Shoot Allometric Relations in Alpine Norway Spruce Trees After 
      Strip Cutting.

AB  - Silvicultural interventions such as strip cuttings can change the resource 
      availability of the edge trees. This may alter tree allometry, as light regime, 
      water, and nutrient availability can change at the forest edge. Increased root 
      growth may optimize resource uptake and/or enhance tree anchorage to withstand 
      the altered wind regime. However, little is known about the patterns of the 
      root-shoot allometric responses to strip cuttings. In three alpine stands 
      differing in climate, site productivity, and stand characteristics, we selected 
      71 Norway spruce trees and took increment cores from stems, root collars, and 
      main roots. This enabled us to study changes in the long-term root-stem allometry 
      for 46 years and short-term allometric responses to intervention. The effects of 
      cutting were compared between edge trees and trees from the stand interior in 10 
      years before and after the intervention. The long-term allocation to roots 
      increased with stem diameter, with the strongest effects on the regularly managed 
      stand with the tallest and largest trees. These results support the allometric 
      biomass partitioning theory, which postulates resource allocation patterns 
      between different plant organs to depend on plant size. Strip cutting on 
      north-facing slopes boosted edge-tree growth in all plant compartments and 
      enhanced allocation to roots. This change in allometry started 2 years after 
      cutting but disappeared 7-8 years later. In the post-cutting period, the highest 
      root-shoot increase was observed in the small trees independent of the site. This 
      indicates the change in growing conditions to have the strongest effects in 
      formerly suppressed trees. Thus, the effect of such acclimation on the wind 
      firmness of subdominant spruce trees is a question with high importance for 
      optimizing cutting layouts in lowering post-cutting vulnerability to disturbance. 
      The results from this case study contribute to a better understanding of the 
      structural acclimation of spruce trees from high-elevation forests to new forest 
      edges. However, for a more mechanistic understanding of environmental drivers, 
      further analyses of tree-ring stable isotopes are recommended.

TI  - A century of mercury: Ecosystem-wide changes drive increasing contamination of a

AB  - Mercury (Hg) is a highly toxic metal that adversely impacts human and wildlife 
      health. The amount of Hg released globally in the environment has increased 
      steadily since the Industrial Revolution, resulting in growing contamination in 
      biota. Seabirds have been extensively studied to monitor Hg contamination in the 
      world's oceans. Multidecadal increases in seabird Hg contamination have been 
      documented in polar, temperate and subtropical regions, whereas in tropical 
      regions they are largely unknown. Since seabirds accumulate Hg mainly from their 
      diet, their trophic ecology is fundamental in understanding their Hg exposure 
      over time. Here, we used the sooty tern (Onychoprion fuscatus), the most abundant 
      tropical seabird, as bioindicator of temporal variations in Hg transfer to marine 
      predators in tropical ecosystems, in response to trophic changes and other 
      potential drivers. Body feathers were sampled from 220 sooty terns, from museum 
      specimens (n = 134) and free-living birds (n = 86) from Ascension Island, in the 
      South Atlantic Ocean, over 145 years (1876-2021). Chemical analyses included (i) 
      total- and methyl-Hg, and (ii) carbon (δ(1)³C) and nitrogen (δ(15)N) stable 
      isotopes, as proxies of foraging habitat and trophic position, respectively, to 
      investigate the relationship between trophic ecology and Hg contamination over 
      time. Despite current regulations on its global emissions, mean Hg concentrations 
      were 58.9% higher in the 2020s (2.0 μg g(-1), n = 34) than in the 1920s 
      (1.2 μg g(-1), n = 107). Feather Hg concentrations were negatively and positively 
      associated with δ(1)³C and δ(15)N values, respectively. The sharp decline of 2.9 
      ‰ in δ(1)³C values over time indicates ecosystem-wide changes (shifting primary 
      productivity) in the tropical South Atlantic Ocean and can help explain the 
      observed increase in terns' feather Hg concentrations. Overall, this study 
      provides invaluable information on how ecosystem-wide changes can increase Hg 
      contamination of tropical marine predators and reinforces the need for long-term 
      regulations of harmful contaminants at the global scale.

AB  - Rapid climate warming is decreasing sea ice thickness, extent and duration. 
      Marine mammals such as bearded (Erignathus barbatus) and ringed (Pusa hispida) 
      seals, which use sea ice for pupping, molting and resting, may be negatively 
      affected. Claws from bearded and ringed seals store up to 14 and 12 years of 
      sequential analyte data, respectively. These data can be used to compare 
      reproduction, stress and diet across decades. In this study, we compare 
      progesterone, cortisol and carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes in female bearded 
      and ringed seals during 1953-1968 (pre-1968, a period prior to sea ice decline) 
      to 1998-2014 (post-1998, a period during sea ice decline). When comparing these 
      periods, bearded seals had statistically higher cortisol concentrations 
      post-1998, and for both species δ(13)C was more negative post-1998, while 
      progesterone and δ(15)N did not change. There was a positive relationship between 
      progesterone and cortisol Z-scores for both species, except for ringed seals 
      post-1998. There was a negative relationship between cortisol Z-scores and δ(13)C 
      for bearded seals evident in post-1998 indicating that higher cortisol Z-scores 
      are associated with more negative δ(13)C in bearded seals in recent years. This 
      negative relationship between cortisol and δ(13)C in bearded seals suggests a 
      shift to higher prey diversity, possibly due to changes in sea ice in the Pacific 
      Arctic evident post 1998. Progesterone Z-scores corresponded to expected 
      differences among non-pregnant, unimplanted, implanted and post-partum 
      individuals. Using these data, pregnancy history was determined for reproductive 
      years for each individual female sampled, which could allow for yearly pregnancy 
      rates to be calculated given a large enough representative sample of the 
      population. These results combine decades of observational studies with hormones 
      and stable isotopes to infer changes in reproduction, stress and diet, as well as 
      the connection between these life history parameters.

TI  - Anaerobic Sulfur Oxidation Underlies Adaptation of a Chemosynthetic Symbiont to 
      Oxic-Anoxic Interfaces.
PG  - e0118620
LID - 10.1128/mSystems.01186-20 [doi]
LID - e01186-20
AB  - Chemosynthetic symbioses occur worldwide in marine habitats, but comprehensive 
      physiological studies of chemoautotrophic bacteria thriving on animals are 
      scarce. Stilbonematinae are coated by thiotrophic Gammaproteobacteria. As these 
      nematodes migrate through the redox zone, their ectosymbionts experience varying 
      oxygen concentrations. However, nothing is known about how these variations 
      affect their physiology. Here, by applying omics, Raman microspectroscopy, and 
      stable isotope labeling, we investigated the effect of oxygen on "Candidatus 
      Thiosymbion oneisti." Unexpectedly, sulfur oxidation genes were upregulated in 
      anoxic relative to oxic conditions, but carbon fixation genes and incorporation 
      of (13)C-labeled bicarbonate were not. Instead, several genes involved in carbon 
      fixation were upregulated under oxic conditions, together with genes involved in 
      organic carbon assimilation, polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biosynthesis, nitrogen 
      fixation, and urea utilization. Furthermore, in the presence of oxygen, 
      stress-related genes were upregulated together with vitamin biosynthesis genes 
      likely necessary to withstand oxidative stress, and the symbiont appeared to 
      proliferate less. Based on its physiological response to oxygen, we propose that 
      "Ca. T. oneisti" may exploit anaerobic sulfur oxidation coupled to 
      denitrification to proliferate in anoxic sand. However, the ectosymbiont would 
      still profit from the oxygen available in superficial sand, as the 
      energy-efficient aerobic respiration would facilitate carbon and nitrogen 
      assimilation. IMPORTANCE Chemoautotrophic endosymbionts are famous for exploiting 
      sulfur oxidization to feed marine organisms with fixed carbon. However, the 
      physiology of thiotrophic bacteria thriving on the surface of animals 
      (ectosymbionts) is less understood. One longstanding hypothesis posits that 
      attachment to animals that migrate between reduced and oxic environments would 
      boost sulfur oxidation, as the ectosymbionts would alternatively access sulfide 
      and oxygen, the most favorable electron acceptor. Here, we investigated the 
      effect of oxygen on the physiology of "Candidatus Thiosymbion oneisti," a 
      gammaproteobacterium which lives attached to marine nematodes inhabiting 
      shallow-water sand. Surprisingly, sulfur oxidation genes were upregulated under 
      anoxic relative to oxic conditions. Furthermore, under anoxia, the ectosymbiont 
      appeared to be less stressed and to proliferate more. We propose that 
      animal-mediated access to oxygen, rather than enhancing sulfur oxidation, would 
      facilitate assimilation of carbon and nitrogen by the ectosymbiont.

AB  - We sampled clapper rail (Rallus crepitans) feathers from museum specimens 
      collected between 1965 and 2010 to investigate changes in mercury (Hg) 
      availability in coastal marshes of New Hanover County, North Carolina. Stable 
      isotope analysis (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) was conducted to control for dietary shifts 
      that may have influenced Hg exposure. Hg concentrations ranged from 0.96 to 
      9.22 μg/g (ppm), but showed no significant trend over time; diet (δ(15)N) or 
      foraging habitat (δ(13)C) also provided little to no explanatory power to the 
      variation in Hg concentrations among clapper rails. Our findings suggest the 
      bioavailability of Hg to clapper rails in coastal North Carolina salt marshes has 
      remained consistent over time, despite the global trend of increasing mercury in 
      many other bird species, providing an excellent baseline for any future 
      assessment of Hg availability to salt marsh birds in coastal North Carolina.

TI  - Bioavailability of red wine and grape seed proanthocyanidins in rats.
PG  - 3986-4001
LID - 10.1039/d0fo00350f [doi]
AB  - This study explored plasma levels and urinary and fecal excretion of metabolites 
      and microbial-derived catabolites over a 24 h period following the ingestion of 
      red wine (RWP) or grape seed (GSP) proanthocyanidin-rich extracts by rats. In 
      total, 35 structurally-related (epi)catechin metabolites (SREMs) and 5-carbon 
      side chain ring fission metabolites (5C-RFMs) (phenyl-γ-valerolactones and 
      phenylvaleric acids), and 50 phenolic acid and aromatic catabolites were detected 
      after intakes of both extracts. The consumption of the RWP extract, but not the 
      GSP extract, led to the appearance of a ∼200 nmol L(-1) peak plasma concentration 
      of SREMs formed from flavan-3-ol monomers. In contrast, ingestion of the GSPs, 
      but not the RWPs, resulted in a substantial increase in microbiota-derived 
      5-carbon side chain ring fission metabolites (5C-RFMs) in plasma. 5C-RFMs, along 
      with low molecular weight phenolic catabolites were detected in urine after 
      ingestion of both extracts. The GSP and RWP extracts had respective mean degrees 
      of polymerisation 5.9 and 6.5 subunits, and the RWP extract had an upper polymer 
      size of 21 subunits compared to 44 subunits for the GSP extract. The differences 
      in plasma metabolite profiles might, therefore, be a consequence of this 
      polydispersity impacting on the microbiota-mediated rates of cleavage of the 
      proanthocyanidin subunits and their subsequent metabolism and absorption. Urinary 
      excretion of phenolic catabolites indicated that 11% of RWPs and 7% for GSPs were 
      subjected to microbial degradation. In all probability these figures, rather than 
      representing the percentage of proanthocyanidins that are completely degraded, 
      indicate partial cleavage of monomer subunits producing a much higher percentage 
      of shortened proanthocyanidin chains. Obtaining more detailed information on the 
      in vivo fate of proanthocyanidins is challenging because of the difficulties in 
      analysing unabsorbed parent proanthocyanidins and their partially degraded 
      flavan-3-ol subunit chains in feces. Further progress awaits the development of 
      improved purification and analytical techniques for proanthocyanidins and their 
      use in feeding studies, and in vitro fecal and bacterial incubations, with radio 
      and/or stable isotope-labelled substrates.

      carbon (delta(13)C) and nitrogen (delta(15)N) were monitored simultaneously in 
      body tissue and mucus for up to 101 days in feeding or fasting Lumbricus festivus 
      kept in an artificial substrate. When the diet of the earthworms was switched 
      from clover (C(3) plant, legume) to maize (C(4), non-legume), the new dietary 
      delta(13)C signature manifested itself much more rapidly in the mucus than in the 
      body tissue of the animals, causing a delta(13)C shift of about 4 per thousand in 
      mucus and 1 per thousand in tissue after 13.5 days. Turnover of earthworm body 
      tissue carbon, unlike that of mucus carbon, was described adequately by an 
      exponential, single-pool model. Nitrogen turnover could not be assessed because 
      the delta(15)N difference between sources was too small. Fasting for 56 days did 
      not result in the expected whole-body (15)N or (13)C enrichment, but it caused a 
      significant decrease in mucus and tissue C:N ratios and in the ratio (mucus C:N 
      ratio):(tissue C:N ratio). We conclude that the separate analysis of body tissue 
      and mucus has great potential for studying the ecophysiology, feeding ecology and 
      role in elemental cycling of earthworms and other invertebrates.

AB  - Large carnivores (order Carnivora) are among the world's most threatened mammals 
      due to a confluence of ecological and social forces that have unfolded over 
      centuries. Combining specimens from natural history collections with documents 
      from archival records, we reconstructed the factors surrounding the extinction of 
      the California grizzly bear (Ursus arctos californicus), a once-abundant brown 
      bear subspecies last seen in 1924. Historical documents portrayed California 
      grizzlies as massive hypercarnivores that endangered public safety. Yet, 
      morphological measurements on skulls and teeth generate smaller body size 
      estimates in alignment with extant North American grizzly populations (approx. 
      200 kg). Stable isotope analysis (δ(13)C, δ(15)N) of pelts and bones (n = 57) 
      revealed that grizzlies derived less than 10% of their nutrition from terrestrial 
      animal sources and were therefore largely herbivorous for millennia prior to the 
      first European arrival in this region in 1542. Later colonial land uses, 
      beginning in 1769 with the Mission era, led grizzlies to moderately increase 
      animal protein consumption (up to 26% of diet), but grizzlies still consumed far 
      less livestock than otherwise claimed by contemporary accounts. We show how human 
      activities can provoke short-term behavioural shifts, such as heightened levels 
      of carnivory, that in turn can lead to exaggerated predation narratives and 
      incentivize persecution, triggering rapid loss of an otherwise widespread and 
      ecologically flexible animal.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Conventional methods of agricultural pest control and crop 
      fertilisation are unsustainable. To meet growing demand, we must find 
      ecologically responsible means to control disease and promote crop yields. The 
      root-associated microbiome can aid plants with disease suppression, abiotic 
      stress relief, and nutrient bioavailability. The aim of the present work was to 
      profile the community of bacteria, fungi, and archaea associated with the wheat 
      rhizosphere and root endosphere in different conditions. We also aimed to use 
      (13)CO(2) stable isotope probing (SIP) to identify microbes within the root 
      compartments that were capable of utilising host-derived carbon. RESULTS: 
      Metabarcoding revealed that community composition shifted significantly for 
      bacteria, fungi, and archaea across compartments. This shift was most pronounced 
      for bacteria and fungi, while we observed weaker selection on the ammonia 
      oxidising archaea-dominated archaeal community. Across multiple soil types we 
      found that soil inoculum was a significant driver of endosphere community 
      composition, however, several bacterial families were identified as core enriched 
      taxa in all soil conditions. The most abundant of these were Streptomycetaceae 
      and Burkholderiaceae. Moreover, as the plants senesce, both families were reduced 
      in abundance, indicating that input from the living plant was required to 
      maintain their abundance in the endosphere. Stable isotope probing showed that 
      bacterial taxa within the Burkholderiaceae family, among other core enriched taxa 
      such as Pseudomonadaceae, were able to use root exudates, but Streptomycetaceae 
      were not. CONCLUSIONS: The consistent enrichment of Streptomycetaceae and 
      Burkholderiaceae within the endosphere, and their reduced abundance after 
      developmental senescence, indicated a significant role for these families within 
      the wheat root microbiome. While Streptomycetaceae did not utilise root exudates 
      in the rhizosphere, we provide evidence that Pseudomonadaceae and 
      Burkholderiaceae family taxa are recruited to the wheat root community via root 
      exudates. This deeper understanding crop microbiome formation will enable 
      researchers to characterise these interactions further, and possibly contribute 
      to ecologically responsible methods for yield improvement and biocontrol in the 
      future.

TI  - Whole grains beyond fibre: what can metabolomics tell us about mechanisms?
PG  - 320-7
LID - 10.1017/S0029665114001542 [doi]
AB  - Dietary fibre alone does not fully explain the frequent association between 
      greater intake of whole grains and reduced risk of disease in observational 
      studies, and other phytochemicals or food structure may also play an important 
      role. For all the observational evidence for the benefits of a whole-grain-rich 
      diet, we have only limited knowledge of the mechanisms behind this reduction in 
      disease risk, aside from the action of specific cereal fibres on reduction of 
      blood cholesterol and the post-prandial glucose peak. Nutritional metabolomics, 
      the global measurement and interpretation of metabolic profiles, assesses the 
      interaction of food with the endogenous gene-protein cascade and the gut 
      microbiome. This approach allows the generation of new hypotheses which account 
      for systemic effects, rather than just focusing on one or two mechanisms or 
      metabolic pathways. To date, animal and human trials using metabolomics to 
      investigate mechanistic changes to metabolism on eating whole grains and cereal 
      fractions have led to new hypotheses around mechanistic effects of whole grains. 
      These include the role of cereals as a major source of dietary glycine betaine, a 
      possible effect on phospholipid synthesis or metabolism, the role of 
      branched-chain amino acids and improvements in insulin sensitivity, and the 
      possibility that whole grains may have an effect on protein metabolism. These 
      hypotheses help explain some of the observed effects of whole grains, although 
      mechanistic studies using stable isotopes and fully quantitative measures are 
      required to confirm these potential mechanisms.

TI  - Dietary niche breadth influences the effects of urbanization on the gut 
      microbiota of sympatric rodents.
PG  - e9216

LID - e9216
AB  - Cities are among the most extreme forms of anthropogenic ecosystem modification, 
      and urbanization processes exert profound effects on animal populations through 
      multiple ecological pathways. Increased access to human-associated food items may 
      alter species' foraging behavior and diet, in turn modifying the normal microbial 
      community of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), ultimately impacting their health. 
      It is crucial we understand the role of dietary niche breadth and the resulting 
      shift in the gut microbiota as urban animals navigate novel dietary resources. We 
      combined stable isotope analysis of hair and microbiome analysis of four gut 
      regions across the GIT to investigate the effects of urbanization on the diet and 
      gut microbiota of two sympatric species of rodents with different dietary niches: 
      the omnivorous large Japanese field mouse (Apodemus speciosus) and the relatively 
      more herbivorous gray red-backed vole (Myodes rufocanus). Both species exhibited 
      an expanded dietary niche width within the urban areas potentially attributable 
      to novel anthropogenic foods and altered resource availability. We detected a 
      dietary shift in which urban A. speciosus consumed more terrestrial animal 
      protein and M. rufocanus more plant leaves and stems. Such changes in resource 
      use may be associated with an altered gut microbial community structure. There 
      was an increased abundance of the presumably probiotic Lactobacillus in the small 
      intestine of urban A. speciosus and potentially pathogenic Helicobacter in the 
      colon of M. rufocanus. Together, these results suggest that even taxonomically 
      similar species may exhibit divergent responses to urbanization with consequences 
      for the gut microbiota and broader ecological interactions.

TI  - Pallid bands in feathers and associated stable isotope signatures reveal effects 
      of severe weather stressors on fledgling sparrows.
PG  - e814
LID - 10.7717/peerj.814 [doi]
LID - e814
AB  - In August 2013, we observed a high incidence (44%) of synchronous bands of 
      reduced melanin (a type of fault bar we have termed "pallid bands") across the 
      rectrices of juvenile Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodrammus savannarum) captured near 
      El Reno, Oklahoma. Earlier that year, on May 31, the site was struck by a severe 
      storm which rained hailstones exceeding 5.5 cm diameter and spawned an historic 
      4.2 km-wide tornado <8 km to the south of the site. We hypothesized that this 
      stressor had induced the pallid bands. An assessment of Grasshopper Sparrow 
      nesting phenology indicated that a large number of nestlings were likely growing 
      tail feathers when the storm hit. The pallid bands were restricted to the distal 
      half of feathers and their widths significantly increased as a function of 
      distance from the tip (i.e., age at formation). We predicted that if stress had 
      caused these pallid bands, then a spike in circulating δ (15)N originating from 
      tissue catabolism during the stress response would have been incorporated into 
      the developing feather. From 18 juveniles captured at the site in August we 
      measured δ (15)N and δ (13)C stable isotope ratios within four to five 0.25-0.40 
      mg feather sections taken from the distal end of a tail feather; the pallid band, 
      if present, was contained within only one section. After accounting for 
      individual and across-section variation, we found support for our prediction that 
      feather sections containing or located immediately proximal to pallid bands 
      (i.e., the pallid band region) would show significantly higher δ (15)N than 
      sections outside this region. In contrast, the feathers of juveniles with pallid 
      bands compared to normal appearing juveniles showed significantly lower δ (15)N. 
      A likely explanation is that the latter individuals hatched after the May 31 
      storm and had consumed a trophically-shifted diet relative to juveniles with 
      pallid bands. Considering this, the juveniles of normal appearance were 
      significantly less abundant within our sample relative to expectations from past 
      cohorts (z = - 2.03; p = 0.042) and, in as much, suggested widespread nest losses 
      during the storm. Severe weather events may represent major stressors to 
      ground-nesting birds, especially for recent fledglings. We call for others to 
      exploit opportunities to study the effects of severe weather when these rare but 
      devastating stressors impact established field research sites.

AB  - Amino acids are an important and highly dynamic fraction of organic N in soils 
      and their determination in soil without derivatization is challenging due to the 
      difficulties in separation and detection of trace amounts of these polar 
      analytes. In the present work, we developed an analytical method to quantify 20 
      free amino acids in aqueous soil extracts without derivatization. The method 
      employed hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
      (HILIC-MS/MS) technique combined with a cation exchange solid phase extraction 
      (SPE). Four stable isotope labelled amino acids were used as internal standards 
      to improve the method performance. Good separation of 20 underivatized amino 
      acids was achieved within 12min. The limit of detection (LODs) and limit of 
      quantification (LOQs) were in the range of 13-384ngg(-1) and 43-1267ngg(-1) (dry 
      soil basis), respectively. The results showed that overall recoveries with high 
      precision were obtained for the extracted free amino acids from ten different 
      soils. The overall recoveries of 18 amino acids were similar for the ten soils 
      used, which differed substantially in organic C content and in other properties 
      as soil texture and pH. For most of the amino acids, the average recoveries from 
      soil extracts were between 74% and 117%, with the exception of Met (31%), Pro 
      (52%) and Arg (68%). Variability was within acceptable limits (relative standard 
      deviations were between 4% and 13%), with the exception of Met (relative standard 
      deviation=90%) and Arg (relative standard deviation=53%). Thus the proposed 
      method with high throughout and high analyte specificity shows great promise for 
      consistent analysis of free amino acids extracted from soils and offers new 
      horizons for the analysis of amino acids in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem.

AB  - Urbanization and the persistent environmental changes present a major challenge 
      for urban freshwaters and availability of water for humans and wildlife. In order 
      to increase understanding of urban ecohydrology, we investigated the variability 
      of planktonic bacteria and benthic diatoms - as two key biological indicators - 
      coupled with insights from hydrochemistry and stable water isotopes across four 
      urban streams characterized by different dominant water sources in Berlin, the 
      German capital, over a period of one year (2021-2022). DNA metabarcoding results 
      show that substantial spatio-temporal variability exists across urban streams in 
      terms of microbial diversity and richness, with clear links to abiotic factors 
      and nutrient concentrations. Bacterial communities showed clear distinction 
      between effluent-impacted and non-effluent impacted streams as well as clear 
      seasonal turnover. In-stream benthic diatom assemblages also showed robust 
      seasonal variation as well as high species diversity. Our multiple-tracer 
      approach is relevant for emerging questions regarding the increased use of 
      treated effluent to supplement declining baseflows, the assessment of stream 
      restoration projects and the impact of storm drainage and surface pollution on 
      aquatic ecosystem health. eDNA analysis allows analysis of spatial and temporal 
      patterns not feasibly studied with traditional analyses of macroinvertebrates. 
      This can ultimately be leveraged for future water resource management and 
      restoration planning and monitoring of urban freshwater systems across 
      metropolitan areas.

TI  - Palaeoenvironmental modelling of δ(13) C and δ(15) N values in the North Atlantic 
      Islands: understanding past marine resource use.
PG  - 2399-406
LID - 10.1002/rcm.6319 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Carbon (δ(13) C) and nitrogen (δ(15) N) analysis has been extensively 
      used to investigate the importance of marine foods in the diet of archaeological 
      populations in the North Atlantic Islands; however, few faunal studies exist to 
      aid the interpretation of results. Palaeoenvironmental modelling of δ(13) C and 
      δ(15) N values is crucial in determining whether changes in the stable isotope 
      values are a result of dietary change, rather than temporal or geographical 
      fluctuations in carbon and nitrogen. Investigating faunal dietary behaviour can 
      provide an insight into past foddering and land management strategies. METHODS: 
      Detailed sampling of wild and domestic species for bulk collagen analysis was 
      undertaken in order to characterise geographical variations in δ(13) C and δ(15) 
      N values in the Outer Hebrides and Orkney. Samples from the Neolithic to the 
      Norse period were analysed to assess temporal and geographical variations in 
      δ(13) C and δ(15) N values, in addition to determining the contribution of marine 
      foods to the diet of local fauna. RESULTS: A δ(15) N shift of 1‰ was observed 
      between the Outer Hebrides and Orkney in the Neolithic and Iron Age. A 
      geographical variation in δ(13) C values was observed in the Norse period between 
      Orkney and the Outer Hebrides. Temporal fluctuations in δ(13) C and δ(15) N 
      values demonstrate variations in foddering practices of sheep in the Outer 
      Hebrides. Pig specimens from the Outer Hebrides demonstrated evidence of marine 
      food consumption in the Iron Age. CONCLUSIONS: Faunal dietary behaviour can act 
      as a vital indicator of the importance of marine resources in the past. 
      Characterisation of faunal δ(13) C and δ(15) N values geographically and 
      temporally is crucial in our interpretation of human dietary behaviour.

TI  - The evolution of dog diet and foraging: Insights from archaeological canids in 
      Siberia.
PG  - eabo6493
LID - 10.1126/sciadv.abo6493 [doi]
AB  - Research on the evolution of dog foraging and diet has largely focused on 
      scavenging during their initial domestication and genetic adaptations to 
      starch-rich food environments following the advent of agriculture. The Siberian 
      archaeological record evidences other critical shifts in dog foraging and diet 
      that likely characterize Holocene dogs globally. By the Middle Holocene, body 
      size reconstruction for Siberia dogs indicates that most were far smaller than 
      Pleistocene wolves. This contributed to dogs' tendencies to scavenge, feed on 
      small prey, and reduce social foraging. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope 
      analysis of Siberian dogs reveals that their diets were more diverse than those 
      of Pleistocene wolves. This included habitual consumption of marine and 
      freshwater foods by the Middle Holocene and reliance on C(4) foods by the Late 
      Holocene. Feeding on such foods and anthropogenic waste increased dogs' exposure 
      to microbes, affected their gut microbiomes, and shaped long-term dog population 
      history.

TI  - Recovery in methanotrophic activity does not reflect on the methane-driven 
      interaction network after peat mining.

AB  - Aerobic methanotrophs are crucial in ombrotrophic peatlands, driving the methane 
      and nitrogen cycles. Peat mining adversely affects the methanotrophs, but 
      activity and community composition/abundances may recover after restoration. 
      Considering that the methanotrophic activity and growth are significantly 
      stimulated in the presence of other microorganisms, the methane-driven 
      interaction network, encompassing methanotrophs and non-methanotrophs (i.e., 
      methanotrophic interactome), may also be relevant in conferring community 
      resilience. Yet, little is known of the response and recovery of the 
      methanotrophic interactome to disturbances. Here, we determined the recovery of 
      the methanotrophic interactome as inferred by a co-occurrence network analysis, 
      comparing a pristine and restored peatland. We coupled a DNA-based stable isotope 
      probing (SIP) approach using (13)C-CH(4) to a co-occurrence network analysis 
      derived from the (13)C-enriched 16S rRNA gene sequences to relate the response in 
      methanotrophic activity to the structuring of the interaction network. 
      Methanotrophic activity and abundances recovered after peat restoration since 
      2000. 'Methylomonaceae' was the predominantly active methanotrophs in both 
      peatlands, but differed in the relative abundance of Methylacidiphilaceae and 
      Methylocystis However, bacterial community composition was distinct in both 
      peatlands. Likewise, the methanotrophic interactome was profoundly altered in the 
      restored peatland. Structuring of the interaction network after peat mining 
      resulted in the loss of complexity and modularity, indicating a less connected 
      and efficient network, which may have consequences in the event of 
      recurring/future disturbances. Therefore, determining the response of the 
      methane-driven interaction network, in addition to relating methanotrophic 
      activity to community composition/abundances, provided a more comprehensive 
      understanding of the resilience of the methanotrophs.Importance The resilience 
      and recovery of microorganisms from disturbances are often determined with regard 
      to their activity and community composition/abundances. Rarely has the response 
      of the network of interacting microorganisms been considered, despite 
      accumulating evidence showing that microbial interaction modulates community 
      functioning. Comparing the methane-driven interaction network of a pristine and 
      restored peatland, our findings revealed that the metabolically active 
      microorganisms were less connected and formed less modular 'hubs' in the restored 
      peatland, indicative of a less complex network which may have consequences with 
      recurring disturbances and environmental changes. This also suggests that the 
      resilience and full recovery in the methanotrophic activity and abundances do not 
      reflect on the interaction network. Therefore, it is relevant to consider the 
      interaction-induced response, in addition to documenting changes in activity and 
      community composition/abundances, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the 
      resilience of microorganisms to disturbances.
